It is the second largest [[single-payer healthcare]] system in the world, losing only to the Brazilian [[Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade]]. Primarily funded by the government from general taxation (plus a small amount from [[National Insurance]] contributions), and overseen by the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], the NHS provides [[healthcare]] to all legal English residents and residents from other regions of the UK, with most services free at the point of use. Some services, such as emergency treatment and treatment of infectious diseases, are free for everyone, including visitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1086.aspx?categoryid=68 |title=Am I entitled to NHS treatment when I visit England? |work=www.nhs.uk}}</ref>\n\nFree healthcare at the point of use comes from the core principles at the founding of the National Health Service. The 1942 Beveridge cross party report established the principles of the NHS which was implemented by the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] in 1948. In practice, \"free at the point of use\" normally means that anyone legitimately and fully registered with the system (i.e., in possession of an [[NHS number]]), available to legal UK residents regardless of nationality (but not non-resident British citizens), can access the full breadth of critical and non-critical medical care, without payment except for some specific NHS services, for example [[eye test]]s, [[Dentistry|dental care]], [[Prescription charges|prescriptions]] and aspects of [[long-term care]]. These charges are usually lower than equivalent services provided by a private provider and many are free to vulnerable or low-income patients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/dentist/nhs-private-prices.html |title=UK Dentist Prices \u2013 Compare NHS and Private Dental Treatment Costs |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/health/optician-prices.html |title=Optician and Eye Care Prices \u2013 Compare the Cost of Eye Tests |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe NHS provides the majority of healthcare in England, including [[primary care]], [[hospital|in-patient care]], [[long-term care|long-term healthcare]], [[ophthalmology]] and [[dentistry]]. The [[National Health Service Act 1946]] came into effect on 5 July 1948. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance: it is used by about 8% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS services.\n\nThe NHS is largely funded from general taxation, with a small amount being contributed by [[National Insurance]] payments<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/nhs/10542622/The-awkward-truth-about-funding-the-NHS.html</ref> and from fees levied in accordance with recent changes in the [[Immigration Act 2014]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-health-surcharge-information-for-migrants |title=Immigration health surcharge: information for migrants |accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> The UK government department responsible for the NHS is the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], headed by the [[Secretary of State for Health and Social Care]]. On 9 January 2018, the Department of Health was renamed the Department of Health and Social Care. The Department of Health had a \u00a3110 billion budget in 2013\u201314, most of this being spent on the NHS.\n\n== Organisation ==\nThe NHS was established within the differing nations of the United Kingdom through differing legislation, and such there has never been a singular British healthcare system, instead there are 4 health services in the United Kingdom; NHS England, the [[NHS Scotland]], [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland|HSC Northern Ireland]] and [[NHS Wales]], which were run by the respective UK government ministries for each home nation before falling under the control of devolved governments in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wales.nhs.uk/nhswalesaboutus/historycontext |title= NHS Wales \u2013 About Us: History & Context |publisher=NHS Wales |accessdate=3 August 2014|date= 2006-10-23 }}</ref>  In 2009, NHS England agreed to a formal [[NHS Constitution for England|NHS constitution]], which sets out the legal rights and responsibilities of the NHS, its staff, and users of the service, and makes additional non-binding pledges regarding many key aspects of its operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_093419 |title=NHS Constitution for England.

Starting in April 2013, [[Primary Care Trust]]s (PCTs) began to be replaced by General Practitioner (GP)-led organisations called [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s (CCGs). Under the new system, a new NHS Commissioning Board, called [[NHS England]], oversees the NHS from the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]].<ref name=\"The changing NHS\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-19674838 |title=The changing NHS |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2014|work=BBC News }}</ref> The Act has also become associated with the perception of increased private provision of NHS services. In reality, the provision of NHS services by private companies long precedes this legislation, but there are concerns that the new role of the healthcare regulator ('Monitor') could lead to increased use of private sector competition, balancing care options between private companies, charities, and NHS organisations.<ref name=\"The changing NHS\" /> NHS Trusts responded to the [[Nicholson challenge]]\u2014which involved making \u00a320 billion in savings across the service by 2015.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the National Health Service (England)}}\n[[File:Aneurin Bevan and his wife Jenny Lee in Corwen (15368872658).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aneurin Bevan]].

Cronin]]'s controversial novel ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'', published in 1937, had fomented extensive debate about the severe inadequacies of healthcare. The author's innovative ideas were not only essential to the conception of the NHS, but in fact, his best-selling novels are said to have greatly contributed to the Labour Party's victory in 1945.<ref>R. Samuel, \"North and South,\" ''London Review of Books'' 17.12 (22 June 1995): 3-6.</ref>\n\nA national [[health]] service was one of the fundamental assumptions in the [[Beveridge Report]]. The [[Emergency Hospital Service]] established in 1939 gave a taste of what a National Health Service might look like.\n\nHealthcare prior to the war had been an unsatisfactory mix of private, municipal and charity schemes. Bevan decided that the way forward was a national system rather than a system operated by local authorities. He proposed that each resident of the UK would be signed up to a specific [[General practitioner|General Practice]] (GP) as the point of entry into the system, building on the foundations laid in 1912 by the introduction of [[National Insurance]] and the list system for general practice. Patients would have access to all medical, dental and nursing care they needed without having to pay for it at the time.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Thatcherism]] represented a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the [[post-war consensus]], wherein the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of [[Keynesianism]], the welfare state, the mixed economy, supplies both of public and private housing, and close regulation of the economy. There was one major exception: the National Health Service, which was widely popular and had wide support inside the Conservative Party. In 1982, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised Britons that the NHS is \"safe in our hands.\"<ref>Rudolf Klein, \"Why Britain's conservatives support a socialist health care system.\" ''Health Affairs'' 4#1 (1985): 41-58.

At its launch by the then minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, on 5 July 1948, it had at its heart three core principles:\n* That it meet the needs of everyone\n* That it be free at the point of delivery\n* That it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay\n\nThese three principles have guided the development of the NHS over more than half a century and remain. However, in July 2000, a full-scale modernisation programme was launched and new principles added.}}\n\nThe main aims of the additional principles are that the NHS will:\n* Provide a comprehensive range of services\n* Shape its services around the needs and preferences of individual patients, their families and their carers\n* Respond to the different needs of different populations\n* Work continuously to improve the quality of services and to minimise errors\n* Support and value its staff\n* Use public funds for healthcare devoted solely to NHS patients\n* Work with others to ensure a seamless service for patients\n* Help to keep people healthy and work to reduce health inequalities\n* Respect the confidentiality of individual patients and provide open access to information about services, treatment and performance\n\n=== Structure ===\n{{Main|Health and Social Care Act 2012}}\nThe English NHS is controlled by the UK government through the [[Department of Health and Social Care]] (DHSC), which takes political responsibility for the service.

PCTs disbursed funds to them on an agreed tariff or contract basis, on guidelines set out by the Department of Health. The PCTs budget from the Department of Health was calculated on a formula basis relating to population and specific local needs. They were supposed to \"break even\" - that is, not show a deficit on their budgets at the end of the financial year. Failure to meet financial objectives could result in the dismissal and replacement of a Trust's Board of Directors, although such dismissals are enormously expensive for the NHS.<ref>{{cite web | title=Anger over C difficile payoff | publisher=Health Service Journal | url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/home/anger-over-c-difficile-pay-off/538529.article | date=25 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom April 2013 a new system was established as a result of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].  The NHS budget is largely in the hands of a new body, NHS England.  NHS England commission specialist services and primary care.  Acute services and community care is commissioned by local [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s led by GPs.\n\n=== Free services and contributory services ===\n\n==== Services free at the point of use ====\n\nThe vast majority of NHS services are free at the point of use.\n\nThis means that people generally do not pay anything for their doctor visits, nursing services, surgical procedures or appliances, consumables such as medications and bandages, plasters, medical tests, and investigations, x-rays, CT or MRI scans or other diagnostic services. Hospital inpatient and outpatient services are free, both medical and mental health services. Funding for these services is provided through general taxation and not a specific tax.\n\nBecause the NHS is not funded by contributory insurance scheme in the ordinary sense and most patients pay nothing for their treatment there is thus no billing to the treated person nor to any insurer or sickness fund as is common in many other countries. This saves hugely on administration costs that might otherwise involve complex consumable tracking and usage procedures at the patient level and concomitant invoicing,  reconciliation and bad debt processing.\n\n=== Eligibility ===\n\nEligibility for NHS services is based on having [[ordinary resident status]]. See [[National Health Service Eligibility for treatment]].\n\n==== Prescription charges ====\n\n{{As of|2019|May}} the NHS prescription charge in England was \u00a39 for each quantity of medicine<ref>{{NHS Web Site|url=https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs|title=NHS charges|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref> (which contrasts with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland<ref>{{cite news|title=Prescription costs scrapped in Northern Ireland|publisher=BBC News|date=1 April 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8598011.stm|accessdate= 6 August 2010}}</ref> where items prescribed on the NHS are free). People over sixty, children under sixteen (or under nineteen if in full-time education), patients with certain medical conditions, and those with low incomes, are exempt from paying. Those who require repeated prescriptions may purchase a single-charge pre-payment certificate that allows unlimited prescriptions during its period of validity. The charge is the same regardless of the actual cost of the medicine, but higher charges apply to medical appliances. Pharmacies or other dispensing contractors are reimbursed for the cost of the medicines through NHS Prescription Services, a division of the NHS Business Services Authority. For more details of prescription charges, see [[Prescription charges]].\n\nThe high and rising costs of some medicines, especially some types of cancer treatment, means that prescriptions can present a heavy burden to the [[NHS Primary Care Trust|PCTs]], whose limited budgets include responsibility for the difference between medicine costs and the fixed prescription charge. This has led to disputes whether some expensive drugs (e.g., [[Herceptin]]) should be prescribed by the NHS.<ref>{{cite news|title=Q&A: The Herceptin judgement|publisher=BBC News|date=12 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4684852.stm|accessdate=15 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== NHS dentistry ====\n{{Main|NHS dentistry}}\n\nWhere available, NHS dentistry charges {{As of|2017|April|lc=on}} were: \u00a320.60 for an examination; \u00a356.30 for a filling or extraction; and \u00a3244.30 for more complex procedures such as crowns, dentures or bridges.<ref>{{cite web | title = Help with dental charges - Health Costs | publisher = NHS Choices | url = http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/Healthcosts/pages/Dentalcosts.aspx | accessdate = 8 April 2015 }}</ref> As of 2007, less than half of dentists' income came from treating patients under NHS coverage; about 52% of dentists' income was from treating private patients.<ref>{{cite news | title = Call for dentists' NHS-work quota &#124; BBC| date =  3 June 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6711379.stm | work=BBC News | accessdate=19 May 2010 | first=Nick | last=Triggle}}</ref>  Some people needing NHS dental care are unable to get it.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41113507 'We couldn't see an NHS dentist so we pulled out our own teeth'] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\n==== NHS Optical Services ====\n{{main|Eye care in the United Kingdom}}\nFrom 1 April 2007 the NHS Sight Test Fee (in England) was \u00a319.32, and there were 13.1 million NHS sight tests carried out in the UK.\n\nFor those who qualify through need, the sight test is free, and a voucher system is employed to pay for or reduce the cost of lenses.  There is a free spectacles frame and most opticians keep a selection of low-cost items.  For those who already receive certain means-tested benefits, or who otherwise qualify, participating opticians use tables to find the amount of the subsidy.\n\n==== Injury cost recovery scheme ====\nUnder older legislation (mainly the [[Road Traffic Act 1930]]) a hospital treating the victims of a road traffic accident was entitled to limited compensation (under the 1930 Act before any amendment, up to \u00a325 per person treated) from the insurers of driver(s) of the vehicle(s) involved, but were not compelled to do so and often did not do so; the charge was in turn covered by the then legally required element of those drivers' motor vehicle insurance (commonly known as ''Road Traffic Act insurance'' when a driver held only that amount of insurance). As the initial bill went to the driver rather than the insurer, even when a charge was imposed it was often not passed on to the liable insurer. It was common to take no further action in such cases, as there was no practical financial incentive (and often a financial disincentive due to potential legal costs) for individual hospitals to do so.\n\nThe Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 introduced a standard national scheme for recovery of costs using a tariff based on a single charge for out-patient treatment or a daily charge for in-patient treatment; these charges again ultimately fell upon insurers. This scheme did not however fully cover the costs of treatment in serious cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nSince January 2007, the NHS has a duty to claim back the cost of treatment, and for ambulance services, for those who have been paid personal injury compensation.<ref>{{cite web |title=NHS Injury Cost Recovery scheme |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>  In the last year of the scheme immediately preceding 2007, over \u00a3128 million was reclaimed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Totals for England, Scotland and Wales \u2013 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=137500&Rendition=Web |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom April 2019 \u00a3725 is payable for outpatient treatment, \u00a3891 per day for inpatient treatment and \u00a3219 per ambulance journey.<ref>{{cite news |title=NHS Charges: Increase for accidents from 1 April 2019 |url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=79087cd9-7147-4188-9cf4-dc2a871321b9 |accessdate=16 April 2019 |publisher=Lexology |date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Car park charges ====\nCar parking charges are a minor source of revenue for the NHS,<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\">{{cite news |title=NHS car park charges \u2013 a necessary evil? |author=Nick Triggle |date=3 March 2008 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7274968.stm |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref> with most hospitals deriving about 0.25% of their budget from them.<ref name=\"t_20060718\" />  The level of fees is controlled individually by each trust.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" />  In 2006 car park fees contributed \u00a378 million towards hospital budgets.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" /><ref name=\"t_20060718\">{{cite news |title=Hospitals making \u00a378m a year from car park charges |date=18 July 2006 |publisher=Times Newspapers |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article689109.ece |accessdate=10 March 2008 | location=London | first=David | last=Charter}}</ref>  Patient groups are opposed to such charges.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" />  (This contrasts with Scotland where car park charges were mostly scrapped from the beginning of 2009<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7593400.stm NHS car parking charges abolished] BBC News, 2 September 2008</ref> and with Wales where car park charges were scrapped at the end of 2011.)<ref name=\"t_20080303\">{{cite news |title=Welsh NHS scraps car park charges |author=David Rose |date=3 March 2008|publisher=Times Newspapers |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3474721.ece |accessdate=10 February 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==== Charitable funds ====\nThere are over 300 official NHS charities in England and Wales.

This was outlined in the Griffiths Report of 1983.<!--\n  --><ref>{{cite book | author=Manfred Davidmann| title=Reorganising the National Health Service: An Evaluation of the Griffiths Report | edition=Second | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-85192-046-7 | url=http://www.solbaram.org/articles/nhs.html | publisher=Social Organisation | location=Stanmore}}</ref>\nThis recommended the appointment of general managers in the NHS with whom responsibility should lie. The report also recommended that clinicians be better involved in management. Financial pressures continued to place strain on the NHS. In 1987, an additional \u00a3101 million was provided by the government to the NHS. In 1988 [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] announced a review of the NHS. From this review in 1989 two [[white paper]]s ''Working for Patients'' and ''Caring for People'' were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the ''internal market'', which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade.\n\nIn England, the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]] defined this \"internal market\", whereby health authorities ceased to run hospitals but \"purchased\" care from their own or other authorities' hospitals.  Certain GPs became \"fund holders\" and were able to purchase care for their patients.  The \"providers\" became [[NHS trust|independent trusts]], which encouraged competition but also increased [[Postcode lottery|local differences]]. Increasing competition may have been statistically associated with poor patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = NHS competition 'costs lives'\n| accessdate = 10 May 2008\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2701899.stm\n| date=29 January 2003\n| publisher=BBC News\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Changes under the Blair government ===\n\nThese innovations, especially the \"fund holder\" option, were condemned at the time by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Opposition to what was claimed to be the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] intention to [[privatise]] the NHS became a major feature of Labour's election campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nLabour came to power in 1997 with the promise to remove the \"internal market\" and abolish fundholding.  However, in his second term Blair renounced this direction. He pursued measures to strengthen the internal market as part of his plan to \"modernise\" the NHS.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nA number of factors drove these reforms; they include the rising costs of medical technology and medicines, the desire to improve standards and \"patient choice\", an ageing population, and a desire to contain government expenditure. (Since the National Health Services in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not controlled by the UK government, these reforms have increased the differences between the National Health Services in different parts of the United Kingdom. See [[NHS Wales]] and [[NHS Scotland]] for descriptions of their developments).\n\nReforms included (amongst other actions) the laying down of detailed [[Standards for Better Health|service standards]], strict financial budgeting, revised job specifications, reintroduction of \"fundholding\" (under the description \"practice-based commissioning\"), closure of surplus facilities and emphasis on rigorous [[clinical governance|clinical]] and [[corporate governance]].  Some new services were developed to help manage demand, including [[NHS Direct]]. The [[Agenda for Change]] agreement aimed to provide harmonised pay and career progression.  These changes have given rise to controversy within the medical professions, the news media and the public. The [[British Medical Association]] in a 2009 document on [[Independent Sector Treatment Centre]]s (ISTCs) urged the government to restore the NHS to a service based on public provision, not private ownership; co-operation, not competition; integration, not fragmentation; and public service, not private profits.<ref name=BMAonISTCs>{{cite web|url=http://lookafterournhs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/independent-sector-treatment-centres-01062.pdf |title=BMA document on ISTCs |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tony Blair|Blair]] government, whilst leaving services free at point of use, encouraged outsourcing of medical services and support to the private sector.

Over a quarter of patients were not asked if they smoke and nearly three quarters of smokers were not asked if they wanted to stop.  Half of frontline hospital staff were offered no training in smoking cessation.  Smoking patients should be offered specialised help to stop and nicotine replacement.  There should be dedicated staff helping patients to quit.  Seven tenths of smokers say they want to stop and those offered help are four times more likely to stop permanently.  PHE claims smoking causes 96,000 deaths per year in England and twenty times the number of smoking related illnesses.  Frank Ryan, psychologist said, \"It's really about refocusing our efforts and motivating our service users and staff to quit.  And of course, whatever investment we make in smoking cessation programmes, there's a payback many times more in terms of the health benefits and even factors such as attendance at work, because it's workers who smoke [who] tend to have more absent spells from work.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39094713|title=NHS 'tobacco free' campaign launched by Public Health England|date=26 February 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}</ref>  The numbers of smokers getting help to quit has fallen due to cuts in funding for smoking cessation care though the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] recommends such help.

The 1942 Beveridge cross party report established the principles of the NHS which was implemented by the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] in 1948. In practice, \"free at the point of use\" normally means that anyone legitimately and fully registered with the system (i.e., in possession of an [[NHS number]]), available to legal UK residents regardless of nationality (but not non-resident British citizens), can access the full breadth of critical and non-critical medical care, without payment except for some specific NHS services, for example [[eye test]]s, [[Dentistry|dental care]], [[Prescription charges|prescriptions]] and aspects of [[long-term care]]. These charges are usually lower than equivalent services provided by a private provider and many are free to vulnerable or low-income patients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/dentist/nhs-private-prices.html |title=UK Dentist Prices \u2013 Compare NHS and Private Dental Treatment Costs |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/health/optician-prices.html |title=Optician and Eye Care Prices \u2013 Compare the Cost of Eye Tests |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe NHS provides the majority of healthcare in England, including [[primary care]], [[hospital|in-patient care]], [[long-term care|long-term healthcare]], [[ophthalmology]] and [[dentistry]]. The [[National Health Service Act 1946]] came into effect on 5 July 1948. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance: it is used by about 8% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS services.\n\nThe NHS is largely funded from general taxation, with a small amount being contributed by [[National Insurance]] payments<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/nhs/10542622/The-awkward-truth-about-funding-the-NHS.html</ref> and from fees levied in accordance with recent changes in the [[Immigration Act 2014]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-health-surcharge-information-for-migrants |title=Immigration health surcharge: information for migrants |accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> The UK government department responsible for the NHS is the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], headed by the [[Secretary of State for Health and Social Care]].

Starting in April 2013, [[Primary Care Trust]]s (PCTs) began to be replaced by General Practitioner (GP)-led organisations called [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s (CCGs).

In reality, the provision of NHS services by private companies long precedes this legislation, but there are concerns that the new role of the healthcare regulator ('Monitor') could lead to increased use of private sector competition, balancing care options between private companies, charities, and NHS organisations.<ref name=\"The changing NHS\" /> NHS Trusts responded to the [[Nicholson challenge]]\u2014which involved making \u00a320 billion in savings across the service by 2015.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the National Health Service (England)}}\n[[File:Aneurin Bevan and his wife Jenny Lee in Corwen (15368872658).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aneurin Bevan]].

Cronin]]'s controversial novel ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'', published in 1937, had fomented extensive debate about the severe inadequacies of healthcare. The author's innovative ideas were not only essential to the conception of the NHS, but in fact, his best-selling novels are said to have greatly contributed to the Labour Party's victory in 1945.<ref>R. Samuel, \"North and South,\" ''London Review of Books'' 17.12 (22 June 1995): 3-6.</ref>\n\nA national [[health]] service was one of the fundamental assumptions in the [[Beveridge Report]]. The [[Emergency Hospital Service]] established in 1939 gave a taste of what a National Health Service might look like.\n\nHealthcare prior to the war had been an unsatisfactory mix of private, municipal and charity schemes. Bevan decided that the way forward was a national system rather than a system operated by local authorities. He proposed that each resident of the UK would be signed up to a specific [[General practitioner|General Practice]] (GP) as the point of entry into the system, building on the foundations laid in 1912 by the introduction of [[National Insurance]] and the list system for general practice. Patients would have access to all medical, dental and nursing care they needed without having to pay for it at the time.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Thatcherism]] represented a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the [[post-war consensus]], wherein the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of [[Keynesianism]], the welfare state, the mixed economy, supplies both of public and private housing, and close regulation of the economy. There was one major exception: the National Health Service, which was widely popular and had wide support inside the Conservative Party. In 1982, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised Britons that the NHS is \"safe in our hands.\"<ref>Rudolf Klein, \"Why Britain's conservatives support a socialist health care system.\" ''Health Affairs'' 4#1 (1985): 41-58.

At its launch by the then minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, on 5 July 1948, it had at its heart three core principles:\n* That it meet the needs of everyone\n* That it be free at the point of delivery\n* That it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay\n\nThese three principles have guided the development of the NHS over more than half a century and remain. However, in July 2000, a full-scale modernisation programme was launched and new principles added.}}\n\nThe main aims of the additional principles are that the NHS will:\n* Provide a comprehensive range of services\n* Shape its services around the needs and preferences of individual patients, their families and their carers\n* Respond to the different needs of different populations\n* Work continuously to improve the quality of services and to minimise errors\n* Support and value its staff\n* Use public funds for healthcare devoted solely to NHS patients\n* Work with others to ensure a seamless service for patients\n* Help to keep people healthy and work to reduce health inequalities\n* Respect the confidentiality of individual patients and provide open access to information about services, treatment and performance\n\n=== Structure ===\n{{Main|Health and Social Care Act 2012}}\nThe English NHS is controlled by the UK government through the [[Department of Health and Social Care]] (DHSC), which takes political responsibility for the service.

Acute services and community care is commissioned by local [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s led by GPs.\n\n=== Free services and contributory services ===\n\n==== Services free at the point of use ====\n\nThe vast majority of NHS services are free at the point of use.\n\nThis means that people generally do not pay anything for their doctor visits, nursing services, surgical procedures or appliances, consumables such as medications and bandages, plasters, medical tests, and investigations, x-rays, CT or MRI scans or other diagnostic services. Hospital inpatient and outpatient services are free, both medical and mental health services. Funding for these services is provided through general taxation and not a specific tax.\n\nBecause the NHS is not funded by contributory insurance scheme in the ordinary sense and most patients pay nothing for their treatment there is thus no billing to the treated person nor to any insurer or sickness fund as is common in many other countries. This saves hugely on administration costs that might otherwise involve complex consumable tracking and usage procedures at the patient level and concomitant invoicing,  reconciliation and bad debt processing.\n\n=== Eligibility ===\n\nEligibility for NHS services is based on having [[ordinary resident status]]. See [[National Health Service Eligibility for treatment]].\n\n==== Prescription charges ====\n\n{{As of|2019|May}} the NHS prescription charge in England was \u00a39 for each quantity of medicine<ref>{{NHS Web Site|url=https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs|title=NHS charges|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref> (which contrasts with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland<ref>{{cite news|title=Prescription costs scrapped in Northern Ireland|publisher=BBC News|date=1 April 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8598011.stm|accessdate= 6 August 2010}}</ref> where items prescribed on the NHS are free). People over sixty, children under sixteen (or under nineteen if in full-time education), patients with certain medical conditions, and those with low incomes, are exempt from paying. Those who require repeated prescriptions may purchase a single-charge pre-payment certificate that allows unlimited prescriptions during its period of validity. The charge is the same regardless of the actual cost of the medicine, but higher charges apply to medical appliances. Pharmacies or other dispensing contractors are reimbursed for the cost of the medicines through NHS Prescription Services, a division of the NHS Business Services Authority. For more details of prescription charges, see [[Prescription charges]].\n\nThe high and rising costs of some medicines, especially some types of cancer treatment, means that prescriptions can present a heavy burden to the [[NHS Primary Care Trust|PCTs]], whose limited budgets include responsibility for the difference between medicine costs and the fixed prescription charge. This has led to disputes whether some expensive drugs (e.g., [[Herceptin]]) should be prescribed by the NHS.<ref>{{cite news|title=Q&A: The Herceptin judgement|publisher=BBC News|date=12 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4684852.stm|accessdate=15 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== NHS dentistry ====\n{{Main|NHS dentistry}}\n\nWhere available, NHS dentistry charges {{As of|2017|April|lc=on}} were: \u00a320.60 for an examination; \u00a356.30 for a filling or extraction; and \u00a3244.30 for more complex procedures such as crowns, dentures or bridges.<ref>{{cite web | title = Help with dental charges - Health Costs | publisher = NHS Choices | url = http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/Healthcosts/pages/Dentalcosts.aspx | accessdate = 8 April 2015 }}</ref> As of 2007, less than half of dentists' income came from treating patients under NHS coverage; about 52% of dentists' income was from treating private patients.<ref>{{cite news | title = Call for dentists' NHS-work quota &#124; BBC| date =  3 June 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6711379.stm | work=BBC News | accessdate=19 May 2010 | first=Nick | last=Triggle}}</ref>  Some people needing NHS dental care are unable to get it.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41113507 'We couldn't see an NHS dentist so we pulled out our own teeth'] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\n==== NHS Optical Services ====\n{{main|Eye care in the United Kingdom}}\nFrom 1 April 2007 the NHS Sight Test Fee (in England) was \u00a319.32, and there were 13.1 million NHS sight tests carried out in the UK.\n\nFor those who qualify through need, the sight test is free, and a voucher system is employed to pay for or reduce the cost of lenses.  There is a free spectacles frame and most opticians keep a selection of low-cost items.  For those who already receive certain means-tested benefits, or who otherwise qualify, participating opticians use tables to find the amount of the subsidy.\n\n==== Injury cost recovery scheme ====\nUnder older legislation (mainly the [[Road Traffic Act 1930]]) a hospital treating the victims of a road traffic accident was entitled to limited compensation (under the 1930 Act before any amendment, up to \u00a325 per person treated) from the insurers of driver(s) of the vehicle(s) involved, but were not compelled to do so and often did not do so; the charge was in turn covered by the then legally required element of those drivers' motor vehicle insurance (commonly known as ''Road Traffic Act insurance'' when a driver held only that amount of insurance). As the initial bill went to the driver rather than the insurer, even when a charge was imposed it was often not passed on to the liable insurer. It was common to take no further action in such cases, as there was no practical financial incentive (and often a financial disincentive due to potential legal costs) for individual hospitals to do so.\n\nThe Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 introduced a standard national scheme for recovery of costs using a tariff based on a single charge for out-patient treatment or a daily charge for in-patient treatment; these charges again ultimately fell upon insurers. This scheme did not however fully cover the costs of treatment in serious cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nSince January 2007, the NHS has a duty to claim back the cost of treatment, and for ambulance services, for those who have been paid personal injury compensation.<ref>{{cite web |title=NHS Injury Cost Recovery scheme |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>  In the last year of the scheme immediately preceding 2007, over \u00a3128 million was reclaimed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Totals for England, Scotland and Wales \u2013 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=137500&Rendition=Web |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom April 2019 \u00a3725 is payable for outpatient treatment, \u00a3891 per day for inpatient treatment and \u00a3219 per ambulance journey.<ref>{{cite news |title=NHS Charges: Increase for accidents from 1 April 2019 |url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=79087cd9-7147-4188-9cf4-dc2a871321b9 |accessdate=16 April 2019 |publisher=Lexology |date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Car park charges ====\nCar parking charges are a minor source of revenue for the NHS,<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\">{{cite news |title=NHS car park charges \u2013 a necessary evil? |author=Nick Triggle |date=3 March 2008 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7274968.stm |accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref> with most hospitals deriving about 0.25% of their budget from them.<ref name=\"t_20060718\" />  The level of fees is controlled individually by each trust.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" />  In 2006 car park fees contributed \u00a378 million towards hospital budgets.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" /><ref name=\"t_20060718\">{{cite news |title=Hospitals making \u00a378m a year from car park charges |date=18 July 2006 |publisher=Times Newspapers |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article689109.ece |accessdate=10 March 2008 | location=London | first=David | last=Charter}}</ref>  Patient groups are opposed to such charges.<ref name=\"bbc_20080303\" />  (This contrasts with Scotland where car park charges were mostly scrapped from the beginning of 2009<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7593400.stm NHS car parking charges abolished] BBC News, 2 September 2008</ref> and with Wales where car park charges were scrapped at the end of 2011.)<ref name=\"t_20080303\">{{cite news |title=Welsh NHS scraps car park charges |author=David Rose |date=3 March 2008|publisher=Times Newspapers |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3474721.ece |accessdate=10 February 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==== Charitable funds ====\nThere are over 300 official NHS charities in England and Wales.

This was outlined in the Griffiths Report of 1983.<!--\n  --><ref>{{cite book | author=Manfred Davidmann| title=Reorganising the National Health Service: An Evaluation of the Griffiths Report | edition=Second | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-85192-046-7 | url=http://www.solbaram.org/articles/nhs.html | publisher=Social Organisation | location=Stanmore}}</ref>\nThis recommended the appointment of general managers in the NHS with whom responsibility should lie. The report also recommended that clinicians be better involved in management. Financial pressures continued to place strain on the NHS. In 1987, an additional \u00a3101 million was provided by the government to the NHS. In 1988 [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] announced a review of the NHS. From this review in 1989 two [[white paper]]s ''Working for Patients'' and ''Caring for People'' were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the ''internal market'', which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade.\n\nIn England, the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]] defined this \"internal market\", whereby health authorities ceased to run hospitals but \"purchased\" care from their own or other authorities' hospitals.  Certain GPs became \"fund holders\" and were able to purchase care for their patients.  The \"providers\" became [[NHS trust|independent trusts]], which encouraged competition but also increased [[Postcode lottery|local differences]]. Increasing competition may have been statistically associated with poor patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = NHS competition 'costs lives'\n| accessdate = 10 May 2008\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2701899.stm\n| date=29 January 2003\n| publisher=BBC News\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Changes under the Blair government ===\n\nThese innovations, especially the \"fund holder\" option, were condemned at the time by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Opposition to what was claimed to be the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] intention to [[privatise]] the NHS became a major feature of Labour's election campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nLabour came to power in 1997 with the promise to remove the \"internal market\" and abolish fundholding.  However, in his second term Blair renounced this direction. He pursued measures to strengthen the internal market as part of his plan to \"modernise\" the NHS.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nA number of factors drove these reforms; they include the rising costs of medical technology and medicines, the desire to improve standards and \"patient choice\", an ageing population, and a desire to contain government expenditure. (Since the National Health Services in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not controlled by the UK government, these reforms have increased the differences between the National Health Services in different parts of the United Kingdom. See [[NHS Wales]] and [[NHS Scotland]] for descriptions of their developments).\n\nReforms included (amongst other actions) the laying down of detailed [[Standards for Better Health|service standards]], strict financial budgeting, revised job specifications, reintroduction of \"fundholding\" (under the description \"practice-based commissioning\"), closure of surplus facilities and emphasis on rigorous [[clinical governance|clinical]] and [[corporate governance]].  Some new services were developed to help manage demand, including [[NHS Direct]]. The [[Agenda for Change]] agreement aimed to provide harmonised pay and career progression.  These changes have given rise to controversy within the medical professions, the news media and the public. The [[British Medical Association]] in a 2009 document on [[Independent Sector Treatment Centre]]s (ISTCs) urged the government to restore the NHS to a service based on public provision, not private ownership; co-operation, not competition; integration, not fragmentation; and public service, not private profits.<ref name=BMAonISTCs>{{cite web|url=http://lookafterournhs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/independent-sector-treatment-centres-01062.pdf |title=BMA document on ISTCs |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tony Blair|Blair]] government, whilst leaving services free at point of use, encouraged outsourcing of medical services and support to the private sector. Under the [[Private Finance Initiative]], an increasing number of hospitals were built (or rebuilt) by private sector consortia; hospitals may have both medical services such as ISTCs<ref>{{cite web | title = New generation surgery-centres to carry out thousands more NHS operations every year | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] |date=3 December 2002 | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/PressReleases/PressReleasesNotices/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4026000&chk=0NNhMe | accessdate = 15 September 2006}}</ref> and non-medical services such as catering provided under long-term contracts by the private sector.

A 2002 plan was for NHSIA to implement four national IT projects: Basic infrastructure, Electronic records, Electronic prescribing, and Electronic booking, modelled after the large [[NHS Direct]] tele-nurse and healthcare website program.<ref name=\"gamble\" /> The NHSIA functions were divided into other organisations by April 2005.\n\nIn 2002, the [[NHS Connecting for Health|NHS National Programme for IT]] (NPfIT) was announced by the Department of Health.

[[Public Health England]] (PHE) wants all hospitals to help smokers quit.  One in thirteen smoking patients was referred to a hospital or community based cessation programme.  Over a quarter of patients were not asked if they smoke and nearly three quarters of smokers were not asked if they wanted to stop.  Half of frontline hospital staff were offered no training in smoking cessation.  Smoking patients should be offered specialised help to stop and nicotine replacement.  There should be dedicated staff helping patients to quit.  Seven tenths of smokers say they want to stop and those offered help are four times more likely to stop permanently.  PHE claims smoking causes 96,000 deaths per year in England and twenty times the number of smoking related illnesses.

Quality is assessed by independent bodies such as the [[Healthcare Commission]] according to [[Standards for Better Health|standards]] set by the Department of Health and the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE).

They found that there was little evidence that any one country was moving ahead of the others consistently across the available indicators of performance. There had been improvements in all four countries in life expectancy and in rates of mortality amenable to health care.  Despite the hotly contested policy differences between the four countries there was little evidence, where there was comparable data, of any significant differences in outcomes.
