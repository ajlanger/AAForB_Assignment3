The parish includes the settlement of [[Well Hill]], and is {{convert|5|miles|km|0}} north of [[Sevenoaks]]. It included the settlement of [[Badgers Mount]] until April 2015, when Badgers Mount became a civil parish in its own right.\n\nThe probable derivation of the name is ''estate at the foot of a steep slope''. Steep slope was from the Saxon word ''scor''. pronounced ''shor'', but written ''sore'' by Norman scribes.\n\nThe village of Shoreham contains four traditional independent pubs: Ye Olde George Inne, The King's Arms, The Two Brewers and the Crown; with another in nearby Twitton.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Shoreham bridge.jpg|thumb|Shoreham bridge over the Darent]]\n\nThe Darent valley was one of the major areas of [[Stone Age]] settlement; Shoreham is not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]].\n\nIn 1668, [[cricket]] was mentioned in a court case as being played at Shoreham, one of the sport's earliest references.<ref>Underdown, pp. 12\u201313.</ref>\n\nIt was also known as a [[smuggling]] area.

In 2000, Shoreham Parish Council voted not to include his name on its war memorial.

It has been established that at least one of its fallen, George Arthur Rouse (brother of Percy Aslin, marked on the memorial, both sons of Harriet Rouse, as recorded in the 1901 Census), is missing. One hundred years after he died, an effort to have George added was underway.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Shoreham Aircraft Museum==\nThe official opening of the [[Shoreham Aircraft Museum]] in 1978 was attended by fifteen former [[Battle of Britain]] pilots. It pays lasting tribute to all those airmen who fought in the skies over southern England during [[World War II]] and houses a substantial collection of aviation relics excavated by the group over many years from sites of crashed British and German aircraft, as well as items which have been donated.\n\nRun by local enthusiasts, the Museum is largely funded by proceeds made by visitors whose donations contribute to the recovery and preservation of the artefacts.\nThe Battle of Britain brought the village of Shoreham directly into the war when on 15 September 1940, a [[Dornier Do 17]]Z, part of a force of about 100 German bombers approaching London, was shot down shortly before noon. The invading formation had been challenged by nine [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] squadrons and the battle developed into a series of individual 'dogfights'. The unfortunate pilot of the Dornier was forced to land in a field at Castle Farm, with a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] circling overhead, its cockpit canopy open, and its pilot waving a handkerchief, to signal a warning to the growing crowd of hop-pickers nearby to stay away until the Shoreham [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] arrived to recover the German crew. Feldwebel Heitsch, the pilot, and Feldwebel Pfeiffer, the observer, were driven to The Fox & Hounds pub in Knatts Valley, where they were bought a brandy before being driven to Sevenoaks Police Station. The museum holds a collection of photographs of the Dornier, along with items taken from the wreckage at the time.\n\n==Shoreham duck race==\n\n[[Image:ShorehamDuckRace.jpg|thumb|Shoreham duck race]]\nThe Duck Race is a long-running event in the village. It is held each year, on the May Day bank holiday. Entrants pay a small fee (usually \u00a31) to enter their 'duck' into the race. The duck has to travel along the river Darent from the war memorial in the village, to the bridge before the old Mill. A 'duck' can be anything from a shop-bought rubber duck to a model made by the entrant(s). Actual ducks are forbidden. It is a large event in the village and several hundred people turn out each year to line the riverbanks and watch. Anyone can enter and there is a prize for the 'Best Duck in Show' (awarded before the race begins) and the 'First placed Duck.' The money raised goes towards charitable organisations in the village.\n\n==Television==\nThe [[kitchen|''Showdown'' kitchen]] featured in ''[[The Big Family Cooking Showdown]]'' is a [[converted barn]] in Shoreham.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/zoe-ball-on-cooking-showdown-im-not-the-greatest-cook-486377/|title=''The Big Family Cooking Showdown'' kitchen}}</ref>\n\n==Notable events==\nOn 29 September 1934, [[Airspeed Courier]] G-ACSY of [[London, Scottish & Provincial Airways Ltd]] crashed [[1934 London, Scottish & Provincial Airways Airspeed Courier crash|just north of Shoreham]], at the bottom of Cockerhurst Road.<ref name=EDP20090604>{{cite news | url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/norfolk-life/air_crash_mystery_1_598760 | title=Air crash mystery | date=4 June 2009 | newspaper=Eastern Daily Press | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422184140/https://www.edp24.co.uk/norfolk-life/air_crash_mystery_1_598760 | archivedate=22 April 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The aircraft was on a scheduled international passenger flight from [[Heston Aerodrome|Heston]] to [[Le Bourget Airport|Paris]] and all four people on board were killed.\n\n==Notable people==\n(in alphabetical order)\n* [[Robert Ashington Bullen]] (1850\u20131912), geologist and authority on [[mollusca]], was the vicar from 1888 to 1896.\n* [[Verney Lovett Cameron]] (1844\u20131894), first European to cross Equatorial Africa from coast to coast, buried in the village graveyard.\n* [[Paul Chaloner]] (born 11 November 1971), professional esports broadcast host, also known as RedEye.\n* Robert Colgate, was a Shoreham farmer and a sympathiser with the [[French Revolution]] who, having been forced to leave Britain in 1793, travelled to the US where his son [[William Colgate]] founded the famous [[Colgate-Palmolive|Colgate]] company in 1806.\n* [[Goat]] (goat) \"baaa\".\n* [[Shena Mackay]] (author) though born in Edinburgh, grew up in Shoreham.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jul/10/books.guardianreview8 |title=Bohemian rhapsodist &#124; Books |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]] (1878\u20131957), the writer, lived here, at Dunstall Priory, serving in the Home Guard during World War II, and is buried here, with his wife\n* London-born artist [[Samuel Palmer]], (1805\u20131881) lived in the village from 1826 to 1835 where he was part of a group of artists who followed [[William Blake]] (there is a theory that Blake took his inspiration for 'Jerusalem' from the village's surroundings) and called themselves ''The Ancients''.
