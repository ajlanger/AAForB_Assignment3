It stars Covino, Marvin, [[Gayle Rankin]], [[Talia Balsam]], [[George Wendt]], and [[Judith Godr\u00e8che]].\n\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section on May 17, 2019. It is scheduled to be released on July 17, 2020, by [[Sony Pictures Classics]].\n\n==Plot==\nBest friends Mike and Kyle are biking together when Mike breaks the news to Kyle that he's currently sleeping with his fianc\u00e9. In the ensuing argument, Mike has a moment of road rage with a motorist that culminates into Mike getting assaulted after chasing the motorist down the road. At the hospital, where Mike is recovering from minor head wounds, Kyle's fianc\u00e9 visits Mike and is confronted by Kyle over her affair. After she tells him that she still loves him, he then asks if she still wants to get married.\n\nKyle's fianc\u00e9 goes on to marry Mike instead, but she unexpectedly dies shortly after. A visibly distraught Mike causes a scene at her funeral which is diffused by Kyle, who came to pay his respects. Mike admits to Kyle that what he did was wrong and that he's a terrible friend. Though Kyle is still angry at Mike, he still consoles him over his loss. Sometime later, Kyle, now in better physical shape, is working as a commercial-jingle writer and is dating his former high-school girlfriend, Marissa, with whom he is celebrating Thanksgiving with his family. Though his overprotective, overbearing mother is disapproving of the relationship, she is nonetheless happy for him when he announces his engagement with her. She then reveals to Kyle that she invited Mike to celebrate Christmas with them, noting his having no family of his own to celebrate with.\n\nOn Christmas night, a now overweight, alcoholic Mike arrives at Kyle's family's home. Finding his way into the garage, he comes across some old pictures of himself and his old helmet from when he played football in high school. Kyle's mother confronts Mike and tells him that he needs to make amends with Kyle for his selfish actions stop feeling sorry for himself over how he hurt him. Kyle then stumbles into the living room where he passes out drunk.\n\nSeeing Mike's worsened state, Kyle invites him to join him and Marissa on their vacation to a ski resort over New Years. After breaking his arm on a difficult slope, Mike is given permission by Kyle to stay with them for the night, the two of them getting drunk together and catching up on their pasts. A frustrated Marissa tells Kyle that Mike is a negative influence on his life and that he needs to cut him out from it. When Marissa goes to bed early, Kyle joins her in the hopes of having sex, but he quickly passes out before she returns from the bathroom. She then goes down to confront Mike about his behavior, and he attempts to kiss her. Though disgusted, she physically pressures him into following through with his advances, convinced that it will finally convince Kyle to break off their friendship for good.\n\nMike and Marissa's brother Ronnie plan a surprise ice-fishing bachelor party for Kyle before his impending wedding with Marissa. When Kyle momentarily steps away from the party, Mike approaches him and admits that he slept with Marissa. Kyle, angered once again, surprises Mike by saying that he no longer cares and simply wants to spend his life with someone who cares for him. Mike responds that Marissa doesn't actually care for Kyle as he is and wants to turn him into something she wants him to be, suggesting that he leaves her. At some point, Kyle breaks through a thin patch of ice in the frozen lake, though Mike manages to pull him out.\n\nKyle has since cut all ties with Mike, who is lonelier than ever. On the day of Kyle and Marissa's wedding, Mike crashes the ceremony and objects to their union, instigating a small brawl in the church between him and members of both Kyle and Marissa's families. During the confrontation, Marissa loudly declares that she's pregnant and that she's adamant about getting married. Upon learning this, the priest refuses to wed them over concerns that their child is pressuring them into a potentially doomed marriage and advises them to wait until after the child is born.\n\nAbout a year later, Mike is now working at a bicycle shop/caf\u00e9, where a now-married Kyle and Marissa visit him with their newly-born son, the former of whom still misses Mike.\n\nSeveral years later, Kyle and Marissa decide to divorce, presumably over Kyle's seeming refusal to remove Mike from his life. Kyle lives close to Marissa to stay in touch with their son and maintains his friendship with Mike, whom Kyle\u2019a son affectionately refers to as his \u201cuncle.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n* Michael Angelo Covino as Mike\n* Kyle Marvin as Kyle\n* [[Gayle Rankin]] as Marissa\n* [[Judith Godr\u00e8che]] as Ava\n* [[Talia Balsam]] as Suzi\n* [[George Wendt]] as Jim\n* Daniella Covino as Dani\n\n==Release==\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section on May 17, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/press/press-articles/communique/articles/the-screenings-guide-2019|title=The Screenings Guide 2019|date=May 9, 2019|accessdate=May 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/18/cannes-festival-2019-full-list-of-films |title=Cannes festival 2019: full list of films |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 18, 2019}}</ref> Shortly after, [[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/the-climb-movie-cycling-comedy-sony-classics-deal-cannes-1202622085/|title=Sony Classics Acquires Un Certain Regard Buddy Comedy \u2018The Climb\u2019 \u2013 Cannes|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=May 24, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> The film went onto screen at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 30, 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/08/telluride-film-festival-2019-lineup-ford-vs-ferrari-judy-full-list-of-movies-1202706577/|title=Telluride Film Festival: \u2018Ford V Ferrari\u2019, \u2018Judy\u2019, \u2018Motherless Brooklyn\u2019, Weinstein-Inspired Drama \u2018The Assistant\u2019 Among Premieres Headed to 46th Edition \u2013 Full List|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Pete|last=Hammond|date=August 29, 2019|accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref> The [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 6, 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/aeronauts-burnt-orange-heresy-join-tiff-2019-lineup-1231031|title='The Aeronauts,' 'Burnt Orange Heresy' Added to Toronto Film Fest Lineup|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Etan|last=Vlessing|date=August 13, 2019|accessdate=August 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tiff.net/events/the-climb|title=The Climb|website=[[Toronto International Film Festival]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> and the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 24, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sundance.org/projects/the-climb-3d1157ca-7585-4795-884c-945641173bac|title=The Climb|website=[[Sundance Film Festival]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIt was scheduled to be released on March 20, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/video/the-climb-trailer-cannes-feature-1202198306/|title=\u2018The Climb\u2019 Trailer: Cannes Breakout Kicks the Buddy Comedy Into a Hilarious New Gear \u2014 Exclusive|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Kate|last=Erbland|date=December 19, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> Previously, Sony Pictures Classics stated they would go ahead with the release of the film despite the [[COVID-19]] pandemic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2020/03/the-climb-interview-coronavirus-michael-covino-1202217527/|title=As Studios Postpone Big Theatrical Releases, \u2018The Climb\u2019 Sees Opportunity \u2014 For Now|website=IndieWire|first=Eric|last=Kohn|date=March 13, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> However, it was later pulled from the schedule, and re-dated to July 17, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/sony-pictures-classics-release-the-climb-postponed-in-wake-of-ny-la-theater-closures-1202884481/|title=Sony Pictures Classics\u2019 Release \u2018The Climb\u2019 Postponed In Wake Of NY & LA Theater Closures|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ERCboxoffice/status/1239931460519251968|title=Warm summer nights.
