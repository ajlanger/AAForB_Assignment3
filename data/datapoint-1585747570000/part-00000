It was originally intended to be a double album that included songs such as \"Johnny's Garden\", \"Love Story\", \"So Begins the Task\", \"The Treasure\", \"Colorado\", \"Fallen Eagle\", and \"Rock and Roll Crazies\". However, Atlantic executive [[Ahmet Ertegun]] insisted it be a single album.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|last=Zimmer, Dave, and Diltz, Henry|publisher=|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book| last = Zimmer| first = Dave| year = 2000| title = Crosby Stills and Nash: The Biography| location = | publisher = [[Da Capo Press]]| isbn = 978-0306809743| ref = harv| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/crosbystillsnash00zimm}}</ref>\n\nStills, was influenced by the recent success of bands with horn sections, including [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], and [[Blood, Sweat & Tears|Blood, Sweat, & Tears]], and introduced [[the Memphis Horns]] on this album and the tour to support, despite its negative reaction from fans.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThis was the first album he recorded at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami from February to March 1971 with [[the Albert Brothers]], who he used for the majority of his 1970s work.<ref name=\":1\" /> Ahmet Ertegun had suggested Miami as to get away from all the drama on the West Coast.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Uncut|first=|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young: Ultimate Music Guide|publisher=|year=2019|isbn=5010791106060|location=|pages=34\u201335}}</ref> Stills started work on the album while his first album had only just been released a month prior. This album was released only six months after his first album.\n\nIt was during this time that Stills would hold marathon recording sessions for three months while recording the album, employing two teams of studio engineers working shifts around the clock just to keep up with him. Jerry Garcia recalled Stills flew him to Miami for a week to record pedal steel on \"Change Partners\" saying \"I did sessions at the weirdest hours... the way he worked in the studio was totally crazy, but at the time he was really happening. He just accumulated endless tracks.\" Engineer Howard Albert recalled \"he turned up to his very first session at 2 am on the very night he landed in town.

There were numerous errors in the original printing of the lyrics, which necessitated that Atlantic issue the album with a large sticker affixed to the shrink wrap of the back cover with the corrections to the lyrics. Later editions of the album had corrected lyrics inside the gatefold and thus did not include a correction sticker on the album.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n\"Singin' Call\" which had been demoed for [[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]] was written about Rita Coolidge.<ref name=\":3\" /> Stills was inspired to write \"Word Game\" after watching a documentary film about apartheid and musically influenced by Bob Dylan's \"It's Alright Ma (Im Only Bleeding).<ref name=\":3\" />\" Fishes and Scorpions\" which featured Stills and Eric Clapton on guitars was recorded during the recording sessions for his first album.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nHe had already performed \"Bluebird Revisited\" on tour with [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young]] in 1969 including at Woodstock.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStills undertook a 52 date tour called The Memphis Horns Tour in the summer of 1971 to support this album; members included [[the Memphis Horns]] along with CSNY bass player Calvin Samuels and CSNY drummer [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]]. The tour encompassed a variety of formats and moods from solo acoustic confessionals and folk duets to rock anthems and big band R&B. The tour was not very well received due to Stills' lack of confidence. The opening night in Seattle only 3,000 people appearing out 15,000 as the Boeing factory had just closed. With this fact and his recent split from Coolidge severely knocking his confidence Stills, started drinking hence the tour's nickname \"the Drunken Horns Tour\". However, Stills has also said there were good nights like the night he sold out [[Madison Square Garden]]. Though this was overshadowed by [[The Concert for Bangladesh|The Concert For Bangladesh]] just a day later, which Stills had donated his stage, sound, lighting system and production manager and was not even invited to play.<ref name=\":1\" /> Also a roadie died on stage after plummeting from the rigging at MSG, then a few a days later Stills fell of a motorcycle and finished the tour in a brace requiring David Crosby to help him finish the last few dates of the tour.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Doggett|first=Peter|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young: The Biography|publisher=|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Stills had been promising a massive tour since his first album saying it would be 'a real road show - the biggest since Ray Charles hit the stage', however early on in the tour he commented saying it was a marathon where you watch the singer bleed trying to sing 18 songs in a row\". Due to these issues Stills has a negative reception of the tour.<ref name=\":4\" /> It was during this tour that Stills met with [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]]' [[Chris Hillman]] and the beginnings of [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]] took place.\n\nHe later re-recorded two songs from this collection: \"Singin' Call\" for his 1991 album ''[[Stills Alone]]''; and \"Word Game\" for his 2013 album with blues supergroup [[The Rides]]. He also reworked the song \"Know You Got to Run\", adding on a chorus to change it into \"Open Up\", a tune which he never recorded himself, but instead gave to [[REO Speedwagon]], who recorded it for their album ''[[Ridin' the Storm Out]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nBy 1974, the album had sold an estimated 600,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-reunion-of-crosby-stills-nash-young-the-ego-meets-the-dove-179262/|title=The Reunion of Crosby Stills Nash & Young|last=Fong-Torres|first=Ben|last2=Fong-Torres|first2=Ben|date=1974-08-29|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic |class=album |tab=review |id=r19141 |first=James |last=Chrispell |accessdate={{date|2006-09-03}} |ref=Allmusic}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev2Score = C<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: S|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=S&bk=70|accessdate=March 13, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com|title-link=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev3Score = C<ref name=\"Christgau\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=October 14, 1971|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg20.php|title=Consumer Guide (19)|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York City|accessdate=April 14, 2013}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin|title=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|year=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=4th|isbn=978-0195313734|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref>\n}}\nContemporary reception was mixed to positive with [[John Mendelsohn (musician)|John Mendelsohn]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' describing Stills as \"a solid second-rate artist who so many lower-middlebrows insist on believing is actually first-rate\" and his post-Buffalo Springfield work collectively as \"fifth-rate self-indulgence\".

We didn't know he was coming and we were in the middle of making a [[Live Johnny Winter And|Johnny Winter]] album. Lucky for us, there were two of us because Stephen wanted to start straight away\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Content ==\nThe lyrics were printed on the inside of the gatefold cover in red, on a background photograph of Stephen Stills in a mountainous outdoor setting pointing into the distance. There were numerous errors in the original printing of the lyrics, which necessitated that Atlantic issue the album with a large sticker affixed to the shrink wrap of the back cover with the corrections to the lyrics. Later editions of the album had corrected lyrics inside the gatefold and thus did not include a correction sticker on the album.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n\"Singin' Call\" which had been demoed for [[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]] was written about Rita Coolidge.<ref name=\":3\" /> Stills was inspired to write \"Word Game\" after watching a documentary film about apartheid and musically influenced by Bob Dylan's \"It's Alright Ma (Im Only Bleeding).<ref name=\":3\" />\" Fishes and Scorpions\" which featured Stills and Eric Clapton on guitars was recorded during the recording sessions for his first album.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nHe had already performed \"Bluebird Revisited\" on tour with [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young]] in 1969 including at Woodstock.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nStills undertook a 52 date tour called The Memphis Horns Tour in the summer of 1971 to support this album; members included [[the Memphis Horns]] along with CSNY bass player Calvin Samuels and CSNY drummer [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]]. The tour encompassed a variety of formats and moods from solo acoustic confessionals and folk duets to rock anthems and big band R&B. The tour was not very well received due to Stills' lack of confidence. The opening night in Seattle only 3,000 people appearing out 15,000 as the Boeing factory had just closed. With this fact and his recent split from Coolidge severely knocking his confidence Stills, started drinking hence the tour's nickname \"the Drunken Horns Tour\". However, Stills has also said there were good nights like the night he sold out [[Madison Square Garden]]. Though this was overshadowed by [[The Concert for Bangladesh|The Concert For Bangladesh]] just a day later, which Stills had donated his stage, sound, lighting system and production manager and was not even invited to play.<ref name=\":1\" /> Also a roadie died on stage after plummeting from the rigging at MSG, then a few a days later Stills fell of a motorcycle and finished the tour in a brace requiring David Crosby to help him finish the last few dates of the tour.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Doggett|first=Peter|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young: The Biography|publisher=|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Stills had been promising a massive tour since his first album saying it would be 'a real road show - the biggest since Ray Charles hit the stage', however early on in the tour he commented saying it was a marathon where you watch the singer bleed trying to sing 18 songs in a row\". Due to these issues Stills has a negative reception of the tour.<ref name=\":4\" /> It was during this tour that Stills met with [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]]' [[Chris Hillman]] and the beginnings of [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]] took place.  \n\nHe later re-recorded two songs from this collection: \"Singin' Call\" for his 1991 album ''[[Stills Alone]]''; and \"Word Game\" for his 2013 album with blues supergroup [[The Rides]]. He also reworked the song \"Know You Got to Run\", adding on a chorus to change it into \"Open Up\", a tune which he never recorded himself, but instead gave to [[REO Speedwagon]], who recorded it for their album ''[[Ridin' the Storm Out]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nBy 1974, the album had sold an estimated 600,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-reunion-of-crosby-stills-nash-young-the-ego-meets-the-dove-179262/|title=The Reunion of Crosby Stills Nash & Young|last=Fong-Torres|first=Ben|last2=Fong-Torres|first2=Ben|date=1974-08-29|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic |class=album |tab=review |id=r19141 |first=James |last=Chrispell |accessdate={{date|2006-09-03}} |ref=Allmusic}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev2Score = C<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: S|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=S&bk=70|accessdate=March 13, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com|title-link=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev3Score = C<ref name=\"Christgau\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=October 14, 1971|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg20.php|title=Consumer Guide (19)|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York City|accessdate=April 14, 2013}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin|title=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|year=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=4th|isbn=978-0195313734|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref>\n}}\nContemporary reception was mixed to positive with [[John Mendelsohn (musician)|John Mendelsohn]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' describing Stills as \"a solid second-rate artist who so many lower-middlebrows insist on believing is actually first-rate\" and his post-Buffalo Springfield work collectively as \"fifth-rate self-indulgence\".

Unfortunately, he's never quite communicated all this on a record, but now he's approaching his true level. Flashes of brilliant ease remain--the single, \"Marianne,\" is very nice, especially if you don't listen too hard to the lyrics--but there's also a lot of stuff on the order of an all-male chorus with jazzy horns singing \"It's disgusting\" in perfect tuneful unison, and straight, I swear.
