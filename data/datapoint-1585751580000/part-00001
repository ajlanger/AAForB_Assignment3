However, during the process of this battle, Spain passed the [[New Laws]] that said that every slave in New Spain was free.<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|138\u2013145}}\n\n==Return to Mexico==\nIn September 1562, after a terrible voyage, Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s arrived into the port of San Francisco de Campeche.<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|124}} At the end of January 1562, Cort\u00e9s and his two half brothers, the other Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s and Luis Cort\u00e9s, sailed toward Vera Cruz, the city their father had founded a mere 44&nbsp;years prior. By February, the Cort\u00e9s brothers had reached their parents' former home and the birthplace of Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, son of Malinche, [[Tenochtitl\u00e1n]]. Being the heir of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, don Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s Zu\u00f1iga (the legitimate son, not the son of Malinche) was now the [[Marquis]] of the Valley of Oaxaca.\n\nIn 1566, news arrived to Mexico that the ''leyes de encomienda'' or [[encomienda]] laws that changed the ''encomienda'' system that said at the death of the ''encomendero'', all his properties would belong to the government and not the family of the deceased.<ref name=Simpson>Byrd Simpson, Lesley (1982) ''The Encomienda in New Spain: The Beginning of Spanish Mexico''. p. 199 Berkley: University of California Press</ref> In March 1566, Brothers Gil and Alonso de \u00c1vila held a party at their home in Mexico. This was the spot where what would become known as the \"marquis plot\" supposedly occurred.<ref name=Cortes/>{{rp|Ixx}} The brothers had dressed as Mexican [[chieftain]]s and paid homage to someone dressed as Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. To the Cort\u00e9s brothers and their friends, this was simply a [[Hoax|charade]]. However, the Spanish court in New Spain saw it as their attempt to overthrow them.\n\nThe [[Treasury|Real Hacienda]] denounced the acts to the [[Viceroy]] as a direct attack upon King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], and the conspirators were arrested. Amongst those arrested were Cort\u00e9s's three sons. Several members of the [[List of conspiracies (political)|conspiracy]] were [[capital punishment|executed]]. A few days later, the Viceroy [[Gast\u00f3n de Peralta, 3rd Marquis of Falces|Gast\u00f3n de Peralta]] intervened directly and released Cort\u00e9s's three sons.<ref>Pereyra, Carlos<!--Don't link to Argentine boxer of same name.--> (1956), ''Historia del pueblo mexicano'' vol.

He learned that his brothers, the \u00c1vila brothers, and eighteen other friends had been taken prisoner too. They were being charged with plotting to anoint the marqu\u00e9s, his brother don Mart\u00edn, as the king of New Spain.<ref name=Cortes/>{{rp|XIii}} He was brought before the [[judge]] on the day of his arrest, three days after having been questioned, he sent the judge a petition asking him to either charge him with something or let him go, but nothing happened. Six days later, he tried again, and once again, nothing happened. Finally, thirteen days later, he was charged with having known for ten or eleven months that his brother and other people in his close circle were charged with planning a [[rebellion]] and uprising against His Majesty. Alfonso de \u00c1vila and his brother were both publicly beheaded, and in September 1566, the first Cort\u00e9s brother, Luis, was sentenced to death by [[Decapitation|beheading]].<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|172\u2013179}}\n\nHowever, before this could happen, a new viceroy, the Marqu\u00e9s de Falces, arrived in Vera Cruz on November 15, 1567. He allowed both of Mart\u00edn\u2019s brothers to leave New Spain and for Luis to go serve time in a colony near [[Algeria]] while Martin was allowed to plead his case before the king. However, Mart\u00edn, Malinche's son, stayed in Mexico.<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|189\u2013212}}\n\nOn January 7, 1568, Mart\u00edn was subjected to torture and was sentenced to indefinite exile in Spain. His torturer was reproached by King Philip II personally, sent back to Spain, and found dead in his room one day after having met with the king.<ref name=\"P2\">Pereyra, Carlos<!--Don't link to Argentine boxer of same name.--> (1956), ''Historia del pueblo mexicano'' vol.

They had two children: a daughter, Ana Cort\u00e9s, and a son, Fernando Cort\u00e9s.<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|114}} Details and dates of Mart\u00edn's family life do not exist. It is also not entirely clear when Mart\u00edn died. He died in Spain sometime before the turn of the seventeenth century; 1595 has been mentioned as a possible date. In 1574, the king offered condolences to the children of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and they were all exonerated of any wrongdoing.<ref name=\"Rodr\u00edguez\">[[Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez Rodr\u00edguez|Mart\u00ednez, Jos\u00e9 Luis]] (1992), ''Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s'', p. 360\u2013363, M\u00e9xico, ed.
