It is a sequel to 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the seventh mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the twelfth entry in the franchise overall. The film is written and directed by [[Simon Kinberg]] (in his feature directorial debut) and stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring <!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->[[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], and [[Jessica Chastain]]<!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->. In ''Dark Phoenix'', the X-Men are forced to face the full power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] after a mission in space goes wrong.\n\nAfter ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) erased the events of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) from the [[X-Men (film series)|series']] timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" in a future film that would be more faithful than his previous attempt with ''The Last Stand'', which was not well received, and even he and writer [[Zak Penn]] were equally unhappy with how it turned out. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to ''Apocalypse'' in 2016. Kinberg signed on to make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in June 2017, when the majority of the cast was set to return from ''Apocalypse''. Filming began later that month in [[Montreal]] and was completed in October 2017; the entire third act was later reshot in late 2018, following poor test screenings. The film was dedicated to the memory of ''X-Men'' co-creator [[Stan Lee]], who died in 2018.\n\n''Dark Phoenix'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $252{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a $200-million budget and became the lowest-grossing installment in the series. It also received generally unfavorable reviews from critics with various critical takes; many viewed it as a disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to Fox's ''X-Men'' series although the performances of the cast and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised.<ref name=\"Reviews1\" /><ref name=\"Reviews2\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, eight-year-old [[Jean Grey]] and her parents get into a car accident that kills her mother. Shortly afterward, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] takes her to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] because her father was afraid of her.\n\nIn 1992, the [[X-Men]] respond to a distress signal from the [[Space Shuttle|space shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], which is critically damaged by solar flare-like energy during the [[STS-49]] mission. While they save the astronauts, Jean is stranded and struck by the energy which she absorbs into her body to save her team's aircraft from destruction. She survives the event, and her psychic powers are greatly amplified as a result, but they become uncontrollable, and she accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory at Xavier's school. Xavier had placed mental walls in Jean's mind as a girl to protect her psychic mind from experiencing trauma; these are destroyed by Jean's enhanced power, and the trauma slowly returns, resulting in her being full of rage and pain. She travels to her childhood hometown after finding out that her father is still alive and learns that he abandoned her. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and remembers that she had inadvertently caused it rendering her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy, which causes her to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The X-Men arrive and attempt to take Jean home, but she uses her power against [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], injuring the former and killing the latter, before fleeing.\n\nJean travels to the mutant refugee island of [[Genosha]] to seek assistance from [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] in controlling her rage but is turned away by him after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Jean meets Vuk, the leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]]. She explains to Jean that she has bonded with [[Phoenix Force (comics)|a force of cosmic power]] that wiped out the D'Bari home planet long ago. The power had consumed all those it came across until it was drawn to Jean. Meanwhile, [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], mad with grief by Raven's death, allies with Erik and the mutant refugees in an attempt to kill Jean in [[New York City]].\n\nUpon learning of Erik's plan, the X-Men try to stop him and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|his faction of mutants]]. As they battle, Erik manages to enter the building and confront Jean, only to fall to her amplified powers. Xavier then enters the building with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]]. Jean attacks them until Xavier convinces her to read his memories &ndash; allowing her personality to resurface. Feeling remorseful, Jean offers to let Vuk take the force from her; however, it is revealed that doing so would kill Jean, as well as revealing that Vuk also intends to use the force to conquer Earth. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] are able to prevent Vuk from fully absorbing the force from Jean, though Jean loses consciousness from the ordeal. Troops sent by the U.S. government, who use stun weapons and power-inhibiting collars, attack and subdue both mutant factions, who are placed on a train headed towards a containment facility.\n\nOn the train, Xavier admits to Hank that the latter was right in his earlier accusations of violating Jean's mind. The train is attacked by Vuk and her D'Bari forces. When the soldiers are overpowered by the shape-shifters, the mutants are freed from their restraints to combat the threat. The mutants deal with most of the D'Bari attackers, but Vuk arrives and heads for Jean, defeating each mutant who attempts to stop her. Xavier confers with Jean within his mind, allowing Jean to gain control of her power. After forgiving Xavier, Jean saves the mutants from Vuk's attacks and the ensuing train wreck before proceeding to disintegrate the remaining D'Bari when they attack her. Vuk once again attempts to drain Jean of the force, but Jean takes Vuk into outer space, retakes the power that Vuk had received earlier, and then kills her. Jean then disappears in a burst of energy in the form of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Xavier's school is renamed the \"Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters\", and Hank becomes their new dean with Xavier having retired. While settling himself in [[Paris]], Xavier is reunited with Erik and agrees to play a game of chess with him. As they start playing, a flaming phoenix appears in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Dark Phoenix cast.jpg|140|1150|The cast of ''Dark Phoenix'' promoting the film at the 2019 [[WonderCon]].

Many of the characters in the film turn against Xavier as some of his decisions regarding Jean Grey's abilities are revealed. Director [[Simon Kinberg]] felt that the character always acts out of concern for the \"greater good,\" though he may make some \"misguided\" choices at times. Kinberg hoped that each character would come across as having \"a valid point of view\" in the film.<ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" />\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: <br />Quicksilver's father and a powerful mutant who can control [[magnetic field]]s and manipulate metal, he is Xavier's former best friend and often rival. Magneto has formed a community of mutant refugees on the island of [[Genosha]],<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> which Kinberg compared to [[Israel]] in it being a homeland where mutants can be safe.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven / Mystique]]: <br />A shape-shifting mutant and Xavier's adopted sister. Lawrence described her role in the film as more maternal than before, as she leads the younger X-Men.<ref name=\"EWLawrence\" /> The film continues growing the schism between Mystique and Xavier, with Mystique not approving of some of Xavier's methods, though Kinberg hoped that this would be more subtle in ''Dark Phoenix'' than in previous ''X-Men'' films. The film also sees the character change between appearing as Raven and Mystique more than previously, with each change having a specific meaning to the character and story.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> She continues to have feelings for Beast.\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy / Beast]]: <br />A mutant with a beastly appearance and superhuman physical abilities. He is a teacher at Xavier's School and helps lead the younger X-Men. He continues to have feelings for Mystique.\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Jean Grey]] / [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]: <br />An extremely powerful mutant with telepathic and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers who is one of Xavier's most prized students. The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix entity]] is unleashed in the film, leading to a fight between the two personalities for control. Turner studied [[dissociative identity disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]] for the role, particularly for scenes where she has to change from the vulnerable Jean to the confident Phoenix.<ref name=\"EWTurner\" /> Kinberg said Turner has the lead role in the film, a first for the actress.<ref name=\"ChastainTHR\" /> Summer Fontana portrays a young Jean Grey.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers / Cyclops]]: <br />A mutant who fires concussive optic beams. The film develops his relationship with Jean Grey, which Kinberg called \"a huge part of the emotional core of the movie.\" This forces the character to become a leader in the film,<ref name=\"JeanScott\" /> as he is the most prominent character who holds on to hope as Jean grows more unstable.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Alexandra Shipp]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: <br />An African mutant who can control the weather.\n* [[Evan Peters]] as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver]]: <br />Magneto's mutant son who can move at [[Speedster (fiction)|superhuman speed]]. Peters described the character as more mature and subdued in the film, being focused on using his abilities for good as a member of the X-Men.<ref name=\"PetersSRMay2018\" />\n* [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] as [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler]]: <br />A German mutant who can teleport.\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Vuk:<br />The leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]] who manipulates the Phoenix. Kinberg described her as \"the devil on Jean's shoulder,\"<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> while Chastain called her character \"clinical.\"<ref name=\"EWChastain\" /> Chastain also plays Margaret Smith, the woman Vuk impersonates.\n* [[Scott Shepherd (actor)|Scott Shepherd]] as John Grey\n* [[Ato Essandoh]] as Jones, Vuk's second in command.\n* [[Brian d'Arcy James]] as the [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Halston Sage]] as [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] in the character's first cinematic appearance.<ref name=\"40Years\" />\n* [[Lamar Johnson (actor)|Lamar Johnson]] as [[Match (Marvel Comics)|Match]]\n\nAdditionally, Kota Eberhardt portrays telepath [[Selene (comics)|Selene Gallio]], while [[Andrew Stehlin]] portrays Ariki, a mutant who can utilize his hair braids as a weapon. Hannah Anderson portrays Jean's mother, Elaine.

The studio chose to adapt the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" as only one of the film's \"parallel storylines\", with an executive at [[20th Century Fox]] suggesting that the \"[[Gifted (comics)|Gifted]]\" storyline also be in that film.<ref name=\"KinbergX3\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/04/15/interview-zak-penn-on-the-grand-x-men-fans-and-co-writing-hulk/ |title=INTERVIEW: ZAK PENN ON THE GRAND, X-MEN FANS AND CO-WRITING HULK |access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> This version of the story was not well received by fans and critics. Kinberg stated that he and Penn were ultimately unhappy with how the adaptation turned out as well.<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" />\n\nAfter the timeline of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' franchise]] was [[retconned]] with the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', it was noted that a new adaptation of the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" could be made that ignores the events of ''The Last Stand''. Kinberg and Singer both expressed interest in the prospect, and hinted that 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' would set up elements for a retelling. ''Apocalypse'' introduces [[Sophie Turner]] as a young Jean Grey, and begins exploring \"how powerful she is.\"<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" /> By April 2016, the sequel to ''Apocalypse'' was believed to indeed re-adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga.\"<ref name=\"HHApr2016\" /> In May 2016, Kinberg said that the next ''X-Men'' film after ''Apocalypse'' would be set in the 1990s, advancing one decade, as had been done for each of the previous few ''X-Men'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2016\" /> He also noted that ''Apocalypse'' had introduced younger versions of several characters from the original ''X-Men'' films to give them a new [[origin story]]\u2014including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Jean Grey\u2014with the intention of then exploring them in their own line of films. He added that he also hoped to see the cast of the previous trilogy of films return, namely [[James McAvoy]] as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], [[Michael Fassbender]] as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkh\u00f6lme / Mystique]].<ref name=\"CastHopes\" />\n\nIn July, Kinberg said he would begin writing the next mainline ''X-Men'' film \"real soon\".<ref name=\"KinbergJul2016\" /> That November, Fox was said to be pressing \"the reset button\" on the franchise due to the financial and critical under-performance of ''Apocalypse'', with the franchise being reconfigured and Singer not returning to direct the next film. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, and [[Nicholas Hoult]]'s contracts from the previous trilogy had ended, but Kinberg was optimistically writing the new script with them in mind.<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> It was rumored in February 2017 that the next film would be titled ''X-Men: Supernova'', and would begin filming that June.<ref name=\"Supernova\" /> Also in February, Turner confirmed that she would return for the film.<ref name=\"TurnerFeb2017\" /> Kinberg was believed to be interested in making his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with the film,<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb2017\" /> and was described as the top contender for the job with interest from Fox. The studio was also looking to negotiate new deals with Lawrence, Fassbender, McAvoy, and Hoult to return.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20172\" /> By the end of the month, Kinberg described reports that he may direct the film as \"premature,\" but added that if he were to direct, he would not be daunted by the scale of the film due to his experience writing and producing many of the other ''X-Men'' films. He also reiterated that he would adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" differently to how it was for ''The Last Stand'' if given another opportunity to do so.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20173\" />\n\n===Writing and original two-part plan===\n\nSimon Kinberg wanted a two-film story, as hinted by Olivia Munn in an interview with Collider in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/olivia-munn-interview-lego-ninjago-movie-x-men-dark-phoenix/|title=Olivia Munn on 'The LEGO Ninjago Movie' & Returning for 'X-Men: Dark Phoenix'|first=Christina|last=Radish|date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' later confirmed this initial approach.

He felt that this would give more impact to the large-scale elements of the film, and help it be more emotional, comparing this idea to the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on June 28, 2017, in [[Montreal]], Quebec,<ref name=\"FormalizedPlans\" /><ref name=\"ACTRAFilming\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Teen Spirit''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Mauro Fiore]] served as cinematographer.<ref name=\"Fiore\" /> Filming primarily took place at MELS Studios.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> Before the end of the month, [[Evan Peters]] was set to reprise his role as \"audience favorite\" character [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] from the previous films, and [[Lamar Johnson (actor)|Lamar Johnson]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"PetersJohnson\" /> At the start of August, Chastain confirmed her involvement in the film;<ref name=\"ChastainConfirmed\" /> she was interested in the story, after turning down roles in other superhero films, due to its focus on female characters.<ref name=\"XWomen\" /> Kinberg said he wanted the film to be \"human\" and emotional like previous ''X-Men'' films, and that he was looking to ground the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" story for his adaptation \"so it's not too intergalactic.\"<ref name=\"KinbergTFAug2017\" /> He later clarified that the film would still include alien characters as in the comic storyline, an element that was ignored for the ''Last Stand'' adaptation but which he felt was integral to the story.<ref name=\"KinbergETMay2018\" /><ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" /> He also said that the film would tonally be less operatic than previous ''X-Men'' films, which he hoped would make it more relatable for audiences.<ref name=\"KinbergETMay2018\" /> By September, [[Daniel Cudmore]] had stated that he would be appearing in the film, but could not confirm whether he would be reprising his role as [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] from previous films in the franchise.<ref name=\"CudmoreSep2017\" /> Chastain revealed that she was not actually playing Lilandra.<ref name=\"NoLilandra\" /> While [[Olivia Munn]] had initially said that she would reprise her role as [[Psylocke]]<!-- , and described ''Dark Phoenix'' as \"a two parter\" -->,<ref name=\"Munn\" /> by February 2019, she revealed that she was unable to reprise her role due to scheduling conflicts with filming ''[[The Predator (film)|The Predator]]''.<ref name=\"NoPsylocke\" /> Filming was completed on October 14, 2017.<ref name=\"ACTRAFilming\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn December 2017, Kinberg revealed that the film would be in post-production for almost a year, longer than usual for the series, because he wanted to take the time to have the visual effects look right by focusing on the \"nuance\" of the effects rather than the scale.<ref name=\"EWVisuals\" /> He also explained that he \"felt in his gut\" that this was the story that he needed to tell once Singer left the franchise, and that his vision for the film was \"so clear in my head, emotionally and visually, that it would have killed me to hand this to somebody else to direct.\" The film was described as being the most sinister and somber of the franchise, with McAvoy finding it to be the most emotional of the ''X-Men'' films he had worked on. It becomes a \"fight for Jean's soul\" and features a twist that was intended to have significant repercussions on the entire franchise.<ref name=\"EWCover\" /> Lawrence revealed that she had worked to convince Kinberg to direct the film, and had promised to return for it if he did so, despite her dislike of the make-up required to portray her character.<ref name=\"EWLawrence2\" /> It was also revealed then that the film would introduce a version of the island [[Genosha]], adapted to the film as a mutant refuge led by Magneto;<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> and that it would focus on the female characters more so than previous films in the series, particularly Jean Grey as both the protagonist and antagonist of the film, and Chastain's character, with whom Grey has a complex relationship.<ref name=\"XWomen\" />\n\nFox delayed the film's release in March 2018, pushing it back from November 2, 2018 to February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This was because Fox and Kinberg wanted to schedule some routine reshoots for the film after receiving feedback from audiences during a test screening, but were not able to get all of the necessary cast members together until August or September 2018. This would not have left enough time to complete post-production work such as visual effects for the additional footage before the November 2018 release date.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> Specifically, Kinberg was looking to rework the third act of the film, and re-wrote part of the script ahead of the reshoots. With post-production already underway, the film was believed to have been under-budget, while the planned reshoots would cost less than $10{{nbsp}}million. Additionally, Kinberg and the studio had been looking to change the film's release date for \"some time\" to avoid competing with the Christmas-oriented film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. The new February release date was noted as having the film opening away from other major studio films, while placing it on [[President's Day]] weekend, which had proved to be successful for ''Deadpool'' and Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"THRReshoots\" /> Addressing the reshoots, Kinberg confirmed the scheduling delays, and described the photography as a \"normal\" part of the film's creation that would allow him \"enough time to have it ready and looking perfect.\"<ref name=\"KinbergReshoots\" />\n\nAt the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include \"''X-Men''\" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in ''Dark Phoenix'' which was compared to the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' logo;<ref name=\"FirstLogo\" /> the film was later confirmed to be simply titled ''Dark Phoenix'' in the United States, and ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' for release internationally.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /><ref name=\"ColliderReshootsAug2018\" /> The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand\u00e9 studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period,<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> and had begun by August 31.<ref name=\"ReshootsBegin\" /> At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that had previously been reserved for Fox's newly-delayed and later canceled ''[[Gambit (unproduced film)|Gambit]]'' film.<ref name=\"Sep2018ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"DisneyMay2019ScheduleUpdate\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/gambit-movie-dead/ |title=\u2018Gambit\u2019 Is Dead; Disney Drops the X-Men Spinoff from the Schedule |website=[[Collider]] |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |date=May 7, 2019 |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/78CX9lkfJ |archive-date=May 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The move was also reportedly to appease [[James Cameron]], who had ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' moved from December to February and did not want competition from another Fox would-be blockbuster; Kinberg and ''Dark Phoenix'' producers opposed the change as the film was not made for a summer and was facing heavy competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"We Were Wrong\": Behind Fox's ''Dark Phoenix'' Debacle |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/we-were-wrong-behind-dark-phoenix-foxs-dismal-x-men-franchise-finale-plans-1216859 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Lana Condor]] revealed that she was unable to return as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] due to her commitment to the film ''[[To All the Boys I've Loved Before (film)|To All the Boys I've Loved Before]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"CondorCollider\" /> [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]] serves as editor for the film.<ref name=\"EditorSmith\" /> Visual effects were provided by [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], MELS, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Soho VFX, with Phil Brennan serving as the main visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VisualEffects\" />\n\n==Music==\nEvan Peters stated in January 2018 that [[Hans Zimmer]] was composing the score for the film,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /> despite Zimmer having said in March 2016 that he would not score another superhero film following his experience working on ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"ZimmerNoSupers\" /> Zimmer later explained that in conversations with director [[Ron Howard]] he was convinced to not keep a \"blanket\" view, and to focus on waiting for the right story rather than avoiding an entire genre. When Kinberg approached him at a concert to talk about his vision for ''Dark Phoenix'', Zimmer realized that the story was one that he wanted to help tell, and that the film was an opportunity for something that he had always wanted to try in a film score; he decided to join the production.<ref name=\"ZimmerExplanation\" /> In writing the film's score, Zimmer wrote new themes for the X-Men, Magneto, and the Phoenix, and chose to omit previously established themes written by previous composer [[John Ottman]].\n\nOn May 23, 2019, the track \"Extraordinary Being\" by [[Emeli Sand\u00e9]] was released as the official soundtrack.<ref>{{Cite AV Media |last=EmeliSandeVEVO |title=Emeli Sand\u00e9 - Extraordinary Being \u2013 In Collaboration with X-Men: Dark Phoenix |date=May 23, 2019 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnYsk7jfUTE |via= [[YouTube]] |access-date=May 27, 2019}}</ref> The soundtrack was released digitally on June 7.

and later released on home media as '''''X-Men: Dark Phoenix''''') is a 2019 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[X-Men]] characters. It is a sequel to 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the seventh mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the twelfth entry in the franchise overall. The film is written and directed by [[Simon Kinberg]] (in his feature directorial debut) and stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring <!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->[[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], and [[Jessica Chastain]]<!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->. In ''Dark Phoenix'', the X-Men are forced to face the full power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] after a mission in space goes wrong.\n\nAfter ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) erased the events of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) from the [[X-Men (film series)|series']] timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" in a future film that would be more faithful than his previous attempt with ''The Last Stand'', which was not well received even he & writer [[Zak Penn]] were equally unhappy with how it turned out. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to ''Apocalypse'' in 2016. Kinberg signed on to make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in June 2017, when the majority of the cast was set to return from ''Apocalypse''. Filming began later that month in [[Montreal]] and was completed in October 2017; the entire third act was later reshot in late 2018, following poor test screenings. The film was dedicated to the memory of ''X-Men'' co-creator [[Stan Lee]], who died in 2018.\n\n''Dark Phoenix'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $252{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a $200-million budget and became the lowest-grossing installment in the series. It also received generally unfavorable reviews from critics with various critical takes; many viewed it as a disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to Fox's ''X-Men'' series although the performances of the cast and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised.<ref name=\"Reviews1\" /><ref name=\"Reviews2\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, eight-year-old [[Jean Grey]] and her parents get into a car accident that kills her mother. Shortly afterward, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] takes her to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] because her father was afraid of her.\n\nIn 1992, the [[X-Men]] respond to a distress signal from the [[Space Shuttle|space shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], which is critically damaged by solar flare-like energy during the [[STS-49]] mission. While they save the astronauts, Jean is stranded and struck by the energy which she absorbs into her body to save her team's aircraft from destruction. She survives the event, and her psychic powers are greatly amplified as a result, but they become uncontrollable, and she accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory at Xavier's school. Xavier had placed mental walls in Jean's mind as a girl to protect her psychic mind from experiencing trauma; these are destroyed by Jean's enhanced power, and the trauma slowly returns, resulting in her being full of rage and pain. She travels to her childhood hometown after finding out that her father is still alive and learns that he abandoned her. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and remembers that she had inadvertently caused it rendering her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy, which causes her to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The X-Men arrive and attempt to take Jean home, but she uses her power against [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], injuring the former and killing the latter, before fleeing.\n\nJean travels to the mutant refugee island of [[Genosha]] to seek assistance from [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] in controlling her rage but is turned away by him after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Jean meets Vuk, the leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]]. She explains to Jean that she has bonded with [[Phoenix Force (comics)|a force of cosmic power]] that wiped out the D'Bari home planet long ago. The power had consumed all those it came across until it was drawn to Jean. Meanwhile, [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], mad with grief by Raven's death, allies with Erik and the mutant refugees in an attempt to kill Jean in [[New York City]].\n\nUpon learning of Erik's plan, the X-Men try to stop him and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|his faction of mutants]]. As they battle, Erik manages to enter the building and confront Jean, only to fall to her amplified powers. Xavier then enters the building with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]]. Jean attacks them until Xavier convinces her to read his memories &ndash; allowing her personality to resurface. Feeling remorseful, Jean offers to let Vuk take the force from her; however, it is revealed that doing so would kill Jean, as well as revealing that Vuk also intends to use the force to conquer Earth. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] are able to prevent Vuk from fully absorbing the force from Jean, though Jean loses consciousness from the ordeal. Troops sent by the U.S. government, who use stun weapons and power-inhibiting collars, attack and subdue both mutant factions, who are placed on a train headed towards a containment facility.\n\nOn the train, Xavier admits to Hank that the latter was right in his earlier accusations of violating Jean's mind. The train is attacked by Vuk and her D'Bari forces. When the soldiers are overpowered by the shape-shifters, the mutants are freed from their restraints to combat the threat. The mutants deal with most of the D'Bari attackers, but Vuk arrives and heads for Jean, defeating each mutant who attempts to stop her. Xavier confers with Jean within his mind, allowing Jean to gain control of her power. After forgiving Xavier, Jean saves the mutants from Vuk's attacks and the ensuing train wreck before proceeding to disintegrate the remaining D'Bari when they attack her. Vuk once again attempts to drain Jean of the force, but Jean takes Vuk into outer space, retakes the power that Vuk had received earlier, and then kills her. Jean then disappears in a burst of energy in the form of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Xavier's school is renamed the \"Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters\", and Hank becomes their new dean with Xavier having retired. While settling himself in [[Paris]], Xavier is reunited with Erik and agrees to play a game of chess with him. As they start playing, a flaming phoenix appears in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Dark Phoenix cast.jpg|140|1150|The cast of ''Dark Phoenix'' promoting the film at the 2019 [[WonderCon]].

Many of the characters in the film turn against Xavier as some of his decisions regarding Jean Grey's abilities are revealed. Director [[Simon Kinberg]] felt that the character always acts out of concern for the \"greater good,\" though he may make some \"misguided\" choices at times. Kinberg hoped that each character would come across as having \"a valid point of view\" in the film.<ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" />\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: <br />Quicksilver's father and a powerful mutant who can control [[magnetic field]]s and manipulate metal, he is Xavier's former best friend and often rival. Magneto has formed a community of mutant refugees on the island of [[Genosha]],<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> which Kinberg compared to [[Israel]] in it being a homeland where mutants can be safe.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven / Mystique]]: <br />A shape-shifting mutant and Xavier's adopted sister. Lawrence described her role in the film as more maternal than before, as she leads the younger X-Men.<ref name=\"EWLawrence\" /> The film continues growing the schism between Mystique and Xavier, with Mystique not approving of some of Xavier's methods, though Kinberg hoped that this would be more subtle in ''Dark Phoenix'' than in previous ''X-Men'' films. The film also sees the character change between appearing as Raven and Mystique more than previously, with each change having a specific meaning to the character and story.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> She continues to have feelings for Beast.\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy / Beast]]: <br />A mutant with a beastly appearance and superhuman physical abilities. He is a teacher at Xavier's School and helps lead the younger X-Men. He continues to have feelings for Mystique.\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Jean Grey]] / [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]: <br />An extremely powerful mutant with telepathic and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers who is one of Xavier's most prized students. The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix entity]] is unleashed in the film, leading to a fight between the two personalities for control. Turner studied [[dissociative identity disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]] for the role, particularly for scenes where she has to change from the vulnerable Jean to the confident Phoenix.<ref name=\"EWTurner\" /> Kinberg said Turner has the lead role in the film, a first for the actress.<ref name=\"ChastainTHR\" /> Summer Fontana portrays a young Jean Grey.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers / Cyclops]]: <br />A mutant who fires concussive optic beams. The film develops his relationship with Jean Grey, which Kinberg called \"a huge part of the emotional core of the movie.\" This forces the character to become a leader in the film,<ref name=\"JeanScott\" /> as he is the most prominent character who holds on to hope as Jean grows more unstable.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Alexandra Shipp]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: <br />An African mutant who can control the weather.\n* [[Evan Peters]] as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver]]: <br />Magneto's mutant son who can move at [[Speedster (fiction)|superhuman speed]]. Peters described the character as more mature and subdued in the film, being focused on using his abilities for good as a member of the X-Men.<ref name=\"PetersSRMay2018\" />\n* [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] as [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler]]: <br />A German mutant who can teleport.\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Vuk:<br />The leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]] who manipulates the Phoenix. Kinberg described her as \"the devil on Jean's shoulder,\"<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> while Chastain called her character \"clinical.\"<ref name=\"EWChastain\" /> Chastain also plays Margaret Smith, the woman Vuk impersonates.\n* [[Scott Shepherd (actor)|Scott Shepherd]] as John Grey\n* [[Ato Essandoh]] as Jones, Vuk's second in command.\n* [[Brian d'Arcy James]] as the [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Halston Sage]] as [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] in the character's first cinematic appearance.<ref name=\"40Years\" />\n* [[Lamar Johnson (actor)|Lamar Johnson]] as [[Match (Marvel Comics)|Match]]\n\nAdditionally, Kota Eberhardt portrays telepath [[Selene (comics)|Selene Gallio]], while [[Andrew Stehlin]] portrays Ariki, a mutant who can utilize his hair braids as a weapon. Hannah Anderson portrays Jean's mother, Elaine. Veteran ''X-Men'' writer [[Chris Claremont]] makes a cameo appearance as a White House guest during the scene when Xavier accepts his award for rescuing the crew of the space shuttle ''Endeavour''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.looper.com/154834/easter-eggs-you-missed-in-x-men-dark-phoenix/ |title=Easter eggs you missed in X-Men: Dark Phoenix: Chris Claremont's cameo |first=Matt |last=Wilson |website=Looper.com |publisher=[[ZergNet]] |access-date=June 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter joining the 2003 film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', writer [[Zak Penn]] convinced director [[Bryan Singer]] not to adapt the [[Marvel Comics]] storyline \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" for the film, believing it was \"too soon to go into the Phoenix story and it was too soon to get cosmic.\"<ref name=\"PennX2\" /> The character of [[Jean Grey|Jean Grey / Phoenix]] was instead explored \"subtly\", with the intention of the full story being adapted in the next film instead.<ref name=\"PennX2\" /><ref name=\"KinbergX3\" /> Singer did not return to direct the sequel, ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', which was written by Penn and [[Simon Kinberg]]. The studio chose to adapt the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" as only one of the film's \"parallel storylines\", with an executive at [[20th Century Fox]] suggesting that the \"[[Gifted (comics)|Gifted]]\" storyline also be in that film.<ref name=\"KinbergX3\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/04/15/interview-zak-penn-on-the-grand-x-men-fans-and-co-writing-hulk/ |title=INTERVIEW: ZAK PENN ON THE GRAND, X-MEN FANS AND CO-WRITING HULK |access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> This version of the story was not well received by fans and critics. Kinberg stated that he and Penn were ultimately unhappy with how the adaptation turned out as well.<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" />\n\nAfter the timeline of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' franchise]] was [[retconned]] with the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', it was noted that a new adaptation of the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" could be made that ignores the events of ''The Last Stand''. Kinberg and Singer both expressed interest in the prospect, and hinted that 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' would set up elements for a retelling. ''Apocalypse'' introduces [[Sophie Turner]] as a young Jean Grey, and begins exploring \"how powerful she is.\"<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" /> By April 2016, the sequel to ''Apocalypse'' was believed to indeed re-adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga.\"<ref name=\"HHApr2016\" /> In May 2016, Kinberg said that the next ''X-Men'' film after ''Apocalypse'' would be set in the 1990s, advancing one decade, as had been done for each of the previous few ''X-Men'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2016\" /> He also noted that ''Apocalypse'' had introduced younger versions of several characters from the original ''X-Men'' films to give them a new [[origin story]]\u2014including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Jean Grey\u2014with the intention of then exploring them in their own line of films. He added that he also hoped to see the cast of the previous trilogy of films return, namely [[James McAvoy]] as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], [[Michael Fassbender]] as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkh\u00f6lme / Mystique]].<ref name=\"CastHopes\" />\n\nIn July, Kinberg said he would begin writing the next mainline ''X-Men'' film \"real soon\".<ref name=\"KinbergJul2016\" /> That November, Fox was said to be pressing \"the reset button\" on the franchise due to the financial and critical under-performance of ''Apocalypse'', with the franchise being reconfigured and Singer not returning to direct the next film. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, and [[Nicholas Hoult]]'s contracts from the previous trilogy had ended, but Kinberg was optimistically writing the new script with them in mind.<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> It was rumored in February 2017 that the next film would be titled ''X-Men: Supernova'', and would begin filming that June.<ref name=\"Supernova\" /> Also in February, Turner confirmed that she would return for the film.<ref name=\"TurnerFeb2017\" /> Kinberg was believed to be interested in making his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with the film,<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb2017\" /> and was described as the top contender for the job with interest from Fox. The studio was also looking to negotiate new deals with Lawrence, Fassbender, McAvoy, and Hoult to return.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20172\" /> By the end of the month, Kinberg described reports that he may direct the film as \"premature,\" but added that if he were to direct, he would not be daunted by the scale of the film due to his experience writing and producing many of the other ''X-Men'' films. He also reiterated that he would adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" differently to how it was for ''The Last Stand'' if given another opportunity to do so.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20173\" />\n\n===Writing and original two-part plan===\n\nSimon Kinberg wanted a two-film story, as hinted by Olivia Munn in an interview with Collider in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/olivia-munn-interview-lego-ninjago-movie-x-men-dark-phoenix/|title=Olivia Munn on 'The LEGO Ninjago Movie' & Returning for 'X-Men: Dark Phoenix'|first=Christina|last=Radish|date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' later confirmed this initial approach.

In addition to Turner, ''Apocalypse'' actors [[Alexandra Shipp]], [[Tye Sheridan]], and [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] were also confirmed to be returning, while producers for the film were revealed to be Kinberg and Parker. At that time, Chastain was in talks to join the cast as Shi'ar Empress [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]], the film's villain.

The final costumes for the film feature the yellow-and-blue design of the original comics, but combine features of designs from many different incarnations of the group. Kinberg also looked to ''Logan'' for general design inspiration, wanting to replicate the \"naturalistic\" and \"handmade\" quality of that film for the costumes, sets, props, and title design. He felt that this would give more impact to the large-scale elements of the film, and help it be more emotional, comparing this idea to the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on June 28, 2017, in [[Montreal]], Quebec,<ref name=\"FormalizedPlans\" /><ref name=\"ACTRAFilming\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Teen Spirit''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Mauro Fiore]] served as cinematographer.<ref name=\"Fiore\" /> Filming primarily took place at MELS Studios.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> Before the end of the month, [[Evan Peters]] was set to reprise his role as \"audience favorite\" character [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] from the previous films, and [[Lamar Johnson (actor)|Lamar Johnson]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"PetersJohnson\" /> At the start of August, Chastain confirmed her involvement in the film;<ref name=\"ChastainConfirmed\" /> she was interested in the story, after turning down roles in other superhero films, due to its focus on female characters.<ref name=\"XWomen\" /> Kinberg said he wanted the film to be \"human\" and emotional like previous ''X-Men'' films, and that he was looking to ground the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" story for his adaptation \"so it's not too intergalactic.\"<ref name=\"KinbergTFAug2017\" /> He later clarified that the film would still include alien characters as in the comic storyline, an element that was ignored for the ''Last Stand'' adaptation but which he felt was integral to the story.<ref name=\"KinbergETMay2018\" /><ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" /> He also said that the film would tonally be less operatic than previous ''X-Men'' films, which he hoped would make it more relatable for audiences.<ref name=\"KinbergETMay2018\" /> By September, [[Daniel Cudmore]] had stated that he would be appearing in the film, but could not confirm whether he would be reprising his role as [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] from previous films in the franchise.<ref name=\"CudmoreSep2017\" /> Chastain revealed that she was not actually playing Lilandra.<ref name=\"NoLilandra\" /> While [[Olivia Munn]] had initially said that she would reprise her role as [[Psylocke]]<!-- , and described ''Dark Phoenix'' as \"a two parter\" -->,<ref name=\"Munn\" /> by February 2019, she revealed that she was unable to reprise her role due to scheduling conflicts with filming ''[[The Predator (film)|The Predator]]''.<ref name=\"NoPsylocke\" /> Filming was completed on October 14, 2017.<ref name=\"ACTRAFilming\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn December 2017, Kinberg revealed that the film would be in post-production for almost a year, longer than usual for the series, because he wanted to take the time to have the visual effects look right by focusing on the \"nuance\" of the effects rather than the scale.<ref name=\"EWVisuals\" /> He also explained that he \"felt in his gut\" that this was the story that he needed to tell once Singer left the franchise, and that his vision for the film was \"so clear in my head, emotionally and visually, that it would have killed me to hand this to somebody else to direct.\" The film was described as being the most sinister and somber of the franchise, with McAvoy finding it to be the most emotional of the ''X-Men'' films he had worked on. It becomes a \"fight for Jean's soul\" and features a twist that was intended to have significant repercussions on the entire franchise.<ref name=\"EWCover\" /> Lawrence revealed that she had worked to convince Kinberg to direct the film, and had promised to return for it if he did so, despite her dislike of the make-up required to portray her character.<ref name=\"EWLawrence2\" /> It was also revealed then that the film would introduce a version of the island [[Genosha]], adapted to the film as a mutant refuge led by Magneto;<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> and that it would focus on the female characters more so than previous films in the series, particularly Jean Grey as both the protagonist and antagonist of the film, and Chastain's character, with whom Grey has a complex relationship.<ref name=\"XWomen\" />\n\nFox delayed the film's release in March 2018, pushing it back from November 2, 2018 to February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This was because Fox and Kinberg wanted to schedule some routine reshoots for the film after receiving feedback from audiences during a test screening, but were not able to get all of the necessary cast members together until August or September 2018. This would not have left enough time to complete post-production work such as visual effects for the additional footage before the November 2018 release date.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> Specifically, Kinberg was looking to rework the third act of the film, and re-wrote part of the script ahead of the reshoots. With post-production already underway, the film was believed to have been under-budget, while the planned reshoots would cost less than $10{{nbsp}}million. Additionally, Kinberg and the studio had been looking to change the film's release date for \"some time\" to avoid competing with the Christmas-oriented film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. The new February release date was noted as having the film opening away from other major studio films, while placing it on [[President's Day]] weekend, which had proved to be successful for ''Deadpool'' and Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"THRReshoots\" /> Addressing the reshoots, Kinberg confirmed the scheduling delays, and described the photography as a \"normal\" part of the film's creation that would allow him \"enough time to have it ready and looking perfect.\"<ref name=\"KinbergReshoots\" />\n\nAt the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include \"''X-Men''\" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in ''Dark Phoenix'' which was compared to the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' logo;<ref name=\"FirstLogo\" /> the film was later confirmed to be simply titled ''Dark Phoenix'' in the United States, and ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' for release internationally.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /><ref name=\"ColliderReshootsAug2018\" /> The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand\u00e9 studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period,<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> and had begun by August 31.<ref name=\"ReshootsBegin\" /> At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that had previously been reserved for Fox's newly-delayed and later canceled ''[[Gambit (unproduced film)|Gambit]]'' film.<ref name=\"Sep2018ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"DisneyMay2019ScheduleUpdate\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/gambit-movie-dead/ |title=\u2018Gambit\u2019 Is Dead; Disney Drops the X-Men Spinoff from the Schedule |website=[[Collider]] |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |date=May 7, 2019 |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/78CX9lkfJ |archive-date=May 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The move was also reportedly to appease [[James Cameron]], who had ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' moved from December to February and did not want competition from another Fox would-be blockbuster; Kinberg and ''Dark Phoenix'' producers opposed the change as the film was not made for a summer and was facing heavy competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"We Were Wrong\": Behind Fox's ''Dark Phoenix'' Debacle |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/we-were-wrong-behind-dark-phoenix-foxs-dismal-x-men-franchise-finale-plans-1216859 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Lana Condor]] revealed that she was unable to return as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] due to her commitment to the film ''[[To All the Boys I've Loved Before (film)|To All the Boys I've Loved Before]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"CondorCollider\" /> [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]] serves as editor for the film.<ref name=\"EditorSmith\" /> Visual effects were provided by [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], MELS, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Soho VFX, with Phil Brennan serving as the main visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VisualEffects\" />\n\n==Music==\nEvan Peters stated in January 2018 that [[Hans Zimmer]] was composing the score for the film,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /> despite Zimmer having said in March 2016 that he would not score another superhero film following his experience working on ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"ZimmerNoSupers\" /> Zimmer later explained that in conversations with director [[Ron Howard]] he was convinced to not keep a \"blanket\" view, and to focus on waiting for the right story rather than avoiding an entire genre. When Kinberg approached him at a concert to talk about his vision for ''Dark Phoenix'', Zimmer realized that the story was one that he wanted to help tell, and that the film was an opportunity for something that he had always wanted to try in a film score; he decided to join the production.<ref name=\"ZimmerExplanation\" /> In writing the film's score, Zimmer wrote new themes for the X-Men, Magneto, and the Phoenix, and chose to omit previously established themes written by previous composer [[John Ottman]].\n\nOn May 23, 2019, the track \"Extraordinary Being\" by [[Emeli Sand\u00e9]] was released as the official soundtrack.<ref>{{Cite AV Media |last=EmeliSandeVEVO |title=Emeli Sand\u00e9 - Extraordinary Being \u2013 In Collaboration with X-Men: Dark Phoenix |date=May 23, 2019 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnYsk7jfUTE |via= [[YouTube]] |access-date=May 27, 2019}}</ref> The soundtrack was released digitally on June 7.
