The Cultural Capital status was expected to bring about an abrupt increase in quantity and quality of cultural events in 2007.\n\n==Tourism==\nIn 2007, Sibiu was the [[European Capital of Culture]] (together with [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]). This was the most important cultural event that has ever happened in the city, and a great number of tourists came, both domestic and foreign.\n\nThe city of Sibiu and its surroundings are one of the most visited areas in Romania. It holds one of the best preserved historical sites in the country, many of its medieval fortifications having been kept in excellent state. Its old center has begun the process for becoming a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2004. Sibiu and its surrounding area have many significant museums, with 12 institutions housing art collections, paintings, and exhibits in decorative arts, archeology, anthropology, history, industrial archeology and history of technology and natural sciences.\n\nThe city also lies close to the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]] \u2013 a popular trekking destination, close to the [[P\u0103ltini\u0219]] and Arena Platos ski resorts \u2013 both winter holiday destinations, and it is at the heart of the former Saxon communities in Transylvania renowned for its [[Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|fortified churches]].[[File:Sibiu Biserica evanghelica Gusterita (5).JPG|thumb|Fortified Lutheran church of Gu\u0219teri\u021ba neighbourhood, 13th century]]\n\nSince 2007, a traditional [[Christmas market]] has been held in Sibiu.

The old city of Sibiu lies on the right bank of the Cibin River, on a hill situated at about 200 m from the river. It consists of two distinct entities: the ''Upper Town'' and the ''Lower Town''. Traditionally, the Upper Town was the wealthier part and commercial outlet, while the Lower Town served as the manufacturing area.\n\n'''The Lower Town'''\n\n(German: ''Unterstadt'', Romanian: ''Ora\u0219ul de jos'') comprises the area between the river and the hill, and it developed around the earliest fortifications. The streets are long and quite wide for medieval city standards, with small city squares at places. The architecture is rather rustic: typically two-storey houses with tall roofs and gates opening passages to inner courts.\n\nMost of the exterior fortifications were lost to industrial development and modern urban planning in the mid-late 19th century; only four towers still exist. A building associated with newer urbanism of the period is the ''Independen\u021ba'' Highschool.\n\nThis area has the oldest church in the city \u2013 in fact the first mention of the city itself is the reconfirmation of the local provostship as ''praepositum Cibiniensem'' \u2013 that was the religious center of the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]] until the 15th century.<ref>Magyar katolikus lexikon XII.

As the main area for [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] activities, the area contains most points of interest in the city.\n\n'''Grand Square'''\n\n(German: ''Gro\u00dfer Ring'', Romanian: ''Pia\u021ba Mare'' ) is, as its name suggests, the [[List of town squares by size|largest square]] of the city, and has been the center of the city since the 15th century. At 142 meters long and 93 meters wide, it is one of the largest ones in Transylvania.\n\n[[Brukenthal Palace]], one of the most important [[Baroque]] monuments in Romania, lies on the north-western corner of the square. It was erected between 1777 and 1787 as the main residence for the Governor of Transylvania [[Samuel von Brukenthal]]. It houses the main part of the ''National Brukenthal Museum'', opened in 1817, making it one of the oldest museums in the world. Next to the palace is the ''Blue House'' or ''Moringer House'', an 18th-century Baroque house bearing the old coat of arms of Sibiu on its fa\u00e7ade.\n\n[[File:Sibiu (15257629580).jpg|213x213px|thumb|Sibiu City Hall]]\n\nOn the north side is the [[Jesuit Church, Sibiu|Jesuit Church]], along with its dependencies, the former residence of the Jesuits in Sibiu. Also on the north side, at the beginning of the 20th century an ''[[Art Nouveau]]'' building was constructed on the west part, now it houses the mayor's office.\n\n[[File:Podul mincinosilor.jpg|thumb|212x212px|Liars Bridge in Lesser Square, erected in 1859]]\n\nNext to the Jesuit Church on the north side is the [[Council Tower of Sibiu|Council Tower]], the city's symbol. This former fortification tower from the 13th century has been successively rebuilt over the years. The building nearby used to be the City Council's meeting place; beneath it lies an access way between the ''Grand Square'' and the ''Lesser Square''.\n\nOn the south and east sides are two- or three-storey houses, having tall attics with small windows known as the ''city's eyes''. Most of these houses are dated 15th to 19th centuries, and most of them are Renaissance or Baroque in style.\n\n'''Lesser Square'''\n(''Small Square'', German: ''Kleiner Ring'') as its name implies, is a smaller square situated in the northern part of the Upper Town. After the 2007 rehabilitation there has been an increase in the number of small businesses such as pubs and restaurants in this area.\n\nThe square is connected to the other two squares and to other streets by small, narrow passages. The main access from the Lower City is through Ocnei Street, which divides the square in two. The street passes under the ''Liar's Bridge'' \u2013 the first bridge in Romania to have been cast in iron (1859).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|title=The Bridge of Lies, Sibiu\u00b7|last=WR|website=welcometoromania.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104171643/http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo the right of the bridge is another symbol of the city, ''The House of the Arts'', a 14th-century arched building formerly belonging to the Butchers' Guild. On the left side of the bridge is the ''Luxemburg House'', a Baroque four-storey building.\n\n'''Huet Square'''\nis the third of the three main squares of Sibiu. Its most notable feature is the [[Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral|Evangelical Lutheran Cathedral]] in its center. It is the place where the earliest fortifications have been built in the late 12th century or early 13th century. The buildings around this square are mainly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. On the west side lies the Brukenthal Highschool, in place of a former 14th-century school.\n\n[[File:Sibio, la Dika Turo de oriento, 4.jpeg|thumb|215x215px|right|[[Thalia Hall|The Thick Tower]]]]\n\n'''The Fortifications'''\nof Sibiu made the city one of the most important fortified cities in Central Europe. Multiple rings were built around the city, most of them out of clay bricks. The south-eastern fortifications are the best kept, and all three parallel lines are still visible. The first is an exterior earth mound, the second is a 10-meter-tall red brick wall, and the third line comprises towers linked by another 10-meter-tall wall. All structures are connected via a labyrinth of tunnels and passageways, designed to ensure transport between the city and lines of defense.\n\nIn the 16th century more modern elements were added to the fortifications, mainly leaf-shaped [[bastion]]s. Two of these survived to this day, as the ''Haller Bastion'' (all the way down Coposu Boulevard) and \"Soldisch Bastion\".\n\n'''The Passage of the Stairs''',\nleads down to the lower section of Sibiu. It descends along some fortifications under the support arches. It is one of several passages linking the two sides of the old city.\n\n==Health==\n[[File:Spitalul Judetean Sibiu.jpg|thumb|Sibiu County Hospital]]\nSibiu is one of the important medical centers of Romania, housing many important medical facilities:\n* County Hospital\n* Academic Emergency Hospital;\n* Hospital of Pediatrics;\n* Military Emergency Hospital;\n* CFR Hospital (Romanian Railways Hospital);\n* \"Dr. Gheorghe Preda\" Psychiatry Hospital\n* other smaller private clinics\n\nThe city also houses one of the largest private hospitals in the country, Polisano.\n\n==Education==\n\n[[File:Liceul Samuel von Brukenthal.jpg|thumb|Samuel von Brukenthal High School]]\n\nSibiu is an important centre of higher education, with over 23,000 students in four public and private higher institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulbsibiu.ro/en/despre_ulbs/|title=:: L B U S :: About LBUS|first=Departamentul de Comunica\u0163ii \u0219i Marketing al|last=ULBS|website=www.ulbsibiu.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404104637/http://www.ulbsibiu.ro/en/despre_ulbs/|archivedate=4 April 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mediafax.ro/social/reportaj-sefa-de-promotie-la-academia-fortelor-terestre-a-fost-o-lupta-intre-a-rezista-si-a-avea-vointa-foto-12957248 Land Forces Military Academy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130124204/http://www.mediafax.ro/social/reportaj-sefa-de-promotie-la-academia-fortelor-terestre-a-fost-o-lupta-intre-a-rezista-si-a-avea-vointa-foto-12957248 |date=2015-01-30 }} at mediafax.ro</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roger-univ.ro/universitate/prezentare-urgs.html|title=Universitatea Romano-Germana din Sibiu|website=www.roger-univ.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219173051/http://www.roger-univ.ro/universitate/prezentare-urgs.html|archivedate=19 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uamsibiu.ro/universitate/istoric/|title=Istoricul Universitatii Alma Mater Sibiu \u2013 Universitatea Alma Mater Sibiu|website=www.uamsibiu.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504160830/http://www.uamsibiu.ro/universitate/istoric/|archivedate=4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu]] was founded in 1990, with five faculties: Engineering and Sciences; Language Sciences; History and Law; Medicine; Food and Textile Processing Technology.

The first Romanian-owned bank had its headquarters here (The ''Albina'' Bank), as did the [[Asocia\u021bia Transilvan\u0103 pentru Literatura Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u0219i Cultura Poporului Rom\u00e2n|ASTRA]] (Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and Romanian's People Culture). After the [[Romanian Orthodox]] Church was granted status in the [[Austrian Empire]] from the 1860s onwards, Sibiu became the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan seat]], and the city is still regarded as the third-most important centre of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. Between the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and 1867 (the year of the ''[[Ausgleich]]''), Sibiu was the meeting-place of the [[Transylvanian Diet]], which had taken its most representative form after the Empire agreed to extend voting rights in the region.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], when [[Austria-Hungary]] was dissolved, Sibiu became part of Romania; the majority of its population was still ethnic German (until 1941) and counted a large Romanian community, as well as a smaller Hungarian one. Starting from the 1950s and until after 1990, most of the city's ethnic Germans emigrated to [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. Among the roughly 2,000 who have remained is [[Klaus Iohannis|Klaus Johannis]], the {{As of|2014|alt=current}} [[President of Romania]].\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Sibiu_Centru_vedere_panoramica.jpg|Panoramic view of Sibiu from 1928\nFile:Sibiu vedere de pe Deaulul Gusteritei.jpg|View from Gu\u0219teri\u021ba hill\nFile:Johann B\u00f6bel - Poarta Burger-Ocnei, la 1857.jpg|Burger-Ocnei gate\nFile:Johann Bobel - Turnul Portii Cisnadiei.jpg|Cisn\u0103die's Gate Tower\nFile:Johann B\u00f6bel - Strada Turnului \u015fi biserica Evanghelic\u0103.jpg|Tower's Street and the Evangelical Lutheran Church\nFile:Hermanstatt (Sibiu), 17th century engraving.jpg|Copper engraving of Sibiu (''Hermanstatt''), {{circa}} 1630.\nFile:Lanzedelli - T\u00e2rg \u00een Transilvania 4.jpg|A busy market scene in Sibiu, 1818\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Sibiu region.png|thumb|Topographic map of the Sibiu region]]\n\n[[File:Sibiu-pictures-001.jpg|alt=|thumb|]]\n\nSibiu is situated near the geographical center of Romania at {{Coord|45.792784|N|24.152069|E|region:RO_type:city}}. Set in the Cibin Depression, the city is about 20&nbsp;km from the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]], 12&nbsp;km from the [[Cibin Mountains]], and about 15&nbsp;km from the [[Lotru Mountains]], which border the depression in its southwestern section. The northern and eastern limits of Sibiu are formed by the T\u00e2rnavelor Plateau, which descends to the Cibin Valley through Gu\u0219teri\u021bei Hill.\n \nThe Cibin river as well as some smaller streams runs through Sibiu. The geographical position of Sibiu makes it one of the most important transportation hubs in Romania with important roads and railway lines passing through it.\n\n===City districts===\nThe following districts are part of Sibiu. Some were villages annexed by the city but most were built as the city developed and increased its surface.\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*Historic Center \u2013 Divided into the Upper Town and Lower Town\n*Centru (Centre)\n*Lupeni\n*[[Trei Stejari]]\n*[[Vasile Aron (Sibiu district)|Vasile Aaron]]\n*[[Hipodrom (Sibiu district)|Hipodrom I, II, III, IV]]\n*[[Valea Aurie]] (Golden Valley)\n*Tili\u0219ca\n*[[\u0218trand]]\n*[[Turni\u0219or]] (Little Tower; {{lang-de|Neppendorf}})\n*Pia\u021ba Cluj\n*[[\u021aiglari]]\n*[[Terezian (Sibiu district)|Terezian]]\n*Re\u0219i\u021ba\n*[[Lazaret (Sibiu district)|Lazaret]]\n*[[Gu\u0219teri\u021ba]] ({{lang-de|Hammersdorf}})\n*[[Brosc\u0103rie]]\n*Viile Sibiului\n*Tineretului\n*Veteranilor de R\u0103zboi\n{{Div col end}}\n\nThe Southern part, including the [[ASTRA National Museum Complex]] and the Zoo, also falls within the city limits.\n\n== Climate ==\nSibiu's climate is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] with average temperatures of {{convert|8|to|9|C|F}}.

Also, here you can find the Zoological Garden and Ethnography Museum.\n\nThere is a [[Sibiu Steam Locomotives Museum|Steam Locomotives Museum]] close to the railway station, sheltering around 40 [[steam locomotive|locomotives]], two of which are functional.\n\nThe first park in the city was The Promenade, later called \"The Disabled Promenade.\" established in 1791, today part of Parcul Cet\u0103\u021bii (Citadel Park). Current arrangement of the park, including the space between the walls, dates from 1928.\n\nThe Sub Arini Park, established between 1857 and 1859 based on plans of military engineer Michael Seyfried,<ref>[https://www.siebenbuerger.de/zeitung/artikel/kultur/14902-eine-graefin-mit-herz.html]</ref> is one of the biggest and best-maintained parks in Romania.

The Cultural Capital status was expected to bring about an abrupt increase in quantity and quality of cultural events in 2007.\n\n==Tourism==\nIn 2007, Sibiu was the [[European Capital of Culture]] (together with [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]). This was the most important cultural event that has ever happened in the city, and a great number of tourists came, both domestic and foreign.\n\nThe city of Sibiu and its surroundings are one of the most visited areas in Romania. It holds one of the best preserved historical sites in the country, many of its medieval fortifications having been kept in excellent state. Its old center has begun the process for becoming a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2004. Sibiu and its surrounding area have many significant museums, with 12 institutions housing art collections, paintings, and exhibits in decorative arts, archeology, anthropology, history, industrial archeology and history of technology and natural sciences.\n\nThe city also lies close to the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]] \u2013 a popular trekking destination, close to the [[P\u0103ltini\u0219]] and Arena Platos ski resorts \u2013 both winter holiday destinations, and it is at the heart of the former Saxon communities in Transylvania renowned for its [[Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|fortified churches]].[[File:Sibiu Biserica evanghelica Gusterita (5).JPG|thumb|Fortified Lutheran church of Gu\u0219teri\u021ba neighbourhood, 13th century]]\n\nSince 2007, a traditional [[Christmas market]] has been held in Sibiu.

The old city of Sibiu lies on the right bank of the Cibin River, on a hill situated at about 200 m from the river. It consists of two distinct entities: the ''Upper Town'' and the ''Lower Town''. Traditionally, the Upper Town was the wealthier part and commercial outlet, while the Lower Town served as the manufacturing area.\n\n'''The Lower Town'''\n\n(German: ''Unterstadt'', Romanian: ''Ora\u0219ul de jos'') comprises the area between the river and the hill, and it developed around the earliest fortifications. The streets are long and quite wide for medieval city standards, with small city squares at places. The architecture is rather rustic: typically two-storey houses with tall roofs and gates opening passages to inner courts.\n\nMost of the exterior fortifications were lost to industrial development and modern urban planning in the mid-late 19th century; only four towers still exist. A building associated with newer urbanism of the period is the ''Independen\u021ba'' Highschool.\n\nThis area has the oldest church in the city \u2013 in fact the first mention of the city itself is the reconfirmation of the local provostship as ''praepositum Cibiniensem'' \u2013 that was the religious center of the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]] until the 15th century.<ref>Magyar katolikus lexikon XII.

As the main area for [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] activities, the area contains most points of interest in the city.\n\n'''Grand Square'''\n\n(German: ''Gro\u00dfer Ring'', Romanian: ''Pia\u021ba Mare'' ) is, as its name suggests, the [[List of town squares by size|largest square]] of the city, and has been the center of the city since the 15th century. At 142 meters long and 93 meters wide, it is one of the largest ones in Transylvania.\n\n[[Brukenthal Palace]], one of the most important [[Baroque]] monuments in Romania, lies on the north-western corner of the square. It was erected between 1777 and 1787 as the main residence for the Governor of Transylvania [[Samuel von Brukenthal]]. It houses the main part of the ''National Brukenthal Museum'', opened in 1817, making it one of the oldest museums in the world. Next to the palace is the ''Blue House'' or ''Moringer House'', an 18th-century Baroque house bearing the old coat of arms of Sibiu on its fa\u00e7ade.\n\n[[File:Sibiu (15257629580).jpg|213x213px|thumb|Sibiu City Hall]]\n\nOn the north side is the [[Jesuit Church, Sibiu|Jesuit Church]], along with its dependencies, the former residence of the Jesuits in Sibiu. Also on the north side, at the beginning of the 20th century an ''[[Art Nouveau]]'' building was constructed on the west part, now it houses the mayor's office.\n\n[[File:Podul mincinosilor.jpg|thumb|212x212px|Liars Bridge in Lesser Square, erected in 1859]]\n\nNext to the Jesuit Church on the north side is the [[Council Tower of Sibiu|Council Tower]], the city's symbol. This former fortification tower from the 13th century has been successively rebuilt over the years. The building nearby used to be the City Council's meeting place; beneath it lies an access way between the ''Grand Square'' and the ''Lesser Square''.\n\nOn the south and east sides are two- or three-storey houses, having tall attics with small windows known as the ''city's eyes''. Most of these houses are dated 15th to 19th centuries, and most of them are Renaissance or Baroque in style.\n\n'''Lesser Square'''\n(''Small Square'', German: ''Kleiner Ring'') as its name implies, is a smaller square situated in the northern part of the Upper Town. After the 2007 rehabilitation there has been an increase in the number of small businesses such as pubs and restaurants in this area.\n\nThe square is connected to the other two squares and to other streets by small, narrow passages. The main access from the Lower City is through Ocnei Street, which divides the square in two. The street passes under the ''Liar's Bridge'' \u2013 the first bridge in Romania to have been cast in iron (1859).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|title=The Bridge of Lies, Sibiu\u00b7|last=WR|website=welcometoromania.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104171643/http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo the right of the bridge is another symbol of the city, ''The House of the Arts'', a 14th-century arched building formerly belonging to the Butchers' Guild. On the left side of the bridge is the ''Luxemburg House'', a Baroque four-storey building.\n\n'''Huet Square'''\nis the third of the three main squares of Sibiu. Its most notable feature is the [[Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral|Evangelical Lutheran Cathedral]] in its center. It is the place where the earliest fortifications have been built in the late 12th century or early 13th century. The buildings around this square are mainly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. On the west side lies the Brukenthal Highschool, in place of a former 14th-century school.\n\n[[File:Sibio, la Dika Turo de oriento, 4.jpeg|thumb|215x215px|right|[[Thalia Hall|The Thick Tower]]]]\n\n'''The Fortifications'''\nof Sibiu made the city one of the most important fortified cities in Central Europe. Multiple rings were built around the city, most of them out of clay bricks. The south-eastern fortifications are the best kept, and all three parallel lines are still visible. The first is an exterior earth mound, the second is a 10-meter-tall red brick wall, and the third line comprises towers linked by another 10-meter-tall wall. All structures are connected via a labyrinth of tunnels and passageways, designed to ensure transport between the city and lines of defense.\n\nIn the 16th century more modern elements were added to the fortifications, mainly leaf-shaped [[bastion]]s.
