(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2018. This was the last season with current, and longest running host, [[Art Rooijakkers]]. The season took place in [[Georgia (Country)|Georgia]], the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union State]]. The season premiered on January 6, 2018. The Live Finale aired on March 10, 2018 from the [[Vondelpark|VondelCS pavilion]]. During the Finale, Ruben Hein was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac17,750.-. Hein had successfully unmasked [[Jan Versteegh]] as the Mole of 2018, outwitting his fellow finalist, [[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]].\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe season began with the candidates unknowingly scattered in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine for the first assignment to discover where the host country of the season will be, Georgia. This season also had a candidate quit in the season for the upkeep of their mental health; a series' first compared to previous medical evacuations and withdrawals. The season also changed the unmasking of the Mole. Where after the final test had been written, the finalists were informed that they would find out who the Mole is along with the rest of the Netherlands at the Live Finale. Typically the finalists would be informed of the Mole immediately after the final test and the secret would remain until the unmasking during the Live Finale broadcast.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Jan Versteegh]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Ruben Hein|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Simone Weimans|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Stine Jensen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 13\n|4th place\n|-\n|[[Loes Haverkort]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 9\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Emilio Guzman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 7\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Bella Hay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[Jean-Marc van Tol]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|Quit\n|-\n|{{ill|Ron Boszhard|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 1\n|8th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

The remaining four candidates were dropped off in Tbilisi and instructed to find where the three missing candidates were hidden underground. The Underground candidates have no idea where they have been hidden, but hold the information in which the Searchers could use to find them. The underground candidates were hidden in a tunnel maze, where throughout the tunnels they could find simple instructions and photographs of where the Searchers had to go in order to receive new instructions. The Underground candidate's phone could only receive signal at a small opening far from the instructions board in the maze. With a phone in hand, the Searchers have 45 minutes to find the Underground candidates to earn \u20ac1,500 for the pot.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment, and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Niets is Wat Het Lijkt (Nothing is What It Seems)'''\nThe day of the assignment was Georgia's independence day from the Soviet Union. The candidates were taken to the 9 April Park, for a private interrogation with Art. Between Art and the candidate stood a table with a series of flowchart questions. Before Art begins the interrogation, he informs each of the candidates that they could earn an Exemption for the Finale if they do well in this assignment. The interrogation begins with Art asking if the candidates want to know who the Mole already, with the candidate having to answer yes or no. They proceed through the flowchart answering Art's questions about their personal tactics and potential dilemmas until they reach the bottom of the table, with a final question between \u20ac5,000 for the pot, or a group exemption.\n\nAt the end of the assignment, Art informed the candidates that if they had paid enough attention, they would have noticed that they were visited by the Mole during their interrogations in the park. Essentially being the exemption to the Finale that Art mentioned at the beginning of the assignment.\n\n'''Rode Draad (Red Wire) - Max. \u20ac5,000.-'''\nThe candidates were taken to the old Soviet District in Tbilisi, a lower-class district with Soviet era accommodations. On top of one of these buildings, the candidates had to zipline between two buildings. With the questions from yesterday noted by Art, the candidates had a choice of earning \u20ac5,000 or a group exemption in this assignment. The choice that the majority had chosen would be inside one of the envelopes Art gives the candidates. The objective of the assignment was for the candidates to transport envelopes across the zipline, earning whatever they managed to bring to Art. Each candidate were allowed to take only one out of the seven envelopes while they ziplined. Ruben panicked and refused to do the zipline, which led to Stine also deciding to not complete the assignment.\n\nOnly five of the candidates completed the zipline, with Art informing the candidates afterwards that they had been competing for \u20ac5,000. After opening all the envelopes, the candidates had successfully brought the \u20ac5,000 envelope to Art, and was added to the pot.\n\n===Episode 5 - Zienswijzen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 5 - Zienswijzen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 03/02/2018<br>Locations: [[Tbilisi|Tbilisi, Georgia]] \n|-\n!

To prevent a candidate from seeing their screen, and earning money for the pot, both boards had to have matching green screens showing. Art presents a series of questions to the candidates, if they are correct, the candidate can turn a red screen green, or opt out from turning a green screen red. The candidates were divided into two teams: three designated to the red board, two assigned the green board.\n\nThe candidates chose to prevent their results from being shown, except for Simone.

Two longer, diverting routes would lead the finalists to \u20ac2,500.- that they could add to the pot, or to see the Mole at the end of the longest route.

During the reunion after the unmasking, the executed candidates revealed that it was Olcay who misled them into thinking Ruben was the Mole. Meanwhile, Ruben only started to catch onto Jan as the Mole when Loes and Stine, his two main suspects were executed one after the other. In the Final Test, Olcay answered her test thinking Ruben was the Mole, and ultimately had no chance in beating Ruben. During the Final Test, Olcay skipped past the Money and Mole route, as she got lost and took too much time getting to the test. While both Jan and Ruben grabbed the extra \u20ac2,500.-.

However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe season began with the candidates unknowingly scattered in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine for the first assignment to discover where the host country of the season will be, Georgia. This season also had a candidate quit in the season for the upkeep of their mental health; a series' first compared to previous medical evacuations and withdrawals. The season also changed the unmasking of the Mole. Where after the final test had been written, the finalists were informed that they would find out who the Mole is along with the rest of the Netherlands at the Live Finale. Typically the finalists would be informed of the Mole immediately after the final test and the secret would remain until the unmasking during the Live Finale broadcast.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Jan Versteegh]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Ruben Hein|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Simone Weimans|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Stine Jensen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 13\n|4th place\n|-\n|[[Loes Haverkort]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 9\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Emilio Guzman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 7\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Bella Hay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[Jean-Marc van Tol]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|Quit\n|-\n|{{ill|Ron Boszhard|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 1\n|8th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

With a phone in hand, the Searchers have 45 minutes to find the Underground candidates to earn \u20ac1,500 for the pot.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment, and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Niets is Wat Het Lijkt (Nothing is What It Seems)'''\nThe day of the assignment was Georgia's independence day from the Soviet Union. The candidates were taken to the 9 April Park, for a private interrogation with Art. Between Art and the candidate stood a table with a series of flowchart questions. Before Art begins the interrogation, he informs each of the candidates that they could earn an Exemption for the Finale if they do well in this assignment. The interrogation begins with Art asking if the candidates want to know who the Mole already, with the candidate having to answer yes or no. They proceed through the flowchart answering Art's questions about their personal tactics and potential dilemmas until they reach the bottom of the table, with a final question between \u20ac5,000 for the pot, or a group exemption.\n\nAt the end of the assignment, Art informed the candidates that if they had paid enough attention, they would have noticed that they were visited by the Mole during their interrogations in the park. Essentially being the exemption to the Finale that Art mentioned at the beginning of the assignment.\n\n'''Rode Draad (Red Wire) - Max. \u20ac5,000.-'''\nThe candidates were taken to the old Soviet District in Tbilisi, a lower-class district with Soviet era accommodations. On top of one of these buildings, the candidates had to zipline between two buildings. With the questions from yesterday noted by Art, the candidates had a choice of earning \u20ac5,000 or a group exemption in this assignment. The choice that the majority had chosen would be inside one of the envelopes Art gives the candidates. The objective of the assignment was for the candidates to transport envelopes across the zipline, earning whatever they managed to bring to Art. Each candidate were allowed to take only one out of the seven envelopes while they ziplined. Ruben panicked and refused to do the zipline, which led to Stine also deciding to not complete the assignment.\n\nOnly five of the candidates completed the zipline, with Art informing the candidates afterwards that they had been competing for \u20ac5,000. After opening all the envelopes, the candidates had successfully brought the \u20ac5,000 envelope to Art, and was added to the pot.\n\n===Episode 5 - Zienswijzen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 5 - Zienswijzen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 03/02/2018<br>Locations: [[Tbilisi|Tbilisi, Georgia]] \n|-\n!

Throughout the 50 rooms in the hotel hid \u20ac1,500, and Jokers. The candidates are locked in rooms with keys to other rooms each, except for the Treasurer, who starts the assignment free to move around the Hotel from the beginning. The candidates had 15 minutes to free themselves and search the rooms for the money.\n\n\u20ac500.- was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Ladas met Lading (Ladas with Luggage) - Max. \u20ac1,500.-'''\nDivided between three houses in the village of Sukchai, Art instructed the candidates to help the families living in these houses pack their furniture into three Ladas, within 30 minutes. The next part of the assignment had the candidates try to add more furniture into their Ladas to add \u20ac50 per item for the pot, with 15 minutes to repack. The owner of the furniture was \u20ac250 for the pot. Once the repack was done, the candidates had to drive the Ladas to the new houses.

At the Medea Sanatorium, stood two identical boards with eight rotatable screens. Five screens had the candidates' names on them, and three had \u20ac500 on them. To prevent a candidate from seeing their screen, and earning money for the pot, both boards had to have matching green screens showing. Art presents a series of questions to the candidates, if they are correct, the candidate can turn a red screen green, or opt out from turning a green screen red. The candidates were divided into two teams: three designated to the red board, two assigned the green board.\n\nThe candidates chose to prevent their results from being shown, except for Simone. Nothing was added to the pot. Simone saw a Green screen for her results, even with a Black Exemption nullifying her Jokers, and everyone proceeded to the next episode.\n\n===Episode 7 - Schijn Werper===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 7 - Schijn Werper\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 17/02/2018<br>Locations: [[Tsqaltubo|Tskaltubo, Georgia]] \u2192 [[Kutaisi|Kutaisi, Georgia]] \u2192 [[Borjomi|Borjomi, Georgia]]\n|-\n!

The candidates have a total of 21 minutes to complete the tasks. Each completed task added \u20ac250.- to the pot, with an additional \u20ac380.- if the candidates got a specific task correct.\n\n\u20ac750.- was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Praten als Brugman (Talk like a Bridgekeeper) - Max. \u20ac1,250.-'''\nArriving in the town of Kutaisi, the candidates had three hours to paint an important restored bridge for the town before the mayor officiates the grand re-opening.

As soon as they entered the Castle, they had to follow signs leading them to where their final test would be written. Two longer, diverting routes would lead the finalists to \u20ac2,500.- that they could add to the pot, or to see the Mole at the end of the longest route. However, their time for the test starts as soon as they enter the castle, so the diversions cost time on their final test.\n\nThe final amount earned for the winner's pot would be revealed during the Live Finale, where for the first time in the series' history would include the unmasking of the Mole in front of the live audience, 167 days after the final day of filming.\n\n===Episode 10 - Finale===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 10 - Finale\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 10/03/2018<br>Locations: [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, Netherlands]] \n|-\n!

Jan, Ruben, and Olcay arrived at Vondelpark for a final debriefing by Art. At first, Art revealed that Olcay was not the Mole nor the winner, before Jan Versteegh finally stepped forward to reveal himself as the Mole. During the reunion after the unmasking, the executed candidates revealed that it was Olcay who misled them into thinking Ruben was the Mole. Meanwhile, Ruben only started to catch onto Jan as the Mole when Loes and Stine, his two main suspects were executed one after the other. In the Final Test, Olcay answered her test thinking Ruben was the Mole, and ultimately had no chance in beating Ruben. During the Final Test, Olcay skipped past the Money and Mole route, as she got lost and took too much time getting to the test. While both Jan and Ruben grabbed the extra \u20ac2,500.-. With Jan being the Mole, his \u20ac2,500.- was to fool the audiences, and it was not added to the final winner's pot of \u20ac17,750.-.\n\n==Mole Sabotage==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Hidden Clues==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Viewing Figures===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"| Viewing Figures\n|-\n! #\n!
