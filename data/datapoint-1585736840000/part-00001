Since 2016, [[Lodewijk Asscher]] has been [[Leader of the Labour Party (Netherlands)|Leader of the Labour Party]]. The party fell to only nine seats in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] at the [[2017 Dutch general election|2017 general election]], making it only the seventh-largest faction in the chamber\u2013its worst showing ever. However, the PvdA rebounded with a first-place finish in the [[2019 European Parliament election in the Netherlands]], winning 6 of 26 seats with 19% of the vote.\n\nThe Labour Party is a member of the European [[Party of European Socialists]] and the global [[Progressive Alliance]]. In the [[European Parliament]], where the Labour Party has 6 seats, it is part of the parliamentary group [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n\n===1946\u20131965===\n[[File:Willem Drees 1958.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Willem Drees]], co-Founder and Leader from 1946 until 1958, [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] from 1948 until 1958]]\n\nDuring the [[Netherlands in World War II|German Occupation of the Netherlands]] in the [[Second World War]] a group of prominent Dutchmen of all democratic political ideologies were interned as hostages in [[Gymnasium Beekvliet|St. Michielsgestel]] by the German occupation authorities. They came to the consensus that the pre-war fragmentation of Dutch political life, known as \"[[Pillarization]],\" should be overcome after the war in a so-called [[Breakthrough (Dutch political history)|''doorbraak'']]. These people formed the [[Nederlandse Volksbeweging|Dutch People's Movement]] (NVB) immediately after the war ended in 1945. The new movement promoted the foundation of the Labour Party (''Partij van de Arbeid \u2013 PvdA'')) on 9 February 1946, through a merger of three pre-war parties: the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (SDAP), the social liberal [[Free-thinking Democratic League]] (VDB) and progressive-Protestant [[Christian Democratic Union (Netherlands)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU).<ref name=\"Moldenhauer2001\">{{cite book|author=Gebhard Moldenhauer|title=Die Niederlande und Deutschland: einander kennen und verstehen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vm_h-NPz1T8C&pg=PA113|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|isbn=978-3-89325-747-8|page=113}}</ref> They were joined by individuals from [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Resistance during World War II|resistance group]] ''Christofoor'', as well as some of the more progressive members of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] parties [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) and [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP). The founding Congress was chaired by NVB-member [[Willem Banning]].\n\nThe founders of the PvdA wanted to create a [[Big tent|broad party]], breaking with the historic tradition of pillarisation. The party combined [[socialism|socialist]]s with [[Liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Christian left|progressive Christian]]s.<ref name=\"Notermans2001\">{{cite book|author=Ton Notermans|title=Social Democracy and Monetary Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKQB3czNk1oC&pg=PA226|date=January 2001|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-806-5|page=226}}</ref> However, the party was unable to break pillarisation. Instead the new party renewed the close ties that the SDAP had with other socialist organisations (see [[#Linked organisations|linked organisations]]). In 1948 some of the left-liberal members, led by former VDB leader [[Pieter Oud]], left the PvdA after concluding it had become too socialist for their liking. Together with the [[Freedom Party (Netherlands)|Freedom Party]], they formed the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD), a [[conservative liberalism|conservative liberal]] party.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1958, the PvdA led [[coalition government]]s with the [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP), and combinations of VVD, ARP and CHU, with the PvdA's [[Willem Drees]] as prime minister. The KVP and the PvdA together had a large majority in parliament. Under his leadership the Netherlands recovered from the war, began to build its [[welfare state]]  and [[Indonesia]] became [[Indonesian National Revolution|independent]].\n\nAfter the cabinet crisis of 1958, the PvdA was replaced by the VVD. The PvdA was in opposition until 1965. The electoral support of PvdA voters began to decline.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n[[File:Joop den Uyl 1975.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Joop den Uyl]], Leader from 1966 until 1986, [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] from 1973 until 1977]]\n\nIn 1965 a conflict in the KVP-ARP-CHU-VVD cabinet made continuation of the government impossible. The three [[Confessionalism (politics)|confessional]], Christian-influenced parties turned towards the PvdA. Together they formed the [[Cals cabinet]], with KVP leader [[Jo Cals]] as prime minister. This cabinet was also short lived and conflict ridden. The conflicts culminated in the fall of the Cals cabinet over [[economic policy]].\n\nMeanwhile, a younger generation was attempting to gain control of the PvdA. A group of young PvdA members, calling themselves the [[New Left (Netherlands)|New Left]], changed the party. The New Left believed the party should become oriented towards the [[new social movements]], adopting their anti-parliamentary strategies and their issues, such as [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]], [[environmentalism|environment]]al conservation and [[Third World]] development. Prominent New Left members were [[Jan Nagel]], [[Andr\u00e9 van der Louw]] and [[Bram Peper]]. One of their early victories followed the fall of the Cals cabinet. The party Congress adopted a motion that made it impossible for the PvdA to govern with the KVP and its Protestant allies. In response to the growing power of the New Left group, a group of older, [[centrism|centrist]] party members, led by Willem Drees' son, [[Willem Drees, Jr.]] founded the New Right. They split in 1970, after it was clear that they had lost the conflict with the New Left, and founded a new moderate Social Democratic party, [[Democratic Socialists '70]] (DS70).\n\nUnder the New Left, the PvdA started a strategy of polarisation, striving for a cabinet based on a progressive majority in parliament. In order to form that cabinet the PvdA allied itself with the [[social liberalism|social liberal]] party [[Democrats 66]] (D66) and the progressive Christian [[Political Party of Radicals]] (PPR). The alliance was called the Progressive Accord (PAK). In the [[1971 Dutch general election|1971]] and [[1972 Dutch general election|1972 elections]], these three parties promised to form a cabinet with a radical common programme after the elections. They were unable to gain a majority in either election. In 1971, they were kept out of cabinet, and the party of former PvdA members, DS70, became a partner of the [[First Biesheuvel cabinet]].\n\nIn the 1972 elections, neither the PvdA and its allies or the KVP and its allies were able to gain a majority. The two sides were forced to work together. [[Joop den Uyl]], the leader of the PvdA, led the cabinet. The cabinet was an [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|extra-parliamentary cabinet]] and it was composed of members of the three progressive parties and members of the KVP and the ARP. The cabinet attempted to radically reform government, society and the economy, and a wide range of progressive social reforms were enacted during its time in office, such as significant increases in welfare payments and the indexation of benefits and the minimum wage to the cost of living.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2exQnhFNyYC&pg=PA235|title=Recasting European Welfare States|first1=Maurizio|last1=Ferrera|first2=Martin|last2=Rhodes|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780714651040}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it also faced economic decline and was riddled with personal and ideological conflicts. Especially, the relationship between Prime Minister Den Uyl and the KVP [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Deputy Prime Minister]], [[Dries Van Agt|Van Agt]] was very problematic. The conflict culminated just before the 1977 elections, the cabinet fell. The [[1977 Dutch general election|1977 general election]] were won by the PvdA, but the ideological and personal conflict between Van Agt and Den Uyl prevented the formation of a new centre-left cabinet. After very long cabinet formation talks, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA), itself a new [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] political formation composed of KVP, CHU and ARP, formed government with the VVD, based on a very narrow majority. The PvdA was left in opposition.\n\nIn the [[1981 Dutch general election|1981 general election]], the incumbent CDA-VVD cabinet lost their majority. The CDA remained the largest party, but it was forced to co-operate with the PvdA and D66 (the PPR had left the alliance, after losing the 1977 elections). In the new cabinet led by Van Agt, Den Uyl returned to cabinet, now as Deputy Prime Minister. The personal and ideological conflict between Van Agt and Den Uyl culminated in the fall of the cabinet just months after it was formed. The VVD and the CDA regained their majority in the [[1982 Dutch general election|1982 general election]] and retained it in the [[1986 Dutch general election|1986 general election]]. The PvdA was left in opposition. During this period, the party began to reform. In 1986, Den Uyl left politics, appointing former [[trade union]] leader [[Wim Kok]] as his successor.\n\n[[File:Wim Kok 1994.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Wim Kok]], Leader from 1986 until 2001, [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] from 1994 until 2002]]\n\n===1989\u20132010===\nAfter the [[1989 Dutch general election|1989 general election]], the PvdA returned to cabinet together with the CDA. Kok became Deputy Prime Minister to CDA leader [[Ruud Lubbers]]. The PvdA accepted the major economic reforms the previous Lubbers cabinets made, including [[privatization|privatisation]] of [[Government-owned corporation|public enterprise]]s and [[welfare reform|reform of the welfare state]]. They continued these policies in this cabinet. The cabinet faced heavy protest from the unions and saw major political conflict within the PvdA itself.\n\nIn the [[1994 Dutch general election|1994 general election]], the PvdA and CDA coalition lost its majority in parliament. The PvdA, however, emerged as the biggest party. Kok formed a government together with the conservative liberal VVD and social liberal D66. The so-called ''[[purple (government)|purple government]]'' was a political novelty, because it was the first since 1918 without any ministers from the CDA or its predecessors. The [[First Kok cabinet]] continued the Lubbers-era economic reforms, but combined this with a progressive outlook on ethical questions and promises of political reform. Kok became a very popular Prime Minister; he was not a partisan figure but combined successful [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] policies with the charisma of a national leader. In the [[1998 Dutch general election|1998 general election]], the cabinet was rewarded for its stewardship of the economy. The PvdA and the VVD increased their seats, at the cost of D66; the [[Second Kok cabinet]] was formed.\n\nThe PvdA was expected to perform very well in the [[2002 Dutch general election|2002 general election]]. Kok left politics leaving the leadership of the party to his preferred successor [[Ad Melkert]]. But the political rise of [[Pim Fortuyn]] frustrated these hopes. The PvdA lost the 2002 elections, and the party's parliamentary representation fell from 45 seats to 23. The loss was blamed on the uncharismatic new leader Melkert, the perceived arrogance of the PvdA and the inability to answer to the [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] issues Fortuyn raised, especially [[immigration]] and [[Racial integration|integration]]. Melkert resigned as party leader and was replaced by [[Jeltje van Nieuwenhoven]]. The PvdA was kept out of cabinet. The government formed by CDA, VVD and the [[Pim Fortuyn List]] (LPF) fell after a very short period.\n\n[[File:Bos Dutch politician kabinet Balkenende IV.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Wouter Bos]], Leader from 2002 until 2010]]\n\nMeanwhile, [[Wouter Bos]], [[Undersecretary]] in the [[second Kok cabinet|second purple cabinet]], was elected leader of the PvdA in a referendum among PvdA members, being elected closely to [[Jouke de Vries]]. He started to democratise the party organisation and began an ideological reorientation. In the [[2003 Dutch general election|2003 general election]], Wouter Bos managed to regain almost all seats lost in the previous election, and the PvdA was once again the second largest party in the Netherlands, only slightly smaller than the CDA. Personal and ideological conflicts between Bos and the CDA leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] prevented the formation of a CDA-PvdA cabinet. Instead, the PvdA was kept out of government by the formation of cabinet of the CDA, the VVD, and D66, the latter being former allies of PvdA. In the [[2006 Dutch municipal elections|2006 municipal elections]], the renewed PvdA performed very well. The PvdA became by far the largest party nationally, while the three governing parties lost a considerable number of seats in municipal councils.\n\nPvdA party lost the race for [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] to the CDA after suffering a loss of 9 seats in the [[2006 Dutch general election|2006 general election]]. The PvdA now held only 33 seats, losing many votes to the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] (SP). The PvdA had previously distanced themselves from the idea of a voting bloc on the left. It did, however, join the [[fourth Balkenende cabinet]] on 22 February 2007, in which Wouter Bos became [[Ministry of Finance (Netherlands)|minister of Finance]]. In the aftermath of the lost elections, the entire party executive stepped down on 26 April 2007. On Saturday 20 February 2010, the Labour Party withdrew from the government after arguments over the Dutch role in [[Afghanistan]].\n\n===Since 2010===\nAfter withdrawing from the government, Wouter Bos announced he would leave politics to spend more time with his wife and two daughters. Then mayor of Amsterdam, [[Job Cohen]], took his place as leader of the PvdA. In the [[2010 Dutch general election|2010 election]], the PvdA won 30 seats, a loss of three, and were narrowly overtaken by the VVD. After the election, a \"Purple Coalition\" was considered \u2013 it would have required a fourth party in addition to the VVD, PvdA and D66 \u2013 but talks broke down and the PvdA entered opposition.\n\n[[File:Lodewijk Asscher 2015 (1).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lodewijk Asscher]], Leader since 2016]]\n\nCohen resigned as leader in February 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/dutch-labour-party-leader-resigns|title=Dutch Labour Party leader resigns|website=RNW Media|accessdate=8 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808095205/http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/dutch-labour-party-leader-resigns|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Diederik Samsom]] was subsequently elected the party leader. In the [[2012 Dutch general election|2012 general election]], the Labour Party won 38 seats, a gain of 8, defying initial predictions that the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] would overtake them. Following the election the party entered a governing coalition with the VVD under [[Mark Rutte]], with Labour's [[Lodewijk Asscher]] becoming Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nOpinion polls suggested that popular support for the PvdA fell into a gradual decline in the years after the 2012 election. The party was polled as low as 5% by ''Peil'' on 8 May 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.noties.nl/v/get.php?a=peil.nl&s=weekpoll&f=2016-05-08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512194452/https://www.noties.nl/v/get.php?a=peil.nl&s=weekpoll&f=2016-05-08.pdf |archivedate=12 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagelijksestandaard.nl/2016/05/tijd-voor-een-revolutie-in-de-politiek-gros-burgemeesters-heeft-niets-met-het-volk/|title=Tijd voor een revolutie in de politiek: gros burgemeesters heeft niets met het volk|date=9 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510105552/http://www.dagelijksestandaard.nl/2016/05/tijd-voor-een-revolutie-in-de-politiek-gros-burgemeesters-heeft-niets-met-het-volk/|archivedate=10 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In December 2016 Samson was defeated by [[Lodewijk Asscher]] in a party leadership election.\n\nIn the [[2017 Dutch general election|Dutch general election of 2017]], the PvdA suffered the biggest defeat in Dutch electoral history, receiving only 5.7% of the votes and losing 29 of its 38 seats. Asscher did not resign from his post, claiming the defeat was his predecessor's responsibility. The party experienced a degree of revival in 2019, obtaining the most votes in [[2019 European Parliament election in the Netherlands|that year's European Parliament election]]. This marked the first time the PvdA has finished on top in a national election since [[1998 Dutch general election|1998]].\n\n==Ideology==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\nThe PvdA began as a traditional [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, committed to building a [[welfare state]]. During the 1970s, it radicalised its programme and included new issues, such as women's liberation, environmental conservation and Third World development. During the 1990s, it moderated its programme to include [[third way]] economic and social positions, including reform of the welfare state and privatisation of public enterprise. In 2005, the party adopted a new programme of principles, expressing a [[centre-left]] ideology. Its core issues are [[employment]], [[social security]] and [[welfare]], and investing in public [[education]], [[public safety]] and [[health care]].\n\n==Electorate==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nHistorically, the PvdA was supported by the [[working class]]. Currently the party is supported relatively well by [[civil servant]]s, [[Migrant worker|migrants]], and the elder working class.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The party has historically been very

protest 20041002.JPG|thumb|right|200px|PvdA activists in a demonstration in October 2004]]\n\nThe highest organ of the PvdA is the [[Party Congress|Congress]], formed by delegates from the municipal branches. It convenes once every year. It appoints the party board, decides the order of candidates on electoral lists for the Senate, House of Representatives and European Parliament and has the final say over the party programme. Since 2002, a [[referendum]] of all members has partially replaced the Congress. Both the [[lijsttrekker]] of the House of Representatives candidate list, who is the political leader of the party, and the party chairman, who leads the party organisation, are selected by such a referendum. In 2002, Wouter Bos won the [[2002 PvdA leadership election|PvdA leadership election]].\n\n===Members===\nThe PvdA has 45,040 members.<ref name=\"auto\"/> They are organised in over 500 municipal branches.\n\n===Linked organisations===\nThe [[Young Socialists (Netherlands)|Young Socialists in the PvdA]] is the youth organisation of the PvdA. It is a member of [[Young European Socialists]] and the [[International Union of Socialist Youth]]. They publish the periodical ''Lava''.\n\n''Rood'' is the party periodical. It appears eight times a year.\n\nThe scientific institute (or [[think tank]]) of the PvdA is the [[Wiardi Beckman Stichting|Wiardi Beckman Foundation]]. It publishes the periodical ''Socialisme & Democratie''.\n\nThe PvdA participates in the [[Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy]], a democracy assistance organisation of seven Dutch political parties.\n\n===International organisations===\nThe PvdA is a full member of the [[Party of European Socialists]] and was formerly an observer member of the [[Socialist International]] until December 2014, having previously downgraded their membership in December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pvda.nl/berichten/2012/12/PvdA+steunt+oprichting+Progressive+Alliance|title=PvdA steunt oprichting Progressive Alliance|website=PvdA \u2013 Partij van de Arbeid|accessdate=8 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924083343/http://www.pvda.nl/berichten/2012/12/PvdA+steunt+oprichting+Progressive+Alliance|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The PvdA joined the [[Progressive Alliance]], a new international network for social democratic political parties, at its founding event on 22 May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pvda.nl/berichten/2013/05/Progressive+Alliance+opgericht+in+Leipzig/|title=Progressive Alliance opgericht in Leipzig \u2013 PvdA|date=24 May 2013|website=pvda.nl|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224054121/http://www.pvda.nl/berichten/2013/05/Progressive+Alliance+opgericht+in+Leipzig|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Pillarised organisations===\nDuring the period of strong [[pillarisation]] the PvdA had strong links with the social democratic broadcasting organisation [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA Broadcasting Association]], the [[Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen|Dutch Association of Trade Unions]], and the paper ''[[Het Vrije Volk]]''.\n\n===Relationships to other parties===\nHistorically, the PvdA has co-operated in cabinets with the Christian democratic [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA), [[Political Party of Radicals]] (PPR), [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP), [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP), [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) and [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|ChristianUnion]] (CU) parties and the liberal parties [[Democrats 66]] (D66) and [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD). Between 1971 and 1977, PvdA was allied with D66 and the PPR. After 1977 until 1989, it was closely allied to D66. Since 2003, the relationship between the PvdA and D66 has considerably worsened, at first because PvdA was in opposition to the [[second Balkenende cabinet]] which D66 had co-operated in.\n\nDuring the governance of the [[second Balkenende cabinet|second]] and [[third Balkenende cabinet]], the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] and [[GroenLinks|GreenLeft]] were calling for closer cooperation with the PvdA, calling to form a shadow government against the Balkenende cabinet, PvdA leader Bos held this off.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n[[File:Lodewijk Asscher 2012 (1).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Lodewijk Asscher]], Leader in the House of Representatives since 2016]]\n[[File:8.

In the [[European Parliament]], where the Labour Party has 6 seats, it is part of the parliamentary group [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n\n===1946\u20131965===\n[[File:Willem Drees 1958.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Willem Drees]], co-Founder and Leader from 1946 until 1958, [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] from 1948 until 1958]]\n\nDuring the [[Netherlands in World War II|German Occupation of the Netherlands]] in the [[Second World War]] a group of prominent Dutchmen of all democratic political ideologies were interned as hostages in [[Gymnasium Beekvliet|St. Michielsgestel]] by the German occupation authorities. They came to the consensus that the pre-war fragmentation of Dutch political life, known as \"[[Pillarization]],\" should be overcome after the war in a so-called [[Breakthrough (Dutch political history)|''doorbraak'']]. These people formed the [[Nederlandse Volksbeweging|Dutch People's Movement]] (NVB) immediately after the war ended in 1945. The new movement promoted the foundation of the Labour Party (''Partij van de Arbeid - PvdA'')) on 9 February 1946, through a merger of three pre-war parties: the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (SDAP), the social liberal [[Free-thinking Democratic League]] (VDB) and progressive-Protestant [[Christian Democratic Union (Netherlands)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU).<ref name=\"Moldenhauer2001\">{{cite book|author=Gebhard Moldenhauer|title=Die Niederlande und Deutschland: einander kennen und verstehen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vm_h-NPz1T8C&pg=PA113|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|isbn=978-3-89325-747-8|page=113}}</ref> They were joined by individuals from [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Resistance during World War II|resistance group]] ''Christofoor'', as well as some of the more progressive members of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] parties [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) and [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP). The founding Congress was chaired by NVB-member [[Willem Banning]].\n\nThe founders of the PvdA wanted to create a [[Big tent|broad party]], breaking with the historic tradition of pillarisation. The party combined [[socialism|socialist]]s with [[Liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Christian left|progressive Christian]]s.<ref name=\"Notermans2001\">{{cite book|author=Ton Notermans|title=Social Democracy and Monetary Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKQB3czNk1oC&pg=PA226|date=January 2001|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-806-5|page=226}}</ref> However, the party was unable to break pillarisation. Instead the new party renewed the close ties that the SDAP had with other socialist organisations (see [[#Linked organisations|linked organisations]]). In 1948 some of the left-liberal members, led by former VDB leader [[Pieter Oud]], left the PvdA after concluding it had become too socialist for their liking. Together with the [[Freedom Party (Netherlands)|Freedom Party]], they formed the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD), a [[conservative liberalism|conservative liberal]] party.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1958, the PvdA led [[coalition government]]s with the [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP), and combinations of VVD, ARP and CHU, with the PvdA's [[Willem Drees]] as prime minister. The KVP and the PvdA together had a large majority in parliament. Under his leadership the Netherlands recovered from the war, began to build its [[welfare state]]  and [[Indonesia]] became [[Indonesian National Revolution|independent]].\n\nAfter the cabinet crisis of 1958, the PvdA was replaced by the VVD. The PvdA was in opposition until 1965. The electoral support of PvdA voters began to decline.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n[[File:Joop den Uyl 1975.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Joop den Uyl]], Leader from 1966 until 1986, [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] from 1973 until 1977]]\n\nIn 1965 a conflict in the KVP-ARP-CHU-VVD cabinet made continuation of the government impossible. The three [[Confessionalism (politics)|confessional]], Christian-influenced parties turned towards the PvdA. Together they formed the [[Cals cabinet]], with KVP leader [[Jo Cals]] as prime minister. This cabinet was also short lived and conflict ridden. The conflicts culminated in the fall of the Cals cabinet over [[economic policy]].\n\nMeanwhile, a younger generation was attempting to gain control of the PvdA. A group of young PvdA members, calling themselves the [[New Left (Netherlands)|New Left]], changed the party. The New Left believed the party should become oriented towards the [[new social movements]], adopting their anti-parliamentary strategies and their issues, such as [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]], [[environmentalism|environment]]al conservation and [[Third World]] development. Prominent New Left members were [[Jan Nagel]], [[Andr\u00e9 van der Louw]] and [[Bram Peper]]. One of their early victories followed the fall of the Cals cabinet. The party Congress adopted a motion that made it impossible for the PvdA to govern with the KVP and its Protestant allies. In response to the growing power of the New Left group, a group of older, [[centrism|centrist]] party members, led by Willem Drees' son, [[Willem Drees, Jr.]] founded the New Right. They split in 1970, after it was clear that they had lost the conflict with the New Left, and founded a new moderate Social Democratic party, [[Democratic Socialists '70]] (DS70).\n\nUnder the New Left, the PvdA started a strategy of polarisation, striving for a cabinet based on a progressive majority in parliament. In order to form that cabinet the PvdA allied itself with the [[social liberalism|social liberal]] party [[Democrats 66]] (D66) and the progressive Christian [[Political Party of Radicals]] (PPR). The alliance was called the Progressive Accord (PAK). In the [[1971 Dutch general election|1971]] and [[1972 Dutch general election|1972 elections]], these three parties promised to form a cabinet with a radical common programme after the elections. They were unable to gain a majority in either election. In 1971, they were kept out of cabinet, and the party of former PvdA members, DS70, became a partner of the [[First Biesheuvel cabinet]].\n\nIn the 1972 elections, neither the PvdA and its allies or the KVP and its allies were able to gain a majority. The two sides were forced to work together. [[Joop den Uyl]], the leader of the PvdA, led the cabinet. The cabinet was an [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|extra-parliamentary cabinet]] and it was composed of members of the three progressive parties and members of the KVP and the ARP. The cabinet attempted to radically reform government, society and the economy, and a wide range of progressive social reforms were enacted during its time in office, such as significant increases in welfare payments and the indexation of benefits and the minimum wage to the cost of living.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2exQnhFNyYC&pg=PA235|title=Recasting European Welfare States|first1=Maurizio|last1=Ferrera|first2=Martin|last2=Rhodes|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780714651040}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it also faced economic decline and was riddled with personal and ideological conflicts. Especially, the relationship between Prime Minister Den Uyl and the KVP [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Deputy Prime Minister]], [[Dries Van Agt|Van Agt]] was very problematic. The conflict culminated just before the 1977 elections, the cabinet fell. The [[1977 Dutch general election|1977 general election]] were won by the PvdA, but the ideological and personal conflict between Van Agt and Den Uyl prevented the formation of a new centre-left cabinet. After very long cabinet formation talks, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA), itself a new [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] political formation composed of KVP, CHU and ARP, formed government with the VVD, based on a very narrow majority. The PvdA was left in opposition.\n\nIn the [[1981 Dutch general election|1981 general election]], the incumbent CDA-VVD cabinet lost their majority. The CDA remained the largest party, but it was forced to co-operate with the PvdA and D66 (the PPR had left the alliance, after losing the 1977 elections). In the new cabinet led by Van Agt, Den Uyl returned to cabinet, now as Deputy Prime Minister. The personal and ideological conflict between Van Agt and Den Uyl culminated in the fall of the cabinet just months after it was formed. The VVD and the CDA regained their majority in the [[1982 Dutch general election|1982 general election]] and retained it in the [[1986 Dutch general election|1986 general election]]. The PvdA was left in opposition. During this period, the party began to reform. In 1986, Den Uyl left politics, appointing former [[trade union]] leader [[Wim Kok]] as his successor.\n\n[[File:Wim Kok 1994.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Wim Kok]], Leader from 1986 until 2001, [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] from 1994 until 2002]]\n\n===1989\u20132010===\nAfter the [[1989 Dutch general election|1989 general election]], the PvdA returned to cabinet together with the CDA. Kok became Deputy Prime Minister to CDA leader [[Ruud Lubbers]]. The PvdA accepted the major economic reforms the previous Lubbers cabinets made, including [[privatization|privatisation]] of [[Government-owned corporation|public enterprise]]s and [[welfare reform|reform of the welfare state]]. They continued these policies in this cabinet. The cabinet faced heavy protest from the unions and saw major political conflict within the PvdA itself.\n\nIn the [[1994 Dutch general election|1994 general election]], the PvdA and CDA coalition lost its majority in parliament. The PvdA, however, emerged as the biggest party. Kok formed a government together with the conservative liberal VVD and social liberal D66. The so-called ''[[purple (government)|purple government]]'' was a political novelty, because it was the first since 1918 without any ministers from the CDA or its predecessors. The [[First Kok cabinet]] continued the Lubbers-era economic reforms, but combined this with a progressive outlook on ethical questions and promises of political reform. Kok became a very popular Prime Minister; he was not a partisan figure but combined successful [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] policies with the charisma of a national leader. In the [[1998 Dutch general election|1998 general election]], the cabinet was rewarded for its stewardship of the economy. The PvdA and the VVD increased their seats, at the cost of D66; the [[Second Kok cabinet]] was formed.\n\nThe PvdA was expected to perform very well in the [[2002 Dutch general election|2002 general election]]. Kok left politics leaving the leadership of the party to his preferred successor [[Ad Melkert]]. But the political rise of [[Pim Fortuyn]] frustrated these hopes. The PvdA lost the 2002 elections, and the party's parliamentary representation fell from 45 seats to 23. The loss was blamed on the uncharismatic new leader Melkert, the perceived arrogance of the PvdA and the inability to answer to the [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] issues Fortuyn raised, especially [[immigration]] and [[Racial integration|integration]]. Melkert resigned as party leader and was replaced by [[Jeltje van Nieuwenhoven]]. The PvdA was kept out of cabinet. The government formed by CDA, VVD and the [[Pim Fortuyn List]] (LPF) fell after a very short period.\n\n[[File:Bos Dutch politician kabinet Balkenende IV.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Wouter Bos]], Leader from 2002 until 2010]]\n\nMeanwhile, [[Wouter Bos]], [[Undersecretary]] in the [[second Kok cabinet|second purple cabinet]], was elected leader of the PvdA in a referendum among PvdA members, being elected closely to [[Jouke de Vries]]. He started to democratise the party organisation and began an ideological reorientation. In the [[2003 Dutch general election|2003 general election]], Wouter Bos managed to regain almost all seats lost in the previous election, and the PvdA was once again the second largest party in the Netherlands, only slightly smaller than the CDA. Personal and ideological conflicts between Bos and the CDA leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] prevented the formation of a CDA-PvdA cabinet. Instead, the PvdA was kept out of government by the formation of cabinet of the CDA, the VVD, and D66, the latter being former allies of PvdA. In the [[2006 Dutch municipal elections|2006 municipal elections]], the renewed PvdA performed very well. The PvdA became by far the largest party nationally, while the three governing parties lost a considerable number of seats in municipal councils.\n\nPvdA party lost the race for [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] to the CDA after suffering a loss of 9 seats in the [[2006 Dutch general election|2006 general election]]. The PvdA now held only 33 seats, losing many votes to the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] (SP). The PvdA had previously distanced themselves from the idea of a voting bloc on the left. It did, however, join the [[fourth Balkenende cabinet]] on 22 February 2007, in which Wouter Bos became [[Ministry of Finance (Netherlands)|minister of Finance]]. In the aftermath of the lost elections, the entire party executive stepped down on 26 April 2007. On Saturday 20 February 2010, the Labour Party withdrew from the government after arguments over the Dutch role in [[Afghanistan]].\n\n===Since 2010===\nAfter withdrawing from the government, Wouter Bos announced he would leave politics to spend more time with his wife and two daughters. Then mayor of Amsterdam, [[Job Cohen]], took his place as leader of the PvdA. In the [[2010 Dutch general election|2010 election]], the PvdA won 30 seats, a loss of three, and were narrowly overtaken by the VVD. After the election, a \"Purple Coalition\" was considered - it would have required a fourth party in addition to the VVD, PvdA and D66 - but talks broke down and the PvdA entered opposition.\n\n[[File:Lodewijk Asscher 2015 (1).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lodewijk Asscher]], Leader since 2016]]\n\nCohen resigned as leader in February 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/dutch-labour-party-leader-resigns|title=Dutch Labour Party leader resigns|website=RNW Media|accessdate=8 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808095205/http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/dutch-labour-party-leader-resigns|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Diederik Samsom]] was subsequently elected the party leader. In the [[2012 Dutch general election|2012 general election]], the Labour Party won 38 seats, a gain of 8, defying initial predictions that the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] would overtake them. Following the election the party entered a governing coalition with the VVD under [[Mark Rutte]], with Labour's [[Lodewijk Asscher]] becoming Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nOpinion polls suggested that popular support for the PvdA fell into a gradual decline in the years after the 2012 election. The party was polled as low as 5% by ''Peil'' on 8 May 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.noties.nl/v/get.php?a=peil.nl&s=weekpoll&f=2016-05-08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512194452/https://www.noties.nl/v/get.php?a=peil.nl&s=weekpoll&f=2016-05-08.pdf |archivedate=12 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagelijksestandaard.nl/2016/05/tijd-voor-een-revolutie-in-de-politiek-gros-burgemeesters-heeft-niets-met-het-volk/|title=Tijd voor een revolutie in de politiek: gros burgemeesters heeft niets met het volk|date=9 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510105552/http://www.dagelijksestandaard.nl/2016/05/tijd-voor-een-revolutie-in-de-politiek-gros-burgemeesters-heeft-niets-met-het-volk/|archivedate=10 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In December 2016 Samson was defeated by [[Lodewijk Asscher]] in a party leadership election.\n\nIn the [[2017 Dutch general election|Dutch general election of 2017]], the PvdA suffered the biggest defeat in Dutch electoral history, receiving only 5.7% of the votes and losing 29 of its 38 seats. Asscher did not resign from his post, claiming the defeat was his predecessor's responsibility. The party experienced a degree of revival in 2019, obtaining the most votes in [[2019 European Parliament election in the Netherlands|that year's European Parliament election]]. This marked the first time the PvdA has finished on top in a national election since [[1998 Dutch general election|1998]].\n\n==Ideology==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\nThe PvdA began as a traditional [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, committed to building a [[welfare state]]. During the 1970s, it radicalised its programme and included new issues, such as women's liberation, environmental conservation and Third World development. During the 1990s, it moderated its programme to include [[third way]] economic and social positions, including reform of the welfare state and privatisation of public enterprise. In 2005, the party adopted a new programme of principles, expressing a [[centre-left]] ideology. Its core issues are [[employment]], [[social security]] and [[welfare]], and investing in public [[education]], [[public safety]] and [[health care]].\n\n==Electorate==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nHistorically, the PvdA was supported by the [[working class]]. Currently the party is supported relatively well by [[civil servant]]s, [[Migrant worker|migrants]], and the elder working class.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The party has historically been very strong in the major cities, such as [[Amsterdam]] and [[Rotterdam]], and in the northern provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]] and [[Drenthe]].\n\n== Organisation ==\n{{More

branches. It convenes once every year. It appoints the party board, decides the order of candidates on electoral lists for the Senate, House of Representatives and European Parliament and has the final say over the party programme. Since 2002, a [[referendum]] of all members has partially replaced the Congress. Both the [[lijsttrekker]] of the House of Representatives candidate list, who is the political leader of the party, and the party chairman, who leads the party organisation, are selected by such a referendum.

Between 1971 and 1977, PvdA was allied with D66 and the PPR. After 1977 until 1989, it was closely allied to D66. Since 2003, the relationship between the PvdA and D66 has considerably worsened, at first because PvdA was in opposition to the [[second Balkenende cabinet]] which D66 had co-operated in.\n\nDuring the governance of the [[second Balkenende cabinet|second]] and [[third Balkenende cabinet]], the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] and [[GroenLinks|GreenLeft]] were calling for closer cooperation with the PvdA, calling to form a shadow government against the Balkenende cabinet, PvdA leader Bos held this off.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n[[File:Lodewijk Asscher 2012 (1).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Lodewijk Asscher]], Leader in the House of Representatives since 2016]]\n[[File:8.
