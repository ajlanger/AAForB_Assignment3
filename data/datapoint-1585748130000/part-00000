Accidents -->\n<section begin=\"summary\" />In March 2019, [[National aviation authority|aviation authorities]] around the world [[Aircraft on ground|grounded]] the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] passenger [[airliner]] after two new 737 MAX aircraft crashed within five months, killing all 346 people aboard both flights, [[Lion Air Flight 610]] on October 29, 2018 and [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]] on March 10, 2019. Ethiopian Airlines grounded its remaining MAX fleet on March 10, day of the crash. On March 11, the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] ordered the first nationwide grounding, followed by most other regulators in quick succession. Meanwhile, the [[U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] asserted the MAX's [[Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community|continued airworthiness]] until it received new evidence of accident similarities on March 13. By March 18, all 387 airplanes, which served 8,600 flights each week for 59 airlines, were grounded worldwide. Boeing suspended deliveries to airlines, but produced another 400 aircraft before halting manufacturing in January 2020.\n\n<!-- 2. MCAS -->\nAfter the first accident, Boeing instructed pilots to follow an [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|existing procedure]] to recover from [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]] caused by a new flight control system, [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System]] (MCAS), which had been omitted from crew manuals and training. In a private analysis, the FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|predicted further accidents]] if MCAS was not revised, but believed that the [[emergency airworthiness directive]] would suffice until Boeing delivered a permanent solution.\n\n<!-- 3.  Aftermath: inquiries -->\nAfter the groundings, the [[U.S. Congress]], FBI and ad hoc panels began investigating FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|certification]] of the MAX, particularly the [[Organization Designation Authorization|delegation of authority]] that allowed Boeing to act on behalf of the FAA. Several [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Supporting systems|system and manufacturing defects]] were uncovered, in addition to problems with MCAS. Boeing eventually reversed its policy and recommended flight simulator training for all MAX pilots. The longest ever grounding for a U.S. airliner was estimated to cost Boeing $18.6 billion by March 2020.<!--ref name=Flight13mar2020-->\n\n<!-- 4.  Aftermath: final reports -->\nInvestigators published their findings on the first anniversaries of the accidents in October 2019 and March 2020. The Indonesian [[National Transportation Safety Committee|NTSC]] faulted airplane design, certification, maintenance, and flight crew actions. The Ethiopian [[Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority|ECAA]], which determined that the flight crew had attempted the recovery procedure, assigned blame to the aircraft's software design. The U.S. [[NTSB]] concluded that  malfunctions resulted in multiple cockpit alerts that likely confused the flight crews. The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] criticized Boeing's \"culture of concealment\" during certification and in the aftermath of both accidents.<section end=\"summary\" />\n<!-- THE SECTION TAGS ARE PLACED HERE TO ALLOW TRANSCLUSION OF THIS INTRODUCTION into Boeing 737 MAX EDITS BETWEEN THE TAGS APPEAR IN THAT ARTICLE -->\n<!-- The tags must stay in these locations next to the notes. -->\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n* On {{date|29 October 2018|MDY}}, a 737 MAX 8 operating [[Lion Air Flight 610]] crashed after take-off from Jakarta, killing 189 people, leading Boeing to publicly unveil the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System|MCAS]], a new automated flight control on the MAX that could cause unintended [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]], but was omitted from crew manuals and training.<ref name=Flight13mar2020/>\n* On November 6, 2018, Boeing issued a [[service bulletin]] warning that with \"erroneous {{abbr|AOA|angle of attack}} data, the pitch trim system can trim the stabilizer nose down in increments lasting up to 10 seconds\" which \"can be stopped and reversed with the use of the electric stabilizer trim switches but may restart 5 seconds after\" and instructed pilots to counteract it by running the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|Runaway stabilizer and manual trim]] procedure.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/boeing-nearing-737-max-fleet-bulletin-on-aoa-warning-after-lion-air-crash/ |title= Boeing nearing 737 Max fleet bulletin on AoA warning after Lion Air crash |date= November 7, 2018 |work= The Air Current |author= Jon Ostrower}}</ref> \n* On November 7, 2018, the FAA issued an [[Emergency airworthiness directive]] requiring revising \"the {{abbr|AFM|aircraft flight manual}} to provide the flight crew with runaway horizontal stabilizer trim procedures\" when \"repeated nose-down trim commands\" are caused by \"an erroneously high single AOA sensor\".<ref>{{cite web| url= https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgad.nsf/0/83ec7f95f3e5bfbd8625833e0070a070/$FILE/2018-23-51_Emergency.pdf |title= Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-23-51 |date= November 7, 2018 |publisher= FAA}}</ref>\n* On December 3, 2018, the FAA conducted an unpublished \"Transport Aircraft Risk Assessment Methodology\u201d (TARAM) [[Boeing 737 MAX certification#Boeing 737 safety analysis|analysis]] that concluded, \"if left uncorrected, the MCAS design flaw in the 737 Max could result in as many as 15 future fatal crashes over the life of the fleet\u201d;

Accidents -->\n<section begin=\"summary\" />\nIn March 2019, [[National aviation authority|aviation authorities]] around the world [[Aircraft on ground|grounded]] the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] passenger [[airliner]] after two new 737 MAX aircraft crashed within five months, killing all 346 people aboard both flights, [[Lion Air Flight 610]] on October 29, 2018 and [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]] on March 10, 2019. Ethiopian Airlines grounded its remaining MAX fleet on March 10, day of the crash. On March 11, the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] ordered the first nationwide grounding, followed by most other regulators in quick succession. Meanwhile, the [[U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] asserted the MAX's [[Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community|continued airworthiness]] until it received new evidence of accident similarities on March 13. By March 18, all 387 airplanes, which served 8,600 flights each week for 59 airlines, were grounded worldwide. Boeing suspended deliveries to airlines, but produced another 400 aircraft before halting manufacturing in January 2020.\n\n<!-- 2. MCAS -->\nAfter the first accident, Boeing instructed pilots to follow an [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|existing procedure]] to recover from [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]] caused by a new flight control system, [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System]] (MCAS), which had been omitted from crew manuals and training. In a private analysis, the FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|predicted further accidents]] if MCAS was not revised, but believed that the [[emergency airworthiness directive]] would suffice until Boeing delivered a permanent solution.\n\n<!-- 3.  Aftermath: inquiries -->\nAfter the groundings, the [[U.S. Congress]], FBI and ad hoc panels began investigating FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|certification]] of the MAX, particularly the [[Organization Designation Authorization|delegation of authority]] that allowed Boeing to act on behalf of the FAA. Several [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Supporting systems|system and manufacturing defects]] were uncovered, in addition to problems with MCAS. Boeing eventually reversed its policy and recommended flight simulator training for all MAX pilots. The longest ever grounding for a U.S. airliner was estimated to cost Boeing $18.6 billion by March 2020.<!--ref name=Flight13mar2020-->\n\n<!-- 4.  Aftermath: final reports -->\nInvestigators published their findings on the first anniversaries of the accidents in October 2019 and March 2020. The Indonesian [[National Transportation Safety Committee|NTSC]] faulted airplane design, certification, maintenance, and flight crew actions. The Ethiopian [[Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority|ECAA]], which determined that the flight crew had attempted the recovery procedure, assigned blame to the aircraft's software design. The U.S. [[NTSB]] concluded that  malfunctions resulted in multiple cockpit alerts that likely confused the flight crews.
