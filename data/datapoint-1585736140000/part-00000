The school was founded in 1959 by Dr. [[Geoffrey William Griffin]], [[State Commendations of Kenya|MBS]], [[OBE]], Geoffrey Gatama Geturo and Joseph Kamiru Gikubu.<ref>Anthem of Bugles: The story of Starehe Boys Centre and School by Roger Martin</ref> It started as a rescue centre in Nairobi. Starehe and Brookhouse School are the only African schools south of the [[Sahara]] and north of the [[Limpopo]] distinguished as [[Round Square]] members.\n\n==Status==\nStarehe Boys' Centre and School educates at least 70% of its students free, and the rest at a reduced rate. This stems from its founding charter as a charitable school. School fees are paid on a means-tested basis, with substantial subsidies paid by the school, so that students from all walks of life are able to have a public school education that would otherwise be beyond their means.\n\nThe entrance process uses results from the national [[KCPE]] exams and prefers to award school places to those who show academic potential.\n\nThe school is governed by a Managing Committee chaired by Jimmy Mugerwa, Country Chairman of Kenya [[Shell and BP]], the school's main sponsors since its inception.\n\n===Admissions===\nAdmission of students is by open competitive examination. Each year about 20,000 applications are received; only 250 are selected to join the student body and about 6 places are left for very needy situations where the applicant might not have found a chance to apply but is still merited.\n\nCandidates are judged according to need and parental income and their performance in the national [[KCPE]] examinations. Selection is solely on merit.\n\n==History==\nStarehe Boys' Centre was the result of the vision of [[Geoffrey William Griffin]], assisted by [[Joseph Kamiru Gikubu|Joseph Gikubu]], and [[Geoffrey Gatama Geturo|Geoffrey Geturo]]. Its genesis was the earlier [[State of Emergency]] declared by the Governor of Colonial Kenya during the 1952 [[Mau Mau Uprising]] and the resultant overflow on to the streets of poor and destitute Mau Mau orphans.\n\nThe first 17 boys entered the school from [[Kariokor]] Rescue Centre, [[Nairobi]], and it was established in two tin huts donated by Kenya [[Shell and BP]] in 1959. After a few months it moved to its current location at [[Starehe]], Nairobi.\n\nThe name \"Starehe\" is Swahili for 'Tranquility', 'Peace', or 'Comfort', signifying a place where orphaned boys could find solace in its humble beginnings. It is also the name of the place in which the institution is situated.\n\nThe school is a member of the international [[Round Square (educational organisation)|Round Square]] school organisation, offering education to children from diverse backgrounds, many of whom are poor.\n\n==Traditions==\nThe [[school uniform]] is blue [[short trousers]] and red shirt, worn with a black tie and [[blazer]] or wind-breaker.\n\nLinks with the country and the community are maintained, with a monthly vacation spent in voluntary service to the community, either in hospitals, clinics, dispensaries or government offices, or any other institution that the students deem fit. This is referred to as the Voluntary Service Scheme, and is a way of giving back to society.\n\nStarehe hosts an annual football grudge match against [[Lenana School]] immediately before Founders' Day Dinner.\n\n==Accommodation==\nStudents take 'githeri' (mixture of beans and maize), a staple of the school since its inception. Starehe's education places emphasis on academic excellence as well as duty and discipline.<ref>Teaching Beyond Teaching: Dr. Geoffrey William Griffin and Starehe Boys Centre and School&nbsp;\u2013 by Peter Otiato Ojiambo</ref> An inscription at the Assembly Hall entrance reads \"the path of Duty is the way to Glory\".\n\nStudents perform daily duties that include cleaning their dormitories and the school compound as well as classes and laboratories. These duties are assigned and supervised by the prefects.\n\n==Discipline==\nStarehe follows a rank-based prefect system. A student may become a prefect from the second year at the school but never are full prefects. They only bear the rank of sub-prefect and are so confirmed during assembly where the Director announces their promotion. Promotion through the ranks is assessed by School Prefects (normally referred to as House Captains), who form the Cabinet of the School. Any potential prefect is vetted by the Cabinet, which consists of the School Prefects, the School Captains and the Director.\n\nCommoners are divided according to year. Those in Form One and Two are Junior Boys, Form Three and Four are Senior boys. Starehe also has a technical training institute called Starehe Technical Training Institute for post Secondary education. Starehe Institute students are referred to as \"collegers\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stareheboyscentre.ac.ke/sbc/school-info/admissions/admission-to-institute/|title=Institute \u2013 Starehe Boys Centre|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] was legal in Kenya, only the Director was allowed to use the [[caning|cane]] at Starehe.
