As a result, the school became known as the Academies at Anacostia and was split into four separate academies. In 2009-10, there were two ninth-grade academies (Sojourner Truth and Charles Drew), one 10-12th grade academy (Frederick Douglass) and one academy for under-credited and overage students (Matthew Henson).

In 2011-12, Sojourner Truth and Charles Drew will expand to become 9-11th grades, while Frederick Douglass will only be seniors.
