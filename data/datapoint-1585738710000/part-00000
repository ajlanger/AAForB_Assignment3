This allows the endodontist to choose the most appropriate treatment option, allowing preservation and longevity of the tooth and surrounding tissues. Treatment options for an irreversibly inflamed pulp (irreversible pulpitis) include either extraction of the tooth or removal of the [[pulp (tooth)|pulp]].\n\nRemoving the infected/inflamed pulpal tissue enables the [[endodontist]] to help preserve the longevity and function of the tooth. The treatment option chosen involves taking into account the expected prognosis of the tooth, as well as the patient's wishes. A full history is required (which includes the patient's symptoms and medical history), along with a clinical examination (both inside and outside the mouth), and the use of diagnostic tests <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrotte P | title = Endodontics: Part 2 Diagnosis and treatment planning | language = En | journal = British Dental Journal | volume = 197 | issue = 5 | pages = 231\u20138 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15359316 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bdj.4811612 }}</ref>\n\nThere are several diagnostic tests that can aid in the diagnosis of the dental pulp and the surrounding tissues.\nThese include:\n* Palpation (this is where the tip of the root is felt from the overlying tissues to see if there is any swelling or tenderness present)\n* Mobility (this is assessing if there is more than normal movement of the tooth in the socket)\n* Percussion (TTP, tender to percussion; the tooth is tapped to see if there is any tenderness)\n* Transillumination (shining a light through the tooth to see if there are any noticeable fractures)\n* Tooth slooth (this is where the patient is asked to bite down upon a plastic instrument; useful if the patient complains of pain on biting as this can be used to localise the tooth)\n* Radiographs \n* [[Dental pulp test]]s\n\nIn the situation that a tooth is considered so threatened (because of decay, cracking, etc.) that future infection is considered likely or inevitable, a pulpectomy (removal of the pulp tissue) is advisable to prevent such infection.

The double flare is a procedure introduced by Fava where the canal is explored using a small file. Then canal is prepared in crown down manner using K-files then follows a \"step back\" preparation with 1&nbsp;mm increments with increasing file sizes. With early coronal enlargement, also described as \"three times technique\", apical canals are prepared after a working length assessment using an [[apex location|apex locator]]; then progressively enlarged with Gates Glidden drills (only [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|coronal]] and middle third).

In the balanced forces technique, the dentist inserts a file into the canal and rotates clockwise a quarter of a turn, engaging dentin, then rotates counter-clockwise half/ three-quarter of a revolution, applying pressure in an apical direction, shearing off tissue previously meshed. From the balanced forces stem two other techniques: the reverse balanced force (where GT instruments are rotated first anti-clockwise and then clockwise) and the gentler \"feed and pull\" where the instrument is rotated only a quarter of a revolution and moved coronally after an engagement, but not drawn out.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n=== Irrigation ===\n\nThe root canal is flushed with an irrigant.

The standard endodontic technique involves inserting a gutta-percha cone (a \"point\") into the cleaned-out root canal along with a sealing cement.<ref>{{cite book |last = Tronstad |first = Leif | name-list-format = vanc |title = Clinical Endodontics: A Textbook |year = 2008 |publisher = Thieme |isbn = 978-3-13-768103-8 }}</ref> Another technique uses melted or heat-softened gutta-percha which is then injected or pressed into the root canal passage(s). However, since gutta-percha shrinks as it cools, thermal techniques can be unreliable and sometimes a combination of techniques is used. Gutta-percha is [[Radiodensity|radiopaque]], allowing verification afterwards that the root canal passages have been completely filled and are without voids.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAn alternative filling material was invented in the early 1950s by Angelo Sargenti. Filling material has undergone several formulations over the years (N2, N2 Universal, RC-2B, RC-2B White), but all contain [[paraformaldehyde]]. The paraformaldehyde, when placed into the root canal, forms [[formaldehyde]], which penetrates and sterilizes the passage. The formaldehyde is then theoretically transformed into harmless water and carbon dioxide. According to some research, the outcome of this method is better than a root canal procedure performed with gutta-percha. There is, however, a lack of indisputable scientific studies according to the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Resin based root canal sealer.jpg|thumb|285x285px|Root canal sealer used to fill the spaces between the gutta-percha and the walls of root canal and between the gutta-percha cones]]\nIn rare cases, the paste, like any other material, can be forced past the root tip into the surrounding bone. If this happens, the formaldehyde will immediately be transformed into a harmless substance. Blood normally contains 2&nbsp;mg formaldehyde per liter and the body regulates this in seconds. The rest of an overfill will be gradually absorbed and the end result is normally good. In 1991, the ADA Council on Dental Therapeutics resolved that the treatment was \"not recommended\", and it is not taught in American dental schools.

Sometimes the abscess can be drained, antibiotics prescribed, and the procedure reattempted when inflammation has been mitigated. The tooth can also be unroofed to allow drainage and help relieve pressure.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nA root treated tooth may be eased from the occlusion as a measure to prevent tooth fracture prior to the cementation of a crown or similar restoration. Sometimes the dentist performs preliminary treatment of the tooth by removing all of the infected pulp of the tooth and applying a dressing and temporary filling to the tooth. This is called a pulpectomy. The dentist may also remove just the coronal portion of the dental pulp, which contains 90% of the nerve tissue, and leave intact the pulp in the canals. This procedure, called a \"pulpotomy\", tends to essentially eliminate all the pain. A [[pulpotomy]] may be a relatively definitive treatment for infected [[deciduous teeth|primary teeth]]. The pulpectomy and pulpotomy procedures aim to eliminate pain until the follow-up visit for finishing the root canal procedure. Further occurrences of pain could indicate the presence of continuing infection or retention of vital nerve tissue.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSome dentists may decide to temporarily fill the canal with [[calcium hydroxide]] paste in order to thoroughly sterilize the site.  This  strong [[Base (chemistry)|base]] is left in place for a week or more to disinfect and reduce inflammation in surrounding tissue, requiring the patient to return for a second or third visit to complete the procedure.

This is because the access made into the root canal system removes a significant amount of tooth structure. Molars and premolars are the primary teeth used in chewing and will almost certainly fracture in the future without cuspal coverage. Anterior teeth typically do not require full coverage restorations after a root canal procedure, unless there is extensive tooth loss from decay or for esthetics or unusual occlusion.  Placement of a crown or cusp-protecting cast gold covering is recommended also because these have the best ability to seal the treated tooth. There is insufficient evidence to assess the effects of crowns compared to conventional fillings for the <abbr>restoration</abbr> of root-filled teeth, decision of restoration should rely on the clinical experience of the practitioner and the preference of the patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sequeira-Byron P, Fedorowicz Z, Carter B, Nasser M, Alrowaili EF | title = Single crowns versus conventional fillings for the restoration of root-filled teeth | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 9 | pages = CD009109 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26403154 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009109.pub3 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/CD009109/ORAL_single-crowns-or-routine-fillings-restoration-root-filled-teeth }}</ref>  If the tooth is not perfectly sealed, the canal may leak, causing eventual failure. A tooth with a root canal treatment still has the ability to decay, and without proper home care and an adequate [[fluoride]] source the tooth structure can become severely decayed (often without the patient's knowledge since the nerve has been removed, leaving the tooth without any [[dental pain|pain]] perception). Thus, non-restorable [[dental caries|carious]] destruction is the main reason for extraction of teeth after root canal therapy, accounting for up to two-thirds of these extractions.<ref name=ZadikOOOOE /> Therefore, it is very important to have regular [[Dental radiography|X-rays]] taken of the root canal to ensure that the tooth is not having any problems that the patient would not be aware of.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n=== Endodontic retreatment ===\nEndodontic treatment may fail for many reasons: one common reason for failure is inadequate chemomechanical [[debridement]] of the root canal. This may be due to poor endodontic access, missed anatomy or inadequate shaping of the canal, particularly in the apical third of the root canal, also due to the difficulty of reaching the accessory canals which are minute canals that extend in from the pulp to the periodontium in a random direction. They are mostly found in the apical third of the root.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vertucci|first=Frank J. | name-list-format = vanc  |date=November 1984|title=Root canal anatomy of the human permanent teeth|journal=Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology|volume=58|issue=5|pages=589\u2013599|doi=10.1016/0030-4220(84)90085-9|pmid=6595621 |issn=0030-4220}}</ref>\n\nExposure of the obturation material to the oral environment may mean the gutta-percha is contaminated with oral bacteria. If complex and expensive restorative dentistry is contemplated then ideally the contaminated gutta percha would be replaced in a retreatment procedure to minimise the risk of failure.\n\nThe type of bacteria found within a failed canal may differ from the normal infected tooth. [[Enterococcus faecalis]] and/or other facultative enteric bacteria or [[Pseudomonas]] sp. are found in this situation.\n\nEndodontic retreatment is technically demanding; it can be a time-consuming procedure, as meticulous care is required by the [[dentist]]. Retreatment cases are typically referred to a specialist [[endodontist]]. Use of an [[operating microscope]] or other magnification may improve outcomes.\n\n== Instruments and equipment used ==\n{{See also|Endodontic files and reamers|Nickel titanium rotary file}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\n\nSince 2000 there have been great innovations in the art and science of root canal therapy. Dentists now must be educated on the current concepts in order to optimally perform a root canal procedure. Root canal therapy has become more automated and can be performed faster thanks in part to machine-driven rotary technology and more advanced root canal filling methods. Many root canal procedures are done in one dental visit which may last for around 1\u20132 hours. Newer technologies are available (e.g. cone-beam CT scanning) that allow more efficient, scientific measurements to be taken of the dimensions of the root canal, however, the use of CT scanning in endodontics has to be justified.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmc = 5730974|year = 2017|last1 = Shukla|first1 = S|title = Role of Cone Beam Computed Tomography in Diagnosis and Treatment Planning in Dentistry: An Update|journal = Journal of International Society of Preventive and Community Dentistry|volume = 7|issue = Suppl 3|pages = S125\u2013S136|last2 = Chug|first2 = A|last3 = Afrashtehfar|first3 = K.

The file segment may be left behind if an acceptable level of cleaning and shaping has already been completed and attempting to remove the segment would risk damage to the tooth. While potentially disconcerting to the patient, having metal inside of a tooth is relatively common, such as with metal posts, amalgam fillings, gold crowns, and porcelain fused to metal crowns. The occurrence of file separation depends on the narrowness, curvature, length, calcification and number of roots on the tooth being treated.

On a maxillary [[molar (tooth)|molar]], there is more than a 50% chance that the tooth has four canals instead of just three, but the fourth canal, often called a \"mesio-buccal 2\", tends to be very difficult to see and often requires special instruments and magnification in order to see it (most commonly found in first maxillary molars; studies have shown an average of 76% up to 96% of such teeth with the presence of an MB2 canal). This infected canal may cause a continued infection or \"flare-up\" of the tooth. Any tooth may have more canals than expected, and these canals may be missed when the root canal procedure is performed. Sometimes canals may be unusually shaped, making them impossible to clean and fill completely; some infected material may remain in the canal. Sometimes the canal filling does not fully extend to the apex of the tooth, or it does not fill the canal as densely as it should. Sometimes a tooth root may be perforated while the root canal is being treated, making it difficult to fill the tooth. The perforation may be filled with a root repair material, such as one derived from natural cement called [[mineral trioxide aggregate]] (MTA). A specialist can often re-treat failing root canals, and these teeth will then heal, often years after the initial root canal procedure.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nHowever, the survival or functionality of the endodontically treated tooth is often the most important aspect of endodontic treatment outcomes, rather than apical healing alone.<ref>{{Citation |vauthors = Friedman S, Mor C |title = The success of endodontic therapy: healing and functionality |journal = J Calif Dent Assoc |volume = 32 |issue = 6 |pages = 493\u2013503 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15344440 |postscript = . }}</ref>\nRecent studies indicate that substances commonly used to clean the root canal space incompletely sterilize the canal.<ref>{{Citation |year = 2004 |title = Molecular evaluation of residual endodontic microorganisms after instrumentation, irrigation and medication with either calcium hydroxide or Septomixine |journal = Oral Diseases |pages = 389\u2013397 |doi = 10.1111/j.1601-0825.2004.01015.x |author1 = G Tang |author2 = LP Samaranayake |author3 = H-K Yip |volume = 10 |issue = 6 |pmid = 15533217 }}</ref> A properly restored tooth following root canal therapy yields long-term success rates near 97%.

In the 1930s, this theory was discredited, but the theory was recently revived by a book entitled ''Root Canal Cover-Up Exposed'' which used the early discredited research, and further complicated by epidemiological studies which found correlations between periodontal disease and heart disease, strokes, and preterm births.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The book's author, George Meinig, has been a strong advocate against endodontic therapy for years; he has since lost his dental license for gross negligence and ''Root Canal Cover-Up Exposed'' has come under great criticism.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Bacteremia]] (bacteria in the bloodstream) can be caused by many everyday activities, e.g. brushing teeth, but may also occur after any dental procedure which involves bleeding.

The treatment option chosen involves taking into account the expected prognosis of the tooth, as well as the patient's wishes. A full history is required (which includes the patient's symptoms and medical history), along with a clinical examination (both inside and outside the mouth), and the use of diagnostic tests <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrotte P | title = Endodontics: Part 2 Diagnosis and treatment planning | language = En | journal = British Dental Journal | volume = 197 | issue = 5 | pages = 231\u20138 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15359316 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bdj.4811612 }}</ref>\n\nThere are several diagnostic tests that can aid in the diagnosis of the dental pulp and the surrounding tissues.\nThese include:\n* Palpation (this is where the tip of the root is felt from the overlying tissues to see if there is any swelling or tenderness present)\n* Mobility (this is assessing if there is more than normal movement of the tooth in the socket)\n* Percussion (TTP, tender to percussion; the tooth is tapped to see if there is any tenderness)\n* Transillumination (shining a light through the tooth to see if there are any noticeable fractures)\n* Tooth slooth (this is where the patient is asked to bite down upon a plastic instrument; useful if the patient complains of pain on biting as this can be used to localise the tooth)\n* Radiographs \n* [[Dental pulp test]]s\n\nIn the situation that a tooth is considered so threatened (because of decay, cracking, etc.) that future infection is considered likely or inevitable, a pulpectomy (removal of the pulp tissue) is advisable to prevent such infection.

The standard endodontic technique involves inserting a gutta-percha cone (a \"point\") into the cleaned-out root canal along with a sealing cement.<ref>{{cite book |last = Tronstad |first = Leif | name-list-format = vanc |title = Clinical Endodontics: A Textbook |year = 2008 |publisher = Thieme |isbn = 978-3-13-768103-8 }}</ref> Another technique uses melted or heat-softened gutta-percha which is then injected or pressed into the root canal passage(s). However, since gutta-percha shrinks as it cools, thermal techniques can be unreliable and sometimes a combination of techniques is used. Gutta-percha is [[Radiodensity|radiopaque]], allowing verification afterwards that the root canal passages have been completely filled and are without voids.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAn alternative filling material was invented in the early 1950s by Angelo Sargenti. Filling material has undergone several formulations over the years (N2, N2 Universal, RC-2B, RC-2B White), but all contain [[paraformaldehyde]]. The paraformaldehyde, when placed into the root canal, forms [[formaldehyde]], which penetrates and sterilizes the passage. The formaldehyde is then theoretically transformed into harmless water and carbon dioxide. According to some research, the outcome of this method is better than a root canal procedure performed with gutta-percha. There is, however, a lack of indisputable scientific studies according to the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Resin based root canal sealer.jpg|thumb|285x285px|Root canal sealer used to fill the spaces between the gutta-percha and the walls of root canal and between the gutta-percha cones]]\nIn rare cases, the paste, like any other material, can be forced past the root tip into the surrounding bone. If this happens, the formaldehyde will immediately be transformed into a harmless substance. Blood normally contains 2&nbsp;mg formaldehyde per liter and the body regulates this in seconds. The rest of an overfill will be gradually absorbed and the end result is normally good. In 1991, the ADA Council on Dental Therapeutics resolved that the treatment was \"not recommended\", and it is not taught in American dental schools.

Sometimes the abscess can be drained, antibiotics prescribed, and the procedure reattempted when inflammation has been mitigated. The tooth can also be unroofed to allow drainage and help relieve pressure.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nA root treated tooth may be eased from the occlusion as a measure to prevent tooth fracture prior to the cementation of a crown or similar restoration. Sometimes the dentist performs preliminary treatment of the tooth by removing all of the infected pulp of the tooth and applying a dressing and temporary filling to the tooth. This is called a pulpectomy. The dentist may also remove just the coronal portion of the dental pulp, which contains 90% of the nerve tissue, and leave intact the pulp in the canals. This procedure, called a \"pulpotomy\", tends to essentially eliminate all the pain. A [[pulpotomy]] may be a relatively definitive treatment for infected [[deciduous teeth|primary teeth]]. The pulpectomy and pulpotomy procedures aim to eliminate pain until the follow-up visit for finishing the root canal procedure. Further occurrences of pain could indicate the presence of continuing infection or retention of vital nerve tissue.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSome dentists may decide to temporarily fill the canal with [[calcium hydroxide]] paste in order to thoroughly sterilize the site.

This is because the access made into the root canal system removes a significant amount of tooth structure. Molars and premolars are the primary teeth used in chewing and will almost certainly fracture in the future without cuspal coverage. Anterior teeth typically do not require full coverage restorations after a root canal procedure, unless there is extensive tooth loss from decay or for esthetics or unusual occlusion.  Placement of a crown or cusp-protecting cast gold covering is recommended also because these have the best ability to seal the treated tooth. There is insufficient evidence to assess the effects of crowns compared to conventional fillings for the <abbr>restoration</abbr> of root-filled teeth, decision of restoration should rely on the clinical experience of the practitioner and the preference of the patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sequeira-Byron P, Fedorowicz Z, Carter B, Nasser M, Alrowaili EF | title = Single crowns versus conventional fillings for the restoration of root-filled teeth | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 9 | pages = CD009109 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26403154 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009109.pub3 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/CD009109/ORAL_single-crowns-or-routine-fillings-restoration-root-filled-teeth }}</ref>  If the tooth is not perfectly sealed, the canal may leak, causing eventual failure. A tooth with a root canal treatment still has the ability to decay, and without proper home care and an adequate [[fluoride]] source the tooth structure can become severely decayed (often without the patient's knowledge since the nerve has been removed, leaving the tooth without any [[dental pain|pain]] perception). Thus, non-restorable [[dental caries|carious]] destruction is the main reason for extraction of teeth after root canal therapy, accounting for up to two-thirds of these extractions.<ref name=ZadikOOOOE /> Therefore, it is very important to have regular [[Dental radiography|X-rays]] taken of the root canal to ensure that the tooth is not having any problems that the patient would not be aware of.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n=== Endodontic retreatment ===\nEndodontic treatment may fail for many reasons: one common reason for failure is inadequate chemomechanical [[debridement]] of the root canal. This may be due to poor endodontic access, missed anatomy or inadequate shaping of the canal, particularly in the apical third of the root canal, also due to the difficulty of reaching the accessory canals which are minute canals that extend in from the pulp to the periodontium in a random direction. They are mostly found in the apical third of the root.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vertucci|first=Frank J. | name-list-format = vanc  |date=November 1984|title=Root canal anatomy of the human permanent teeth|journal=Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology|volume=58|issue=5|pages=589\u2013599|doi=10.1016/0030-4220(84)90085-9|pmid=6595621 |issn=0030-4220}}</ref>\n\nExposure of the obturation material to the oral environment may mean the gutta-percha is contaminated with oral bacteria.

[[Enterococcus faecalis]] and/or other facultative enteric bacteria or [[Pseudomonas]] sp. are found in this situation.\n\nEndodontic retreatment is technically demanding; it can be a time-consuming procedure, as meticulous care is required by the [[dentist]].

The file segment may be left behind if an acceptable level of cleaning and shaping has already been completed and attempting to remove the segment would risk damage to the tooth. While potentially disconcerting to the patient, having metal inside of a tooth is relatively common, such as with metal posts, amalgam fillings, gold crowns, and porcelain fused to metal crowns. The occurrence of file separation depends on the narrowness, curvature, length, calcification and number of roots on the tooth being treated.

On a maxillary [[molar (tooth)|molar]], there is more than a 50% chance that the tooth has four canals instead of just three, but the fourth canal, often called a \"mesio-buccal 2\", tends to be very difficult to see and often requires special instruments and magnification in order to see it (most commonly found in first maxillary molars; studies have shown an average of 76% up to 96% of such teeth with the presence of an MB2 canal). This infected canal may cause a continued infection or \"flare-up\" of the tooth. Any tooth may have more canals than expected, and these canals may be missed when the root canal procedure is performed. Sometimes canals may be unusually shaped, making them impossible to clean and fill completely; some infected material may remain in the canal. Sometimes the canal filling does not fully extend to the apex of the tooth, or it does not fill the canal as densely as it should. Sometimes a tooth root may be perforated while the root canal is being treated, making it difficult to fill the tooth. The perforation may be filled with a root repair material, such as one derived from natural cement called [[mineral trioxide aggregate]] (MTA). A specialist can often re-treat failing root canals, and these teeth will then heal, often years after the initial root canal procedure.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nHowever, the survival or functionality of the endodontically treated tooth is often the most important aspect of endodontic treatment outcomes, rather than apical healing alone.<ref>{{Citation |vauthors = Friedman S, Mor C |title = The success of endodontic therapy: healing and functionality |journal = J Calif Dent Assoc |volume = 32 |issue = 6 |pages = 493\u2013503 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15344440 |postscript = . }}</ref>\nRecent studies indicate that substances commonly used to clean the root canal space incompletely sterilize the canal.<ref>{{Citation |year = 2004 |title = Molecular evaluation of residual endodontic microorganisms after instrumentation, irrigation and medication with either calcium hydroxide or Septomixine |journal = Oral Diseases |pages = 389\u2013397 |doi = 10.1111/j.1601-0825.2004.01015.x |author1 = G Tang |author2 = LP Samaranayake |author3 = H-K Yip |volume = 10 |issue = 6 |pmid = 15533217 }}</ref> A properly restored tooth following root canal therapy yields long-term success rates near 97%.

This was called the \"[[focal infection theory]]\", and it led some dentists to advocate [[dental extraction]]. In the 1930s, this theory was discredited, but the theory was recently revived by a book entitled ''Root Canal Cover-Up Exposed'' which used the early discredited research, and further complicated by epidemiological studies which found correlations between periodontal disease and heart disease, strokes, and preterm births.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The book's author, George Meinig, has been a strong advocate against endodontic therapy for years; he has since lost his dental license for gross negligence and ''Root Canal Cover-Up Exposed'' has come under great criticism.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Bacteremia]] (bacteria in the bloodstream) can be caused by many everyday activities, e.g. brushing teeth, but may also occur after any dental procedure which involves bleeding.
