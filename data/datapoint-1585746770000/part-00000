{"title_page": "Thomas de Mahy, Marquis de Favras", "text_new": "[[File:Marquisdefavras.jpeg|thumb|right|230px|Thomas de Mahy]]\n'''Thomas de Mahy, marquis de Favras''' (March 26, 1744 \u2013 February 19, 1790) was a [[France|French]] [[French nobility|aristocrat]] and supporter of the [[House of Bourbon]] during the [[French Revolution]]. Often seen as a martyr of the Royalist cause, Favras was executed for his part in \"planning against the people of France\" under the [[Louis XVIII of France|Comte de Provence]]. He is known for his [[last words]] \"I see that you have made three spelling mistakes\" upon the reading of his death sentence warrant.\n\n==Career==\n{{noref|section|date=November 2019}}\nBorn in Favras near [[Blois]], he belonged to an impoverished family whose nobility dated from the 12th century. At seventeen he was a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] of [[dragoon]]s, and saw some service in the closing campaign of the [[Seven Years' War]]. In 1772 he became a first [[lieutenant]] in the [[Swiss_Guards#Swiss_Guards_.28Gardes_Suisses.29|Swiss Guard]]s of King [[Louis XVI]]'s younger brother, the [[Louis XVIII|Comte de Provence]]. Unable to meet the expenses of his rank, which was equivalent to that of a [[colonel]] in the army, he retired in 1775.\n\nIn 1776, Favras married Victoria Hedwig Karoline, Princess of [[Anhalt-Bernburg|Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg]], whose mother, after being deserted by her husband [[Karl Louis, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym]] in 1749, had found refuge with her daughter in the house of [[Charles de Rohan, prince de Soubise]]. After his marriage, Favras went to [[Vienna]] to attempt the restitution of his wife's rights, and spent some time in [[Warsaw]]. In 1787 he was authorized to raise a \"patriotic legion\" to help the [[Dutch Republic]] against the [[Stadtholder]] [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]] and his [[Prussia]]n allies.\n\nReturning to [[Paris]] in 1789, he became involved in Royalist plans initiated by his former employer, the [[Louis XVIII of France|Comte de Provence]], to save the King and end the [[French Revolution]]. In order to finance this venture, Provence (using one of his gentlemen, the [[Claude de La Ch\u00e2tre|Comte de la Ch\u00e2tre]], as an intermediary) commissioned Favras to negotiate a loan of 2,000,000 [[French franc]]s from the bankers Schaumel and Sartorius.\n\n==Arrest, trial, and execution==\nIt was stated in a leaflet circulated throughout Paris on February 29th, 1789 that Favras had been hired by the [[Louis XVIII|Comte de Provence]] to organize an elaborate plot against the people of France. In this plot, the King, Queen and their children were to be rescued from the [[Tuileries Palace]] and spirited out of the country. Then the Comte de Provence was to be declared [[regent]] of the kingdom with absolute power. Simultaneously, a force of 30,000 soldiers was to encircle Paris. In the ensuing confusion, the city's three main liberal leaders ([[Jacques Necker]], the popular [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Finance Minister of France]], [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], the [[List of mayors of Paris|mayor of Paris]], and the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Marquis de La Fayette]], the commander of the city's new [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]]) were to be assassinated. Afterwards, the revolutionary city was to be starved into submission by cutting off its food supplies. As a consequence of the leaflet, Favras and his wife were arrested the next day, and imprisoned in the [[Prison de l'Abbaye|Abbaye Prison]]. Terrified of the consequences of the arrest, the Comte de Provence hastened to publicly disavow Favras, in a speech delivered before the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Commune of Paris]], and in a letter to the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]].\n\nA fortnight after the arrest, Favras and his wife were separated, and Favras was removed to the [[Grand Ch\u00e2telet]]. In the course of a trial that lasted nearly two months, witnesses disagreed about the facts concerning the case and evidence was lacking. Even [[Sylvain Mar\u00e9chal]], the anarchist editor of the republican newspaper ''R\u00e9volutions de Paris'', admitted that the evidence against Favras was insufficient. However, an armed attempt to free him by some Royalists on January 26, which was thwarted by La Fayette, aroused the suspicion of the Parisians, and on February 18, 1790, in spite of a notable defense plea, Favras was sentenced to be [[Hanging|hanged]].\n\nAfter he had previously implicated others in the conspiracy (most notably, the [[Louis-Alexandre de Launay, comte d'Antraigues|Comte d'Antraigues]]), Favras offered to give further information to the authorities on the plot's details and participants if reprieved but, denied that, refused to reveal more.<ref>{{cite web\n|date= 1837\n|last= Carlyle\n|first= Thomas\n|authorlink=Thomas Caryle\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L0gQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239&dq=offers+to+reveal+secrets,+if+they+will+save+him;+handsomely+declines+since+they+will+not;&source=bl&ots=5LESqW7-Gk&sig=t5_949dk-Ewb-fL6vzyhVMSXOPU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjTl9uRxqjPAhVEy2MKHRT2D1cQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=offers%20to%20reveal%20secrets%2C%20if%20they%20will%20save%20him%3B%20handsomely%20declines%20since%20they%20will%20not%3B&f=false\n|title= The French Revolution: A History\n|accessdate= September 24, 2016\n|quote=[Favras] offers to reveal secrets, if they will save him; handsomely declines since they will not....\n}}</ref> His sentence was carried out in the [[Place de l'H\u00f4tel-de-Ville \u2013 Esplanade de la Lib\u00e9ration|Place de Gr\u00e8ve]] the next day - a measure which was received with enthusiasm by members of the Parisian population, since it was the first instance when no distinction in the mode of execution was allowed between noble and commoner.
