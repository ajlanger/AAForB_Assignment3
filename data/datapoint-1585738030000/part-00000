{"title_page": "Educational inequality", "text_new": "'''Educational inequality''' is the unequal distribution of academic resources, including but not limited to; school funding, qualified and experienced teachers, books, and technologies to socially excluded [[communities]]. These communities tend to be historically disadvantaged and oppressed. More times than not, individuals belonging to these [[Marginalized group|marginalized]] groups are also denied access to the schools with abundant resources. Inequality leads to major differences in the educational success or efficiency of these individuals and ultimately suppresses [[social mobility|social]] and [[economic mobility]]. ''See Statistic sections for more information.'' \n\nMeasuring educational efficacy varies by country and even provinces/states within the country. Generally, grades, [[Grade point average|GPA]] scores, test scores, dropout rates, college entrance statistics, and college completion rates are used to measure educational success. These are measures of an individual's academic performance ability.  When determining what should be measured in terms of the educational success of an individual, many scholars and academics suggest that [[Grade point average|GPA]], test scores, and other measures of performance ability are not the only useful tools in determining efficacy.<ref name=\"Williams\"/> In addition to academic performance, attainment of learning objectives, acquisition of desired skills and competencies, satisfaction, persistence, and post-college performance should all be measured and accounted for when determining the educational success of individuals. Scholars argue that academic achievement is only the direct result of attaining learning objectives and acquiring desired skills and competencies. To accurately measure educational efficacy, it is imperative to separate academic achievement because it captures only a student's performance ability and not necessarily their learning or ability to effectively use what they have learned.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=York, Rankin, & Gibson|first=Travis T., Susan & Charles|year=2015|title=Defining and Measuring Academic Success|url=|journal=Practical Assessment, Research & Evaluation|volume= 20| issue = 5, March 2015|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nMuch of educational inequality is attributed to [[economic]] disparities that often falls along [[racial]] lines and much modern conversation about [[educational equity]] conflates the two, showing how they are inseparable from residential location and, more recently, language.<ref name=\"Lee and Orfield\">{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Chungmei|author2=Gary Orfield|title=Why Segregation Matters: Poverty and Educational Inequality|journal=The Civil Rights Project|year=2005|series=Harvard University|pages=1\u201347}}</ref> Educational inequality between white students and minority students continues to perpetuate [[social inequality|social]] and [[economic inequality]].<ref name=\"Williams\">Williams, Belinda, ed.

[[Middle class]] knowledge of norms and customs allows students with this background to better navigate the school system.<ref name=Gamoran />  Parents from this class and above also have social networks that prove to be more beneficial than networks based in lower classes. These connections may help students gain access to the right schools, activities, etc.<ref name=Gamoran />  Additionally, children from poorer families, who are often minorities, come from families that distrust institutions.<ref name=Gamoran /> America's history of racism and discrimination has created a perceived and/or existent ceiling on opportunities for many poor and minority citizens. This ceiling muffles academic inspirations and muffles growth.<ref name=Gamoran />\n\nThe recent and drastic increase of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] [[immigrants]] has created another major factor in educational inequality. As more and more students come from families where [[English language|English]] is not spoken at home, they often struggle with overcoming a language barrier in addition to simply learning subjects.<ref name=\"Lee and Orfield\" />  They more frequently lack assistance at home because it is common for the parents to not understand the work that is in English.<ref name=Farkas />\n\nFurthermore, research reveals summer months as crucial time for the educational development of children.

For example, in [[Nigeria]], children are socialized into their specific gender role as soon as their parents know their gender. Men are the preferred gender and are encouraged to engage in [[Computer education|computer]] and scientific learning while the women learn domestic skills. These gender roles are deep rooted within the state, however, with the increase of westernized education within Nigeria, there has been a recent increase in women having the ability to receive an equal education. There is still much to be changed, though. Nigeria still needs policies that encourage educational attainment for men and women based on merit, rather than gender.<ref name=\"Gender Equality in Nigeria\">{{cite journal|last1=Okonkowo|first1=Ejike|title=Attitude towards Gender Equality in South-eastern Nigerian Culture: Impact of Gender and Level of Education|journal=Gender & Behavior|date=Dec 2013|volume=11|issue=2|pages=5579\u20135585}}</ref><br />\n<br />\nFemales are shown to be at risk of being attacked in at least 15 countries.<ref name=\"Girls edu Brookings\" /> Attacks can occur because individuals within those countries do not believe women should receive an education.

Dropout rates for males has also increased over the years in all racial groups, especially in [[African Americans]]. They have exceeded the number of high school and college dropout rates than any other racial ethnicity for the past 30 years.  A majority of the research found that males were primarily the most \"left behind\" in education because of higher graduation dropout rates, lower test scores, and failing grades. They found that as males get older, primarily from ages 9 to 17, they are less likely to be labeled \"proficient\" in reading and mathematics than girls were.\n\nIn general, males arrive in [[kindergarten]] much less ready and prepared for schooling than females. This creates a gap that continually increases over time into middle and high school. Nationally, there are 113 boys in 9th grade for every 100 girls, and among African American males, there are 123 boys for every 100 girls.

Educational facilities did not follow the federal mandate, in a studies through taken from 1890 to 1950 of Southern States per pupil expenditures (1950s dollars) on instruction varied from Whites to Blacks.

Children who come from a household that contains at least one immigrant parent, are less likely to attend childhood or preschool programs.<ref name=Bradeck/>\n\n===College preparation===\n\nThe preparation of college access to children born in America from immigrant parents pertaining to Latino communities is a complex process. The beginning of junior year through senior year in high school consists of preparation to college research and application process. For government help towards college tuition such as Financial Aid and Taps, parents or guardian's personal information is needed, this is where doubt and anticipation unravels. Majority of immigrant parents/guardians do not have most of the qualifications required for the application. The focus is to portray the way immigrants and their American born child work around the education system to attain college education.\nDue to the influx of the Latino population, there amount of Latino high school students graduates has increased as well.<ref name=\"Snyder2012\">Snyder, T.

Federal Student Aid comes from the federal government in which helps a student pay for educational expenses of college in three possible formats, grant, work-study, and loan. One step of the Federal Aid application requires one or both parent/guardian personal information as well as financial information. This may limit the continuance of the application due to the fear of providing personal information. The chances of young teens entering college reduces when personal information from parents are not given.\nMany young teens with immigrant parents are part of the minority group in which income is not sufficient to pay college tuition or repay loans with interest. The concept of college as highly expensive makes Latino students less likely to attend a four-year institution or even attend postsecondary education. Approximately 50% of Latinos received financial aid in 2003\u20132004, but they are still the minority who received the lowest average of federal award.<ref name=Excelencia >Excelencia in Education.

In the United States, the two examinations that are normally taken are the SATs and ACTs. Latino students do generally take the exam, but from 2011 to 2015, there has been a 50% increase in the number of Latino students taking the ACTs.<ref>ACT. (2015).

Some factors that are commonly included are [[demographics]], community atmosphere, school and family resources, dropout rates, spending per student, and family traits such as parental education. Currently, these, and other dimensions, are broadly grouped into two categories, \"available resources\" and \"investment decisions\". They each have their own effects, but also may cause and reinforce each other's existence.<ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" />\n\n==== School resources ====\nIn the same way some regions of the world have so called \"[[brain drain]]\", or the loss of wealthy, skilled, and educated individuals and their families to other countries through immigration, rural and inner city regions of the United States experience brain drain to sub-urban regions.<ref name=\"McGranahan 1980\">{{Cite journal|last=McGranahan|first=David A.|date=1980|title=The Spatial Structure of Income Distribution in Rural Regions|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=45|issue=2|pages=313\u2013324|doi=10.2307/2095128|jstor=2095128}}</ref><ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" /> It has been shown that people become more likely to leave rural areas as their education level increases and less likely as they increase in age.<ref name=\"McGranahan 1980\" /> Urban inner city areas have been decentralizing since the 1950s, losing their human capital. This flight of human capital leaves only the poor and disadvantaged behind to contribute to school funding resulting in school systems that have very limited resources and financial difficulty.<ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" />\n\nThe [[Education in the United States|American public school system]] is one in which the amount of wealth in a school district shapes the quality of the school because schools are primarily funded by local property taxes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Condron|first1=Dennis|title=Disparities Within: Unequal Spending and Achievement in an Urban School District|journal=Sociology of Education|date=2003|volume=76|issue=1|pages=18\u201336|doi=10.2307/3090259|jstor=3090259|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/12b420d16a67f543d0a8e5c8a7302ba17b7b9ee9}}</ref> As the school system's funding decreases, they are forced to do more with less. This frequently results in decreased [[student faculty ratio]]s and increased class sizes. Many schools are also forced to cut funding for the arts and enrichment programs which may be vital to academic success. Additionally, with decreased budgets, access to specialty and advanced classes for students who show high potential frequently decreases. A less obvious consequence of financial difficulty is difficulty in attracting new teachers and staff, especially those who are experienced.<ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" />\n\n==== Family resources ====\nIt has been shown that the socioeconomic status of the family has a large correlation with both the academic achievement and attainment of the student. \"The income defecate for inner city students is approximately $14,000 per year and $10,000 per year for the families of those living in the respective areas compared to the average income of families in sub-urban areas.\"<ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" /> Though, even within rural areas, there are differences in education and job choisis respective to demographics.<ref name=\"McGranahan 1980\" />\n\nMore well off sub-urban families can afford to spend money on their children's education in forms such as: private school, private tutoring, home lessons, and increased access to educational materials such as computers, books, educational toys, shows, and literature.<ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" />\n\nSub-urban families are also frequently able to provide larger amounts of [[social capital]] to their kids, such as increased use of \"proper English\", exposure to plays and museums, and familiarity with music, dance, and other such programs. Even more, inner city students are more likely to come from single parent homes and rural students are more likely to have siblings than their sub-urban peers decreasing the amount of investment per child their families are able to afford. This notion is called ''resource dilution'' which posits that families have finite levels of resources, such as time, energy and money. When sibship (amount of siblings) increases, resources for each child becomes diluted.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Downey|first1=Douglas|title=When Bigger is Not Better: Family Size, Parental Resources, and Children's Educational Performance|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1995|volume=60|issue=5|pages=746\u2013761|doi=10.2307/2096320|jstor=2096320|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/42fe8bd7ffe7a1a767b6172fcd3f8c999e457108}}</ref><ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" />\n\n==== Investment decisions ====\nEven if families and schools have the same resources available to them, that doesn't mean they will use them in the same way, or to the same extent. Often, people need proof that there is a connection between investing resources and academic success before they do it. Investment decisions are a function of both resources available and political processes, in regards to distribution of public funds.\n\n===== To the family =====\nThe investment a family puts into their child's education is largely reflective of the value the parent puts on education. The value placed on education is largely a combination of the parent's education level and the visual returns on education in the community the family lives in.\n\nSub-urban families tend to have parents with a much larger amount of education than families in rural and inner city locations. This allows sub-urban parents to have personal experience with returns on education as well as familiarity with educational systems and processes. In addition, parents can invest and transmit their own cultural capital to their children by taking them to museums, enrolling them in [[extracurricular activity|extra-curriculars]] or even having educational items in the house. In contrast, parents from rural and urban areas tend to have less education and little personal experience with its returns. The areas they live in also put very little value on education and reduce the incentive to gain it. This leads to families that could afford to invest greater resources in their children's education not to.<ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" />\n\n===== To the school =====\nIn the same way that a region or community that places little value on education may decrease a parent's willingness to invest in the education of their children, that community can reduce a school's willingness to allocate funding to provide advanced and in depth educational opportunities for its students. [[School board]]s tend to invest resources in response to the demands of the community, and their communities values have been changed due to the \"brain drain\" mentioned previously.\n\n==Gifted and talented education==\nThere is a disproportionate percentage of middle and upper-class White students labeled as [[Gifted student|gifted]] and talented compared to lower-class, minority students.<ref name=Banks>{{cite book|last1=Banks|first1=James|title=Multicultural Education: Issues and Perspectives|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|chapter=1}}</ref>  Similarly, [[Asian American]] students have been over-represented in gifted education programs.<ref name=Ford>{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Donna|title=The Underrepresentation of Minority Students in Gifted Education: Problems and Promises in Recruitment and Retention|journal=The Journal of Special Education|date=1998|volume=32|issue=1|pages=4\u201314|doi=10.1177/002246699803200102}}</ref>  In 1992, African Americans were underrepresented in gifted education by 41%, Hispanic American students by 42%, and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] by 50%.  Conversely, White students were over-represented in gifted education programs by 17% and Asian American minority students being labeled as gifted and talented, but research shows that there is a growing [[racial achievement gap in the United States|achievement gap between white students and students of color]].  There is also a growing gap between gifted students from low-income background and higher-income background.<ref name=NAGC>{{cite web|title=Including diverse learners in gifted education programs and services|url=http://www.nagc.org/resources-publications/resources/timely-topics/including-diverse-learners-gifted-education-programs|website=National Association for Gifted Children|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref>  The reasons for the under-representation of African American, Hispanic American, and American Indian students in gifted and talented programs can be explained by (a) recruitment issues/screening and identifying; and (b) personnel issues.<ref name=Ford />  In regards to screening and identifying gifted and talented students, most states use a standardized achievement and aptitude test, which minority students have a history of performing poorly on.  Arguments against standardized tests claim that they are culturally biased, favoring White students, require a certain mastery of the English language, and can lack cultural sensitivity in terms of format and presentation.<ref name=Ford />  In regards to personnel issues, forty-six states use teacher nominations, but many teachers are not trained in identifying or teaching gifted students.  Teachers also tend to have lower expectations of minority students, even if they are identified as gifted.  Forty-five states allow for parental nominations, but the nomination form is not sensitive to cultural differences and minority parents can have difficulty understanding the form. Forty-two states allow self nomination, but minority students tend not to self nominate because of social-emotional variables like peer pressure or feeling isolated or rejected by peers.<ref name=Ford />  Additionally, some students are identified as gifted and talented simply because they have parents with the knowledge, political skills, and power to require schools to classify their child as gifted and talented.  Therefore, providing their child with special instruction and enrichment.<ref name=Banks/>  Schools should make sure that students from all social-class, cultural, language, and ethnic groups have an equal opportunity to participate in gifted and talented programs.<ref name=Banks/>\n\n===Recommendations===\nThere are many recommendations for recruiting and retaining minority students in gifted and talented education programs.  It is important that the instruments used to screen students are valid, reliable, and sensitive to students from diverse cultural backgrounds.  There should also be multiple types ([[quantitative research|quantitative]], [[qualitative research|qualitative]], [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], [[subjectivity|subjective]]) and sources (teachers, parents, students) of information used in the screening process.<ref name=Ford />  Minority students who come from less rigorous schools and classrooms should be provided with support services and educational opportunities to help them be successful.  An example would be classes that focus on study skills or time management skills.<ref name=Ford />  Teachers should attend professional development opportunities and be trained in teaching and working with minority students.  More specifically, teachers should attend professional development that addresses the characteristics and behaviors of underrepresented gifted populations, awareness of cultural differences, children with multiple exceptionalities, developing positive peer culture in the classroom and school, and equitable and unbiased assessments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Classroom Instruction and Teacher Training for Gifted Students from Diverse Populations|url=http://www.nagc.org/resources-publications/resources/timely-topics/ensuring-diverse-learner-participation-gifted-1|website=National Association for Gifted Children|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref>  There should also be an increase in family involvement in the classroom and school, along with family involvement in the screening process.<ref name=Ford /> It is important to implement programs to keep students in school as they come of age and need to work so they can provide for their family. These programs should help students stay in school and provide a path to a career instead of having to go to work when they are old enough, which is a major barrier students of low income families face.\n\n==Special education==\nIn addition to the unbalanced scale of gender disproportionality in formal education, students with \"[[special needs]]\" comprise yet another facet of educational inequality.  Prior to the 1975 passing of the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] (currently known as the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA)) approximately 2 million children with special needs were not receiving sufficient public education.  Of those that were within the academic system, many were reduced to lower standards of teaching, isolated conditions, or even removal from school buildings altogether and relocated out of peer circulation.<ref name=Losen>{{cite book|last1=Losen|first1=Daniel J|last2=Orfield|first2=Gary|title=Racial Inequality in Special Education|date=2002|publisher=Harvard Education Press}}</ref> The passing of this bill effectively changed the lives of millions of special needs students, ensuring that they have free access to quality public education facilities and services.  And while there are those that benefit from the turning of this academic tide, there are still many students (most of which are minorities with disabilities) that find themselves in times of learning hardship due to the unbalanced distribution of special education funding.\n\nIn 1998 1.5 million minority children were identified with special learning needs in the US, out of that 876,000 were [[African Americans|African American]] or [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]].  [[African Americans|African American]] students were 3 times as likely to be labeled as special needs than that of [[White people|Caucasians]].  Students who both are special education students and of a minority face unequal chances for a quality education to meet their personal needs.  Special education referrals are, in most cases in the hands of the general education teacher, this is subjective and because of differences, disabilities can be overlooked or unrecognized.  Poorly trained teachers at minority schools, poor school relationships, and poor parent-to-teacher relationships play a role in this inequality.  With these factors, minority students are at a disadvantage because they are not given the appropriate resources that would in turn benefit their educational needs.<ref name=Losen />\n\n[[US Department of Education]] data shows that in 2000\u20132001 at least 13 states exhibited more than 2.75% of African American students enrolled in public schools with the label of \"[[mental retardation]]\". At that time national averages of caucasians labeled with the same moniker came in at 0.75%.  During this period no Individual state rose over 2.32% of caucasian students with special needs.<ref name=Losen />\n\nAccording to Tom Parrish, a senior research analyst with the [[American Institutes for Research]], African American children are 2.88 times more likely to be labeled as \"mentally retarded\", and 1.92 times more likely to be labeled as emotionally disturbed than Caucasian children.  This information was calculated by data gathered from the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]].<ref name=Losen />  It illustrates how even within a system that has progressed so much over the years, specifically due to industry recognition and public attention in forms such as government and private funding, aspects as archaic as race discrimination are still prevalent within these institutional walls.\n\nResearchers Edward Fierros and [[James Conroy (researcher)|James Conroy]], in their study of district level data regarding the issue of minority over-representation, have suggested that many states may be mistaken with their current projections and that disturbing minority based trends may be hidden within the numbers.  According to the Individuals with [[Disability discrimination act|Disabilities Act]] students with special needs are entitled to facilities and support that cater to their individual needs, they should not be automatically isolated from their peers or from the benefits of general education.  However, according to Fierros and Conroy, once minority children such as African Americans and Latinos are labeled as students with special needs they are far less likely than caucasians to be placed in settings of inclusive learning and often receive less desirable treatment overall.<ref name=Losen />\n\nThis problem of [[racial segregation]] amongst minority students with special needs is an ongoing battle in need of resolution.  While historically there has been no ironclad solution to righting the wrongs of racial prejudices, there are ways in which we can all individually begin the process of equality within our educational institutions.  Organizations such as the US Department of Education provide resources that we as teachers, students, parents, and concerned individuals can utilize in order to better educate ourselves on the current issues and services regarding special needs education.  One such resource is the [[Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services|Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS)]] which provides links to currently debated topics, programs, initiatives, reports and resources as well support services.<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/index.html|website=US Department of Education}}</ref>\n\n== History of educational oppression ==\n\n===United States of America (US)===\n{{main|Educational inequality in the United States}}\nThe historical relationships in the United States between privileged and marginalized communities' play a major role in the administering of unequal and inadequate education to these socially excluded communities. The belief that certain communities in the United States were inferior in comparison to others has allowed these disadvantages to foster into the great magnitude of educational inequality that we see apparent today.\n\nFor African Americans, deliberate systematic education oppression dates back to enslavement, more specifically 1740. In 1740, North Carolina passed legislation that prohibited [[Education during the Slave Period|slave education]]. While the original legislature prohibited African Americans from being taught how to write, as other States adopted their own versions of the law, southern anti-literacy legislatures banned far more than just writing. Varying Southern laws prohibited African Americans from learning how to read, write, and assembling without the presence of slave owners. Many states as far as requiring free African Americans to leave in fear of them educating their enslaved brethren. By 1836, the public education of all African-Americans was strictly prohibited.\n\nThe enslavement of African Americans removed the access to education for generations.<ref name=\"Ladson-Billings\">{{cite journal|last=Ladson-Billings|first=Gloria|year=2006|title=From Achievement Gap to the Education Debt: Understanding Achievement in U.S. Schools|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=35|issue=7|series=AERA Presidential Address|pages=1\u201311|doi=10.3102/0013189x035007003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6066ab224addbc2fae64eea81391842c5b003827}}</ref>  Once the legal abolishment of slavery was enacted, racial stigma remained. Social, economic, and political barriers held blacks in a position of subordination.<ref name=\"Gamoran\" /> Although legally African Americans had the ability to be learning how to read and write, they were often prohibited from attending schools with White students. This form of segregation is often referred to as ''de jure'' segregation.<ref name=\":0\" /> The schools that allowed African American students to attend often lacked financial support, thus providing inadequate educational skills for their students. Freedmen's schools existed but they focused on maintaining African Americans in servitude, not enriching academic prosperity.<ref name=\"Ladson-Billings\" />  The United States then experienced legal separation in schools between whites and blacks. Schools were supposed to receive equal resources but there was an undoubted inequality. It was not until 1968 that Black students in the South had universal secondary education.<ref name=\"Ladson-Billings\" /> Research reveals that there was a shrinking of [[racial achievement gap in the United States|inequality between racial groups]] from 1970\u20131988, but since then the gap has grown again.<ref name=\"Williams\" /><ref name=\"Ladson-Billings\" />\n\nLatinos and American Indians experienced similar educational repression in the past, which effects are evident now. Latinos have been systematically shut out of educational opportunities at all levels. Evidence suggests that Latinos have experienced this educational repression in the United States as far back as 1848.<ref name=\"Ladson-Billings\" /> Despite the fact that it is illegal to not accept students based on their race, religion, or ethnicity, in the Southwest of the United States Latinos were often segregated through the deliberate practice of school and public officials.

In addition to the resources from family mentioned earlier, access to proper nutrition and health care influence the cognitive development of children.<ref name=Greenstone /> Children who come from poor families experience this inequality, which puts them at a disadvantage from the start. Not only important are resources students may or may not receive from family, but schools themselves vary greatly in the resources they give their students. On December 2, 2011, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] released that school districts are unevenly distributing funds, which are disproportionately underfunding low-income students.<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/12/educational_inequality.html|title=The Persistence of Educational Inequality|last=Brown|first=Cynthia G.|work=Center for American Progress|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref> This is holding back money from the schools that are in great need. High poverty schools have less-qualified teachers with a much higher turnover rate.<ref name=\"Lee and Orfield\" />  In every subject area, students in high poverty schools are more likely than other students to be taught by teachers without even a minor in their subject matter.<ref name=Haycock /> Better resources allows for the reduction of classroom size, which research has proven improves test scores.<ref name=Greenstone /> It also increases the number of after school and summer programs\u2014these are very beneficial to poor children because it not only combats the increased loss of skill over the summer but keeps them out of unsafe neighborhoods and combats the drop-out rate.<ref name=Greenstone />  There is also a difference in the classes offered to students, specifically advanced mathematics and science courses.  In 2012, Algebra II was offered to 82% of the schools (in diverse districts) serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students,  while only 65% of the schools serving the most African American and Hispanic students offered students the same course.  [[Physics]] was offered to 66% of the schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, compared to 40% serving the most.  [[Calculus]] was offered to 55% of the schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, compared to 29% serving the most.<ref name=CRDC />\n\nThis lack of resources is directly linked to ethnicity and race. Black and Latino students are three times more likely than whites to be in high poverty schools and twelve times as likely to be in schools that are predominantly poor.<ref name=\"Lee and Orfield\" />  Also, in schools that are composed of 90% or above of minorities, only one half of the teachers are certified in the subjects they teach.<ref name=Haycock />  As the number of white students increase in a school, funding tends to increase as well.<ref name=Ladson-Billings />  Teachers in elementary schools serving the most Hispanic and African-American students are paid on average $2250 less per year than their colleagues in the same district working at schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American Students.<ref name=CRDC /> From the family resources side, 10% of white children are raised in poverty, while 37% of Latino children are and 42% of African American children are.<ref name=Farkas /> Research indicates that when resources are equal, Black students are more likely to continue their education into college than their white counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Merolla|first=David|year=2013|title=The Net Black Advantage in Educational Transitions: An Educational Careers Approach|journal=American Educational Research Journal|volume=50|issue=5|pages=895\u2013924|doi=10.3102/0002831213486511}}</ref>\n\n===State conflicts===\nWithin [[fragile state]]s, children may be subject to inadequate education.

It is related to the \"rags to riches\" notion that anyone, with hard work and determination, has the ability to move upward no matter what background they come from.

One policy change that seems necessary to make is that quality child care is available to every child in the United States at an affordable rate. This has been scientifically proven to push students into college, and thus increase [[social mobility]]. The ultimate end result of such a reality would be that the widely stratified educational system that exists in the U.S. today would begin to equalize so that every child born, regardless of [[socioeconomic status]], would have the same opportunity to succeed. Many European countries are already exercising such successful educational systems.\n\n== Global evidence ==\n\n[[File:School children in Rhbat, Nagar.jpg|thumb|right|alt=School children in Rhbat, Nagar sit in classroom learning.

The country inherited class, race and gender inequality in the social, political, and economic spheres during the [[Apartheid]]. The 1994 constitution emphasizes higher education as useful for human resource development and of great importance to any economic and social transitions. However, they are still fighting to overcome the [[colonialism]] and racism in intellectual spaces.<ref name=\"Inequality South Africa\" />\n\nFunding from the government has a major stake in the educational quality received. As a result of declining government support, the average class size in South Africa is growing. The increased class size limits student-teacher interactions, therefore further hindering students with low problem solving and critical thinking skills. In an article by Meenal Shrivastava and Sanjiv Shrivastava, the argument is made that in large class sizes \u201chave ramifications for developing countries where higher education where higher education is a core element in the economic and societal development\u201d.

The government of Sudan recognizes education as a right for every citizen and guarantees access to free basic education, The educational structure of the Republic of the Sudan consists of the pre-primary, primary, secondary and higher education, The Sudanese education system includes more than 3.646 schools run by public, private, and religious providers, the schools are overseen by the High Ministry of Education. However, Sudan's simmering wars and a lack of awareness about the importance of education and chronic under-development all contribute to the poor schooling of girls in Sudan. In addition, cultural pressures and the traditional views of the role of women mean fewer girls attend and remain in school. The inability to pay fees even though school is free according to government policy is a major reason, some poor families can't afford the stationaries & clothes, also the government can't provide all the students needs because of the economic situation and poverty. However government has raised their awareness of educating females, and they published universities only for girls, the first and the most popular one is AL Ahfad University for Women, located in Omdurman, created in 1907 by Sheikh Babikr Bedri. now percentage of educated females are increasing within time, based on the last survey estimates that 60.8% of females in Sudan can read & write.\n\n=== United States of America (US) ===\n''See selected issues and criticisms under [[Higher education in the United States]].''[[File:Children in a classroom.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Children in a classroom in the United States.|Children in a classroom in the United States]]\n\n====Property tax dilemma====\nIn the United States, schools are funded by local property taxes.  Because of this, the more affluent a neighborhood, the higher the funding for that school district. Although this situation seems favorable, the problem emerges when the equation is reversed. In neighborhoods inhabited by predominantly working and lower-class families, properties are less expensive, and so property taxes are much lower than those in affluent neighborhoods. Consequently, funding for the school districts to which working and lower class children are assigned is also significantly lower than the funding for the school districts to which children of affluent families are assigned. Thus, students in working and lower class schools do not receive the same quality of education and access to resources as do students from affluent families. The reality of the situation is that distribution of resources for schools is based on the socioeconomic status of the parents of the students. As a result, the U.S. educational system significantly aids in widening the gap between the rich and the poor. This gap has increased, rather than decreased, over the past few decades due in part to a lack of [[social mobility]].<ref name=\"auto\">Leonhardt, D. (2005). Class matters: The college dropout boom.

Some ways that Sweden is accomplishing these goals is by making sure every child can go to daycare affordably. Of the total cost of childcare, parents pay no more than 18% for their child; the remaining 82% is paid for by various government agencies and municipalities. In 2002, a \"maximum-fee\" system was introduced in Sweden that states that costs for childcare may be no greater than 3% of one's income for the first child, 2% for the second child, 1% for the third child, and free of charge for the fourth child in pre-school. 97.5% of children age 1\u20135 attend these public daycare centers. Also, a new law was recently introduced that states that all four- and five-year-old children can attend day care for free.<ref name=\"auto6\">Bjornberg, U. & Dahlgren, L. Policy: The case of Sweden. University of York, United Kingdom. http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/spru/research/nordic/swedenpoli.pdf</ref> Since practically all students, no matter what their socioeconomic background, attend the same daycare centers, equalization alongside educational development begins early and in the public sphere. Furthermore, parental leave consists of 12 months paid leave (80% of wage) whereas one month is awarded solely to the father in the form of \"use it or lose it\". This results in the privilege and affordability of staying home and bonding with one's child for the first year of life. Due to this affordability, less than 200 children in the entire country of Sweden under the age of 1 are placed in child care.<ref name=\"auto5\">Clawson, D. & Gerstel, N. (2007). Caring for our young: Childcare in Europe and the United States. Ed. Ferguson, S.J. Shifting the center: Understanding contemporary families. 3rd Ed. McGraw Hill: Boston, MA</ref>\n\nStratification in the educational system is further diminished by providing all Swedish citizens and legal residents with the option of choosing which school they want their children to be placed in, regardless of what neighborhood they reside in or what property taxes they pay. Additionally, the Swedish government not only provides its citizens with a free college education, but also with an actual monthly allowance for attending school and college.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\nTogether, these privileges allow for all Swedish children to have access to the same resources. A similar system can be found in France, where free, full-day child care centers known as \"\u00e9coles maternelles\" enroll close to 100% of French children ages 3\u20135 years old. In Denmark, children from birth to age six are enrolled in childcare programs that are available at one-fifth the total costs, where the rest is covered by public funding.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[British birth cohort studies]]\n* [[Class stratification]]\n* [[Conflict theory]]\n* [[Educational psychology]]\n* [[Hidden curriculum]]\n* [[List of standardized tests in the United States]]\n* [[Social inequality]]\n* [[Socioeconomic status]]\n* [[Structural inequality in education]]\n* [[Working class education]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://gpseducation.oecd.org/revieweducationpolicies/#!node=41746&filter=all OECD's Education GPS, a review of education policy analysis and statistics: Equity]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Educational Inequality}}\n[[Category:Education issues]]\n[[Category:Discrimination]]\n[[Category:Social inequality]]\n[[Category:Race and education]]\n", "text_old": "'''Educational inequality''' is the unequal distribution of academic resources, including but not limited to; school funding, qualified and experienced teachers, books, and technologies to socially excluded [[communities]].

Generally, grades, [[Grade point average|GPA]] scores, test scores, dropout rates, college entrance statistics, and college completion rates are used to measure educational success. These are measures of an individual's academic performance ability.  When determining what should be measured in terms of the educational success of an individual, many scholars and academics suggest that [[Grade point average|GPA]], test scores, and other measures of performance ability are not the only useful tools in determining efficacy.<ref name=\"Williams\"/> In addition to academic performance, attainment of learning objectives, acquisition of desired skills and competencies, satisfaction, persistence, and post-college performance should all be measured and accounted for when determining the educational success of individuals. Scholars argue that academic achievement is only the direct result of attaining learning objectives and acquiring desired skills and competencies.

For example, in [[Nigeria]], children are socialized into their specific gender role as soon as their parents know their gender. Men are the preferred gender and are encouraged to engage in [[Computer education|computer]] and scientific learning while the women learn domestic skills. These gender roles are deep rooted within the state, however, with the increase of westernized education within Nigeria, there has been a recent increase in women having the ability to receive an equal education. There is still much to be changed, though.

They have exceeded the number of high school and college dropout rates than any other racial ethnicity for the past 30 years.  A majority of the research found that males were primarily the most \"left behind\" in education because of higher graduation dropout rates, lower test scores, and failing grades.

This was due to the post effects of the court case ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) where it was decided that educational facilities were allowed to segregate white students from students of color as long as the educational facilities were considered equal. Educational facilities did not follow the federal mandate, in a studies through taken from 1890 to 1950 of Southern States per pupil expenditures (1950s dollars) on instruction varied from Whites to Blacks. On average White students received 17\u201370 percent more educational expenditures than their Black counterparts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race and Schooling in the South, 1880\u20131950: An Economic History|last=Mago|first=Robert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-226-50510-7|location=|pages=21\u201322}}</ref> The first Federal legal challenge of these unequal segregated educational systems would occur in California ''[[Mendez v. Westminster]]'' in 1947 followed by ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' in 1954. The decision of ''Brown v. Board of Education'' would lead to the desegregation of schools by federal law, but the years of lower education, segregation of household salaries between whites and people of color, and [[racial wealth gap]]s would leave people of color at a disadvantage to seek proper equal education for generations to come.\n\nDifferences of academic skills in children of different race starts at an early age, according to [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] there is a remaining gap showing Black and Latino children being able to demonstrate cognitive proficiency compared to their White counterparts.

A study from New York showed that children of immigrant descent outperformed their native student counterparts. The paradox explains that the gratefulness of immigrant children allows them to enjoy academic advantages that may not have been accessible at one time. This in turn allows for more effort and better outcomes from these students. This was also evident in the National Education Longitudinal Study which showed that immigrant children many times outperformed on math and science tests. Grace Keo reported that \u201cevidence of the immigrant advantage was stronger from Asian immigrant families than for youth from Latin American\u201d, which may cause some inequality in itself.

Federal Student Aid comes from the federal government in which helps a student pay for educational expenses of college in three possible formats, grant, work-study, and loan. One step of the Federal Aid application requires one or both parent/guardian personal information as well as financial information. This may limit the continuance of the application due to the fear of providing personal information. The chances of young teens entering college reduces when personal information from parents are not given.\nMany young teens with immigrant parents are part of the minority group in which income is not sufficient to pay college tuition or repay loans with interest. The concept of college as highly expensive makes Latino students less likely to attend a four-year institution or even attend postsecondary education. Approximately 50% of Latinos received financial aid in 2003\u20132004, but they are still the minority who received the lowest average of federal award.<ref name=Excelencia >Excelencia in Education.

Studies have shown that low performance on standardized tests can have a negative effect on the funding the school receives from the government, and low-income students have been shown to underperform on standardized tests at higher rates than their peers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=Frank|date=2005|title=How do rural schools fare under a high-stakes testing regime?|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9778/6683b2a25e4ee65d69c892cea1016289f134.pdf#page=64|journal=Journal of Research in Rural Education|volume=20|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jennings|first=Jennifer|last2=Sohn|first2=Heeju|date=2014-04-01|title=Measure for Measure: How Proficiency-based Accountability Systems Affect Inequality in Academic Achievement|journal=Sociology of Education|language=en|volume=87|issue=2|pages=125\u2013141|doi=10.1177/0038040714525787|issn=0038-0407|pmc=4843844|pmid=27122642}}</ref> A study looking at how low test performance affected schools, found that schools that perform below average and are in low income areas can face repercussions that affect school funding and resources.<ref name=\"Herman 2005\">{{Cite journal|last=Herman|first=Joan L.|last2=Golan|first2=Shari|date=2005-10-25|title=The Effects of Standardized Testing on Teaching and Schools|journal=Educational Measurement: Issues and Practice|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=20\u201325|doi=10.1111/j.1745-3992.1993.tb00550.x|issn=0731-1745}}</ref> The study also found that the material taught to students is affected by test performance, as schools that have low test scores will often change their curriculum to teach to the test.<ref name=\"Herman 2005\" />\n\n===Spatial inequalities===\nWhen looking at spatial inequalities, it is important to look from multiple [[Point of view (philosophy)|points of view]]. Some factors that are commonly included are [[demographics]], community atmosphere, school and family resources, dropout rates, spending per student, and family traits such as parental education. Currently, these, and other dimensions, are broadly grouped into two categories, \"available resources\" and \"investment decisions\". They each have their own effects, but also may cause and reinforce each other's existence.<ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" />\n\n==== School resources ====\nIn the same way some regions of the world have so called \"[[brain drain]]\", or the loss of wealthy, skilled, and educated individuals and their families to other countries through immigration, rural and inner city regions of the United States experience brain drain to sub-urban regions.<ref name=\"McGranahan 1980\">{{Cite journal|last=McGranahan|first=David A.|date=1980|title=The Spatial Structure of Income Distribution in Rural Regions|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=45|issue=2|pages=313\u2013324|doi=10.2307/2095128|jstor=2095128}}</ref><ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" /> It has been shown that people become more likely to leave rural areas as their education level increases and less likely as they increase in age.<ref name=\"McGranahan 1980\" /> Urban inner city areas have been decentralizing since the 1950s, losing their human capital. This flight of human capital leaves only the poor and disadvantaged behind to contribute to school funding resulting in school systems that have very limited resources and financial difficulty.<ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" />\n\nThe [[Education in the United States|American public school system]] is one in which the amount of wealth in a school district shapes the quality of the school because schools are primarily funded by local property taxes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Condron|first1=Dennis|title=Disparities Within: Unequal Spending and Achievement in an Urban School District|journal=Sociology of Education|date=2003|volume=76|issue=1|pages=18\u201336|doi=10.2307/3090259|jstor=3090259|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/12b420d16a67f543d0a8e5c8a7302ba17b7b9ee9}}</ref> As the school system's funding decreases, they are forced to do more with less. This frequently results in decreased [[student faculty ratio]]s and increased class sizes. Many schools are also forced to cut funding for the arts and enrichment programs which may be vital to academic success. Additionally, with decreased budgets, access to specialty and advanced classes for students who show high potential frequently decreases. A less obvious consequence of financial difficulty is difficulty in attracting new teachers and staff, especially those who are experienced.<ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" />\n\n==== Family resources ====\nIt has been shown that the socioeconomic status of the family has a large correlation with both the academic achievement and attainment of the student. \"The income defecate for inner city students is approximately $14,000 per year and $10,000 per year for the families of those living in the respective areas compared to the average income of families in sub-urban areas.\"<ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" /> Though, even within rural areas, there are differences in education and job choisis respective to demographics.<ref name=\"McGranahan 1980\" />\n\nMore well off sub-urban families can afford to spend money on their children's education in forms such as: private school, private tutoring, home lessons, and increased access to educational materials such as computers, books, educational toys, shows, and literature.<ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" />\n\nSub-urban families are also frequently able to provide larger amounts of [[social capital]] to their kids, such as increased use of \"proper English\", exposure to plays and museums, and familiarity with music, dance, and other such programs. Even more, inner city students are more likely to come from single parent homes and rural students are more likely to have siblings than their sub-urban peers decreasing the amount of investment per child their families are able to afford. This notion is called ''resource dilution'' which posits that families have finite levels of resources, such as time, energy and money. When sibship (amount of siblings) increases, resources for each child becomes diluted.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Downey|first1=Douglas|title=When Bigger is Not Better: Family Size, Parental Resources, and Children's Educational Performance|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1995|volume=60|issue=5|pages=746\u2013761|doi=10.2307/2096320|jstor=2096320|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/42fe8bd7ffe7a1a767b6172fcd3f8c999e457108}}</ref><ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" />\n\n==== Investment decisions ====\nEven if families and schools have the same resources available to them, that doesn't mean they will use them in the same way, or to the same extent. Often, people need proof that there is a connection between investing resources and academic success before they do it. Investment decisions are a function of both resources available and political processes, in regards to distribution of public funds.\n\n===== To the family =====\nThe investment a family puts into their child's education is largely reflective of the value the parent puts on education. The value placed on education is largely a combination of the parent's education level and the visual returns on education in the community the family lives in.\n\nSub-urban families tend to have parents with a much larger amount of education than families in rural and inner city locations. This allows sub-urban parents to have personal experience with returns on education as well as familiarity with educational systems and processes. In addition, parents can invest and transmit their own cultural capital to their children by taking them to museums, enrolling them in [[extracurricular activity|extra-curriculars]] or even having educational items in the house. In contrast, parents from rural and urban areas tend to have less education and little personal experience with its returns. The areas they live in also put very little value on education and reduce the incentive to gain it. This leads to families that could afford to invest greater resources in their children's education not to.<ref name=\"Roscigno 2006\" />\n\n===== To the school =====\nIn the same way that a region or community that places little value on education may decrease a parent's willingness to invest in the education of their children, that community can reduce a school's willingness to allocate funding to provide advanced and in depth educational opportunities for its students. [[School board]]s tend to invest resources in response to the demands of the community, and their communities values have been changed due to the \"brain drain\" mentioned previously.\n\n==Gifted and talented education==\nThere is a disproportionate percentage of middle and upper-class White students labeled as [[Gifted student|gifted]] and talented compared to lower-class, minority students.<ref name=Banks>{{cite book|last1=Banks|first1=James|title=Multicultural Education: Issues and Perspectives|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|chapter=1}}</ref>  Similarly, [[Asian American]] students have been over-represented in gifted education programs.<ref name=Ford>{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Donna|title=The Underrepresentation of Minority Students in Gifted Education: Problems and Promises in Recruitment and Retention|journal=The Journal of Special Education|date=1998|volume=32|issue=1|pages=4\u201314|doi=10.1177/002246699803200102}}</ref>  In 1992, African Americans were underrepresented in gifted education by 41%, Hispanic American students by 42%, and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] by 50%.  Conversely, White students were over-represented in gifted education programs by 17% and Asian American minority students being labeled as gifted and talented, but research shows that there is a growing [[racial achievement gap in the United States|achievement gap between white students and students of color]].  There is also a growing gap between gifted students from low-income background and higher-income background.<ref name=NAGC>{{cite web|title=Including diverse learners in gifted education programs and services|url=http://www.nagc.org/resources-publications/resources/timely-topics/including-diverse-learners-gifted-education-programs|website=National Association for Gifted Children|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref>  The reasons for the under-representation of African American, Hispanic American, and American Indian students in gifted and talented programs can be explained by (a) recruitment issues/screening and identifying; and (b) personnel issues.<ref name=Ford />  In regards to screening and identifying gifted and talented students, most states use a standardized achievement and aptitude test, which minority students have a history of performing poorly on.  Arguments against standardized tests claim that they are culturally biased, favoring White students, require a certain mastery of the English language, and can lack cultural sensitivity in terms of format and presentation.<ref name=Ford />  In regards to personnel issues, forty-six states use teacher nominations, but many teachers are not trained in identifying or teaching gifted students.  Teachers also tend to have lower expectations of minority students, even if they are identified as gifted.  Forty-five states allow for parental nominations, but the nomination form is not sensitive to cultural differences and minority parents can have difficulty understanding the form. Forty-two states allow self nomination, but minority students tend not to self nominate because of social-emotional variables like peer pressure or feeling isolated or rejected by peers.<ref name=Ford />  Additionally, some students are identified as gifted and talented simply because they have parents with the knowledge, political skills, and power to require schools to classify their child as gifted and talented.  Therefore, providing their child with special instruction and enrichment.<ref name=Banks/>  Schools should make sure that students from all social-class, cultural, language, and ethnic groups have an equal opportunity to participate in gifted and talented programs.<ref name=Banks/>\n\n===Recommendations===\nThere are many recommendations for recruiting and retaining minority students in gifted and talented education programs.  It is important that the instruments used to screen students are valid, reliable, and sensitive to students from diverse cultural backgrounds.  There should also be multiple types ([[quantitative research|quantitative]], [[qualitative research|qualitative]], [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], [[subjectivity|subjective]]) and sources (teachers, parents, students) of information used in the screening process.<ref name=Ford />  Minority students who come from less rigorous schools and classrooms should be provided with support services and educational opportunities to help them be successful.  An example would be classes that focus on study skills or time management skills.<ref name=Ford />  Teachers should attend professional development opportunities and be trained in teaching and working with minority students.  More specifically, teachers should attend professional development that addresses the characteristics and behaviors of underrepresented gifted populations, awareness of cultural differences, children with multiple exceptionalities, developing positive peer culture in the classroom and school, and equitable and unbiased assessments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Classroom Instruction and Teacher Training for Gifted Students from Diverse Populations|url=http://www.nagc.org/resources-publications/resources/timely-topics/ensuring-diverse-learner-participation-gifted-1|website=National Association for Gifted Children|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref>  There should also be an increase in family involvement in the classroom and school, along with family involvement in the screening process.<ref name=Ford /> It is important to implement programs to keep students in school as they come of age and need to work so they can provide for their family. These programs should help students stay in school and provide a path to a career instead of having to go to work when they are old enough, which is a major barrier students of low income families face.\n\n==Special education==\nIn addition to the unbalanced scale of gender disproportionality in formal education, students with \"[[special needs]]\" comprise yet another facet of educational inequality.  Prior to the 1975 passing of the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] (currently known as the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA)) approximately 2 million children with special needs were not receiving sufficient public education.  Of those that were within the academic system, many were reduced to lower standards of teaching, isolated conditions, or even removal from school buildings altogether and relocated out of peer circulation.<ref name=Losen>{{cite book|last1=Losen|first1=Daniel J|last2=Orfield|first2=Gary|title=Racial Inequality in Special Education|date=2002|publisher=Harvard Education Press}}</ref> The passing of this bill effectively changed the lives of millions of special needs students, ensuring that they have free access to quality public education facilities and services.  And while there are those that benefit from the turning of this academic tide, there are still many students (most of which are minorities with disabilities) that find themselves in times of learning hardship due to the unbalanced distribution of special education funding.\n\nIn 1998 1.5 million minority children were identified with special learning needs in the US, out of that 876,000 were [[African Americans|African American]] or [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]].  [[African Americans|African American]] students were 3 times as likely to be labeled as special needs than that of [[White people|Caucasians]].  Students who both are special education students and of a minority face unequal chances for a quality education to meet their personal needs.  Special education referrals are, in most cases in the hands of the general education teacher, this is subjective and because of differences, disabilities can be overlooked or unrecognized.  Poorly trained teachers at minority schools, poor school relationships, and poor parent-to-teacher relationships play a role in this inequality.  With these factors, minority students are at a disadvantage because they are not given the appropriate resources that would in turn benefit their educational needs.<ref name=Losen />\n\n[[US Department of Education]] data shows that in 2000\u20132001 at least 13 states exhibited more than 2.75% of African American students enrolled in public schools with the label of \"[[mental retardation]]\". At that time national averages of caucasians labeled with the same moniker came in at 0.75%.  During this period no Individual state rose over 2.32% of caucasian students with special needs.<ref name=Losen />\n\nAccording to Tom Parrish, a senior research analyst with the [[American Institutes for Research]], African American children are 2.88 times more likely to be labeled as \"mentally retarded\", and 1.92 times more likely to be labeled as emotionally disturbed than Caucasian children.  This information was calculated by data gathered from the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]].<ref name=Losen />  It illustrates how even within a system that has progressed so much over the years, specifically due to industry recognition and public attention in forms such as government and private funding, aspects as archaic as race discrimination are still prevalent within these institutional walls.\n\nResearchers Edward Fierros and [[James Conroy (researcher)|James Conroy]], in their study of district level data regarding the issue of minority over-representation, have suggested that many states may be mistaken with their current projections and that disturbing minority based trends may be hidden within the numbers.  According to the Individuals with [[Disability discrimination act|Disabilities Act]] students with special needs are entitled to facilities and support that cater to their individual needs, they should not be automatically isolated from their peers or from the benefits of general education.  However, according to Fierros and Conroy, once minority children such as African Americans and Latinos are labeled as students with special needs they are far less likely than caucasians to be placed in settings of inclusive learning and often receive less desirable treatment overall.<ref name=Losen />\n\nThis problem of [[racial segregation]] amongst minority students with special needs is an ongoing battle in need of resolution.  While historically there has been no ironclad solution to righting the wrongs of racial prejudices, there are ways in which we can all individually begin the process of equality within our educational institutions.  Organizations such as the US Department of Education provide resources that we as teachers, students, parents, and concerned individuals can utilize in order to better educate ourselves on the current issues and services regarding special needs education.  One such resource is the [[Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services|Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS)]] which provides links to currently debated topics, programs, initiatives, reports and resources as well support services.<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/index.html|website=US Department of Education}}</ref>\n\n== History of educational oppression ==\n\n===United States of America (US)===\n{{main|Educational inequality in the United States}}\nThe historical relationships in the United States between privileged and marginalized communities' play a major role in the administering of unequal and inadequate education to these socially excluded communities. The belief that certain communities in the United States were inferior in comparison to others has allowed these disadvantages to foster into the great magnitude of educational inequality that we see apparent today.\n\nFor African Americans, deliberate systematic education oppression dates back to enslavement, more specifically 1740. In 1740, North Carolina passed legislation that prohibited [[Education during the Slave Period|slave education]]. While the original legislature prohibited African Americans from being taught how to write, as other States adopted their own versions of the law, southern anti-literacy legislatures banned far more than just writing. Varying Southern laws prohibited African Americans from learning how to read, write, and assembling without the presence of slave owners. Many states as far as requiring free African Americans to leave in fear of them educating their enslaved brethren. By 1836, the public education of all African-Americans was strictly prohibited.\n\nThe enslavement of African Americans removed the access to education for generations.<ref name=\"Ladson-Billings\">{{cite journal|last=Ladson-Billings|first=Gloria|year=2006|title=From Achievement Gap to the Education Debt: Understanding Achievement in U.S. Schools|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=35|issue=7|series=AERA Presidential Address|pages=1\u201311|doi=10.3102/0013189x035007003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6066ab224addbc2fae64eea81391842c5b003827}}</ref>  Once the legal abolishment of slavery was enacted, racial stigma remained. Social, economic, and political barriers held blacks in a position of subordination.<ref name=\"Gamoran\" /> Although legally African Americans had the ability to be learning how to read and write, they were often prohibited from attending schools with White students. This form of segregation is often referred to as ''de jure'' segregation.<ref name=\":0\" /> The schools that allowed African American students to attend often lacked financial support, thus providing inadequate educational skills for their students. Freedmen's schools existed but they focused on maintaining African Americans in servitude, not enriching academic prosperity.<ref name=\"Ladson-Billings\" />  The United States then experienced legal separation in schools between whites and blacks. Schools were supposed to receive equal resources but there was an undoubted inequality. It was not until 1968 that Black students in the South had universal secondary education.<ref name=\"Ladson-Billings\" /> Research reveals that there was a shrinking of [[racial achievement gap in the United States|inequality between racial groups]] from 1970\u20131988, but since then the gap has grown again.<ref name=\"Williams\" /><ref name=\"Ladson-Billings\" />\n\nLatinos and American Indians experienced similar educational repression in the past, which effects are evident now. Latinos have been systematically shut out of educational opportunities at all levels. Evidence suggests that Latinos have experienced this educational repression in the United States as far back as 1848.<ref name=\"Ladson-Billings\" /> Despite the fact that it is illegal to not accept students based on their race, religion, or ethnicity, in the Southwest of the United States Latinos were often segregated through the deliberate practice of school and public officials.

Among these exclusive institutions, educational inequality is extreme, with only 6% and 3% of their students coming from the bottom two income quintiles.<ref>Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein, and Heidi Shierholz, The State of Working America 2008/ 2009 (Ithaca, NY: ILR Press)cited in Stiglitz, Joseph E.

In addition to the resources from family mentioned earlier, access to proper nutrition and health care influence the cognitive development of children.<ref name=Greenstone /> Children who come from poor families experience this inequality, which puts them at a disadvantage from the start. Not only important are resources students may or may not receive from family, but schools themselves vary greatly in the resources they give their students. On December 2, 2011, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] released that school districts are unevenly distributing funds, which are disproportionately underfunding low-income students.<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/12/educational_inequality.html|title=The Persistence of Educational Inequality|last=Brown|first=Cynthia G.|work=Center for American Progress|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref> This is holding back money from the schools that are in great need. High poverty schools have less-qualified teachers with a much higher turnover rate.<ref name=\"Lee and Orfield\" />  In every subject area, students in high poverty schools are more likely than other students to be taught by teachers without even a minor in their subject matter.<ref name=Haycock /> Better resources allows for the reduction of classroom size, which research has proven improves test scores.<ref name=Greenstone /> It also increases the number of after school and summer programs\u2014these are very beneficial to poor children because it not only combats the increased loss of skill over the summer but keeps them out of unsafe neighborhoods and combats the drop-out rate.<ref name=Greenstone />  There is also a difference in the classes offered to students, specifically advanced mathematics and science courses.  In 2012, Algebra II was offered to 82% of the schools (in diverse districts) serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students,  while only 65% of the schools serving the most African American and Hispanic students offered students the same course.  [[Physics]] was offered to 66% of the schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, compared to 40% serving the most.  [[Calculus]] was offered to 55% of the schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, compared to 29% serving the most.<ref name=CRDC />\n\nThis lack of resources is directly linked to ethnicity and race.

These tests include the [[Organization for Economic and Co-Operational Development]]'s Program of International Student Assessment and the [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement]]'s Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. To calculate the different test parameters in each country and calculate a standard score, the scores of these tests are put through [[Item Response Theory]] models. Once standardized, analysts can begin looking at education through the lens of achievement rather than looking at attainment. Through looking at achievement, the analysts can objectively examine educational inequality throughout the globe.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ferreira|first1=Francisco|last2=Jeremie|first2=Gignoux|title=Measurement of Educational Inequality: Achievement and Opportunity|journal=World Bank Economic Review|date=2014|volume=28|issue=2|pages=210\u2013246|doi=10.1093/wber/lht004|hdl=10986/23539}}</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\n{{hatnote|See selected issues under [[Higher education in the United States]].}}\n\n=== Social mobility ===\n''[[Social mobility]]'' refers to the movement in class status from one generation to another. It is related to the \"rags to riches\" notion that anyone, with hard work and determination, has the ability to move upward no matter what background they come from. Contrary to that notion, however, sociologists and economists have concluded that, although exceptions are heard of, social mobility has remained stagnant and even decreased over the past thirty years.<ref name=\"auto2\">Leonhardt, D. & Scott, J.

New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/national/class/OVERVIEW-FINAL.html</ref>   From 1979 through 2007 the wage income for lower and middle class citizens has risen by less than 17 percent while the one percent has grown by approximately 156 percent sharply contrasting the \"postwar period up through the 1970s, when income growth was broadly shared\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/subjects/overview/?reader|title=Overview {{!}} State of Working America|website=www.stateofworkingamerica.org|accessdate=2015-09-20}}</ref> Some of the decrease in social mobility may be explained by the stratified educational system. Research has shown that since 1973, men and women with at least a college degree have seen an increase in hourly wages, while the wages for those with less than a college degree have remained stagnant or have decreased during the same period of time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/subjects/wages/?reader|title=Wages {{!}} State of Working America|website=www.stateofworkingamerica.org|accessdate=2015-09-21}}</ref> Since the educational system forces low-income families to place their children into less-than-ideal school systems, those children are typically not presented with the same opportunities and educational motivation as are students from well-off families, resulting in patterns of repeated intergenerational educational choices for parent and child, also known as decreased or stagnant [[social mobility]].<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n== Remedies ==\nThere are a variety of efforts by countries to assist in increasing the availability of quality education for all children.\n\n===Assessment===\nBased on input from more than 1,700 individuals in 118 countries, [[UNESCO]] and the [[Center for Universal Education]] at the [[Brookings Institution]] have co-convened the Learning Metrics Task Force.<ref name=\"Brookings Assessments\" /> The task force aims to shift the focus from access to access plus learning.<ref name=\"Brookings Assessments\" /> They discovered through assessment, the learning and progress of students in individual countries can be measured.<ref name=\"Brookings Assessments\" /> Through the testing, governments can assess the quality of their education programs, refine the areas that need improvement, and ultimately increase their student's success.<ref name=\"Brookings Assessments\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2014/07/implementing-assessment-improve-learning|title=Toward Universal Learning: Implementing Assessment to Improve Learning|date=15 July 2014|website=Brookings Institution|publisher=Brookings Institution and UNESCO Institute for Statistics|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Education for All Act===\nThe [[Education For All]] act or EFA is a global commitment to provide quality basic education for all children, youth, and adults.

The entities working together to achieve these goals include governments, multilateral and development agencies, civil society and the private sector.

These classes are run through content sharing, videos, online forums and exams. The MOOCs are free which allow for many more students to take part in the classes, however the programs are created by global north countries, therefore inhibiting individuals in the global south from creating their own innovations.<ref name=\"Inequality South Africa\" />\n\n== Policy implications ==\n\nWith the knowledge that early educational intervention programs, such as extended childcare during preschool years, can significantly prepare low-income students for educational and life successes, comes a certain degree of responsibility. One policy change that seems necessary to make is that quality child care is available to every child in the United States at an affordable rate. This has been scientifically proven to push students into college, and thus increase [[social mobility]]. The ultimate end result of such a reality would be that the widely stratified educational system that exists in the U.S. today would begin to equalize so that every child born, regardless of [[socioeconomic status]], would have the same opportunity to succeed. Many European countries are already exercising such successful educational systems.\n\n== Global evidence ==\n\n[[File:School children in Rhbat, Nagar.jpg|thumb|right|alt=School children in Rhbat, Nagar sit in classroom learning.

The country inherited class, race and gender inequality in the social, political, and economic spheres during the [[Apartheid]]. The 1994 constitution emphasizes higher education as useful for human resource development and of great importance to any economic and social transitions. However, they are still fighting to overcome the [[colonialism]] and racism in intellectual spaces.<ref name=\"Inequality South Africa\" />\n\nFunding from the government has a major stake in the educational quality received. As a result of declining government support, the average class size in South Africa is growing. The increased class size limits student-teacher interactions, therefore further hindering students with low problem solving and critical thinking skills. In an article by Meenal Shrivastava and Sanjiv Shrivastava, the argument is made that in large class sizes \u201chave ramifications for developing countries where higher education where higher education is a core element in the economic and societal development\u201d.

These differences emerge early in childhood,<ref>Sullivan, A., Ketende, S., & Joshi, H. (2013). Social Class and Inequalities in Early Cognitive Scores. Sociology..</ref> and continue to grow throughout the school years.<ref>Feinstein, L. (2003). Inequality in the early cognitive development of British children in the 1970 cohort. Economica, 70(277), 73\u201397.</ref>\n\n=== Sudan Republic (SD) ===\n\nThe earliest educational system of Sudan was established by the British during the first half of the 20th century. The government of Sudan recognizes education as a right for every citizen and guarantees access to free basic education, The educational structure of the Republic of the Sudan consists of the pre-primary, primary, secondary and higher education, The Sudanese education system includes more than 3.646 schools run by public, private, and religious providers, the schools are overseen by the High Ministry of Education. However, Sudan's simmering wars and a lack of awareness about the importance of education and chronic under-development all contribute to the poor schooling of girls in Sudan. In addition, cultural pressures and the traditional views of the role of women mean fewer girls attend and remain in school. The inability to pay fees even though school is free according to government policy is a major reason, some poor families can't afford the stationaries & clothes, also the government can't provide all the students needs because of the economic situation and poverty. However government has raised their awareness of educating females, and they published universities only for girls, the first and the most popular one is AL Ahfad University for Women, located in Omdurman, created in 1907 by Sheikh Babikr Bedri. now percentage of educated females are increasing within time, based on the last survey estimates that 60.8% of females in Sudan can read & write.\n\n=== United States of America (US) ===\n''See selected issues and criticisms under [[Higher education in the United States]].''[[File:Children in a classroom.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Children in a classroom in the United States.|Children in a classroom in the United States]]\n\n====Property tax dilemma====\nIn the United States, schools are funded by local property taxes.  Because of this, the more affluent a neighborhood, the higher the funding for that school district. Although this situation seems favorable, the problem emerges when the equation is reversed. In neighborhoods inhabited by predominantly working and lower-class families, properties are less expensive, and so property taxes are much lower than those in affluent neighborhoods. Consequently, funding for the school districts to which working and lower class children are assigned is also significantly lower than the funding for the school districts to which children of affluent families are assigned. Thus, students in working and lower class schools do not receive the same quality of education and access to resources as do students from affluent families. The reality of the situation is that distribution of resources for schools is based on the socioeconomic status of the parents of the students. As a result, the U.S. educational system significantly aids in widening the gap between the rich and the poor. This gap has increased, rather than decreased, over the past few decades due in part to a lack of [[social mobility]].<ref name=\"auto\">Leonhardt, D. (2005). Class matters: The college dropout boom.

Some ways that Sweden is accomplishing these goals is by making sure every child can go to daycare affordably. Of the total cost of childcare, parents pay no more than 18% for their child; the remaining 82% is paid for by various government agencies and municipalities. In 2002, a \"maximum-fee\" system was introduced in Sweden that states that costs for childcare may be no greater than 3% of one's income for the first child, 2% for the second child, 1% for the third child, and free of charge for the fourth child in pre-school. 97.5% of children age 1\u20135 attend these public daycare centers. Also, a new law was recently introduced that states that all four- and five-year-old children can attend day care for free.<ref name=\"auto6\">Bjornberg, U. & Dahlgren, L. Policy: The case of Sweden. University of York, United Kingdom. http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/spru/research/nordic/swedenpoli.pdf</ref> Since practically all students, no matter what their socioeconomic background, attend the same daycare centers, equalization alongside educational development begins early and in the public sphere. Furthermore, parental leave consists of 12 months paid leave (80% of wage) whereas one month is awarded solely to the father in the form of \"use it or lose it\". This results in the privilege and affordability of staying home and bonding with one's child for the first year of life. Due to this affordability, less than 200 children in the entire country of Sweden under the age of 1 are placed in child care.<ref name=\"auto5\">Clawson, D. & Gerstel, N. (2007). Caring for our young: Childcare in Europe and the United States. Ed. Ferguson, S.J. Shifting the center: Understanding contemporary families. 3rd Ed. McGraw Hill: Boston, MA</ref>\n\nStratification in the educational system is further diminished by providing all Swedish citizens and legal residents with the option of choosing which school they want their children to be placed in, regardless of what neighborhood they reside in or what property taxes they pay. Additionally, the Swedish government not only provides its citizens with a free college education, but also with an actual monthly allowance for attending school and college.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\nTogether, these privileges allow for all Swedish children to have access to the same resources. A similar system can be found in France, where free, full-day child care centers known as \"\u00e9coles maternelles\" enroll close to 100% of French children ages 3\u20135 years old. In Denmark, children from birth to age six are enrolled in childcare programs that are available at one-fifth the total costs, where the rest is covered by public funding.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[British birth cohort studies]]\n* [[Class stratification]]\n* [[Conflict theory]]\n* [[Educational psychology]]\n* [[Hidden curriculum]]\n* [[List of standardized tests in the United States]]\n* [[Social inequality]]\n* [[Socioeconomic status]]\n* [[Structural inequality in education]]\n* [[Working class education]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://gpseducation.oecd.org/revieweducationpolicies/#!node=41746&filter=all OECD's Education GPS, a review of education policy analysis and statistics: Equity]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Educational Inequality}}\n[[Category:Education issues]]\n[[Category:Discrimination]]\n[[Category:Social inequality]]\n[[Category:Race and education]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLatino migration:Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_inequality"}
