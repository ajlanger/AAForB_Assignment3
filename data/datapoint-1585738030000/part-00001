Its harbour, one of the most strategically important in the western Mediterranean, was re-fortified.\n\nIn 1535, the Ottomans under [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] attacked Ma\u00f3-Mah\u00f3n and took 6,000 captives as slaves back to [[Algiers]], in the [[Sack of Mahon]].\n[[File:Port Mahon 1890.jpg|thumb|left|250px|1890 map of Ma\u00f3-Mah\u00f3n and surrounding region]]\n\n===British rule===\nMenorca was [[Capture of Menorca (1708)|captured in 1708]] by a joint British-Dutch force on behalf of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]], during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. The British saw the island's potential as a naval base and sought to take full control. Its status as a British possession was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. During the island's years as a [[British Empire|British dependency]], the capital was moved from [[Ciutadella de Menorca]] to Mahon, which then served as residence for the [[Governor of Menorca|governor]], the most famous being [[Richard Kane|General Richard Kane]]. During this period the natural harbour leading to the town and surrounding settlements were sometimes collectively known as ''\"Port Mahon\"'' ''(see map left)''.<ref>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTsgAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA251#v=onepage&q&f=false Minorca]\".

Edinburgh, Adam and Charles Black, 1858. p. 251.</ref>\n\nThe island was lost to the French in 1756 following the naval [[Battle of Menorca (1756)|Battle of Menorca]] and the final [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|Siege of Fort St Philip]], which took place several miles from the town. After their defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]], France returned the island to the British in 1763. In a joint Franco-Spanish effort and following a long [[Invasion of Menorca (1781)|five month invasion]], the British surrendered the island again in 1782; It was transferred to Spain in 1783 as part of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]]. The British [[Capture of Menorca (1798)|recaptured the island]] in 1798, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. The British and the French tried (and failed) to end hostilities between themselves with the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802. Both nations agreed to cede or withdraw from certain territories, with the island of Menorca passing to the Spanish, with whom it has remained since.\n\n====The Royal Navy====\nA small but important [[Royal Navy Dockyard]] was established by the British on the north side of the harbour, opposite the town, in 1715.<ref name=Coad2013>{{cite book|last1=Coad|first1=Jonathan|title=Support for the Fleet: architecture and engineering of the Royal Navy's bases, 1700-1914|date=2013|publisher=English Heritage|location=Swindon}}</ref> It served as the Royal Navy's principal Mediterranean base for much of the 18th century, and remains in use today as a [[Spanish Navy|Spanish Naval]] station. Several Dockyard buildings, dating from the 1760s, can still be seen on Illa Pinto (formerly known as Saffron Island) including a Naval Storehouse with clock tower.  There recently have been moves to establish a maritime museum here.<ref>{{cite web|title=Information booklet (bilingual Spanish/English)|url=http://retedigital.com/wp-content/themes/rete/pdfs/portus/Portus_23/la_estaci\u00f3n_naval_de_port.pdf}}</ref> The island has a distinctive octagonal shape, formed when wharves were constructed around it in the 1760s to enable several warships to be [[Careening|careened]] there all at once.\n\nThe ruins of a former [[Royal Naval Hospital]], founded in 1711, stand on another nearby island (Illa del Rei).

Its harbour, one of the most strategically important in the western Mediterranean, was re-fortified.\n\nIn 1535, the Ottomans under [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] attacked Ma\u00f3-Mah\u00f3n and took 6,000 captives as slaves back to [[Algiers]], in the [[Sack of Mahon]].\n[[File:Port Mahon 1890.jpg|thumb|left|250px|1890 map of Ma\u00f3-Mah\u00f3n and surrounding region]]\n\n===British rule===\nMenorca was [[Capture of Menorca (1708)|captured in 1708]] by a joint British-Dutch force on behalf of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]], during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. The British saw the island's potential as a naval base and sought to take full control. Its status as a British possession was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. During the island's years as a [[British Empire|British dependency]], the capital was moved from [[Ciutadella de Menorca]] to Mahon, which then served as residence for the [[Governor of Menorca|governor]], the most famous being [[Richard Kane|General Richard Kane]]. During this period the natural harbour leading to the town and surrounding settlements were sometimes collectively known as ''\"Port Mahon\"'' ''(see map left)''.<ref>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTsgAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA251#v=onepage&q&f=false Minorca]\".

After their defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]], France returned the island to the British in 1763. In a joint Franco-Spanish effort and following a long [[Invasion of Menorca (1781)|five month invasion]], the British surrendered the island again in 1782; It was transferred to Spain in 1783 as part of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]]. The British [[Capture of Menorca (1798)|recaptured the island]] in 1798, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. The British and the French tried (and failed) to end hostilities between themselves with the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802. Both nations agreed to cede or withdraw from certain territories, with the island of Menorca passing to the Spanish, with whom it has remained since.\n\n====The Royal Navy====\nA small but important [[Royal Navy Dockyard]] was established by the British on the north side of the harbour, opposite the town, in 1715.<ref name=Coad2013>{{cite book|last1=Coad|first1=Jonathan|title=Support for the Fleet: architecture and engineering of the Royal Navy's bases, 1700-1914|date=2013|publisher=English Heritage|location=Swindon}}</ref> It served as the Royal Navy's principal Mediterranean base for much of the 18th century, and remains in use today as a [[Spanish Navy|Spanish Naval]] station.
