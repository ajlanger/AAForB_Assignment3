After an honorable discharge, Gilbert taught himself to sew.

Before this pride, the [[Pink triangle]] was used as a symbol for the [[LGBT Movement]] but it represented a dark chapter in the history of same-sex rights. The [[Pink triangle]] was created by the Nazis during [[World War II]] to identify and stigmatize [[homosexuals]] in the same way the [[Star of David]] was used against [[Jews]] and others regarded as viruses or sub-humans in the social fabric. It functioned as a [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] tool of oppression. [[Harvey Milk]] and others didn't want to use this symbol anymore, Artie Bressan, a close friend of Baker's, pressed on Baker for a new symbol and called it \"the dawn of a new gay consciousness and freedom\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411163443/https://gilbertbaker.com/rainbow-flag-origin-story/|title=Rainbow Flag: Origin Story {{!}} Gillbert Baker|date=2019-04-11|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> It has been suggested that Baker may have been inspired by [[Judy Garland]]'s singing \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" and the [[Stonewall riots]] that happened a few days after Garland's death (she was one of the [[Judy Garland as gay icon|first gay icons]]).<ref>{{cite book |author = The National Museum & Archive of Lesbian and Gay History |author2 = Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center |year = 1996 |title = The Gay Almanac |location = New York |publisher = Berkeley Books |isbn = 978-0-425-15300-0 |oclc = 636576927 |page = [https://archive.org/details/gayalmanac00lesb/page/94 94] |url = https://archive.org/details/gayalmanac00lesb/page/94 }}</ref><ref name=\"Higgs1999\">{{cite book |last = Higgs |first = David |title = Queer Sites: Gay Urban Histories Since 1600 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BeKncyQyBEwC&pg=PA173 |access-date = November 19, 2012 |year = 1999 |publisher = Psychology Press |isbn = 978-0-415-15897-8 |pages = 173\u2013 |via = Google Books }}</ref> \n\nAnother suggestion for how the rainbow flag originated is that at college campuses during the 1960s, some people demonstrated for [[world peace]] by carrying a ''Flag of the Races'' (also called the ''Flag of the Human Race'') with five horizontal stripes (from top to bottom they were [[Color terminology for race|red, white, brown, yellow, and black]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/int-wpa.html |title=World Peace Association: Brotherhood flag |publisher=Crwflags.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-25}}</ref> \n\nThe first rainbow flags were commissioned by the fledgling pride committee and were produced by a team led by Baker that included artist Lynn Segerblom.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.losangelesblade.com/2018/03/02/woman-behind-rainbow-flag/ |title = The woman behind the Rainbow Flag |date = March 2, 2018 |work = Los Angeles Blade |access-date = March 8, 2018 |language = en-US }}</ref> Segerblom was then known as Faerie Argyle Rainbow; according to her, she created the original dyeing process for the flags.<ref>{{cite news|author=Hailey Branson-Potts |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-rainbow-flags-20180531-story.html |title=On the 40th anniversary of the LGBTQ pride symbol, artist wants her rainbow flag story told |newspaper=Latimes.com |date=2018-06-08 |accessdate=2018-06-25}}</ref> Baker is said to have gotten the idea for the [[rainbow flag]] from the ''Flag of the Races''<ref>{{cite web |url = http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/gsc/ally/lgbtsymbols/ |publisher = Carleton College |title = Symbols of Pride of the LGBTQ community |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080907001747/http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/gsc/ally/lgbtsymbols/ |archive-date = September 7, 2008 }} Noted as sourced to ''The Alyson Almanac'' from the college's library.</ref> in borrowing it from the [[Hippie movement]] of that time<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pXAsU1sQG1AC |title = San Francisco: The Unknown City |first1 = Helene |last1 = Goupil |first2 = Josh |last2 = Krist |publisher = Arsenal Pulp Press |year = 2005 |isbn = 978-1-55152-188-6 |page = 33 }}</ref> largely influenced by pioneering gay activist [[Allen Ginsberg]].

As Baker ramped up production of his version of the flag, he too dropped the hot pink stripe because of the unavailability of hot-pink fabric.

The organizers of the 1979 San Francisco parade decided to split the flag into two in order to decorate the two sides of the parade route.

The [[Pink triangle]] was created by the Nazis during [[World War II]] to identify and stigmatize [[homosexuals]] in the same way the [[Star of David]] was used against [[Jews]] and others regarded as viruses or sub-humans in the social fabric.
