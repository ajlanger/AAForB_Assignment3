It is set in rural western [[Pennsylvania]] during the autumn of 1943 and describes how the protagonist, Annabelle \"learned how to lie\" and \"that what I said and what I did mattered\" in relation to two interlopers in her life: the bully Betty Glengarry, and the mysterious drifter Toby. It was named a Newbery Honor book in 2016.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel is narrated by twelve-year-old Annabelle, who lives on a farm with her family and walks with her two younger brothers to school in the town of Wolf Hollow. A new girl, Betty Glengarry, started attending the same school earlier, in October 1943; she was sent to Wolf Hollow to live with her grandparents because, as rumor has it, she has been\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neemed 'incorrigible' by the city. One morning, Betty confronts Annabelle on their way to school, threatening to beat Annabelle or her younger brothers if Annabelle does not give her something nice; because Annabelle's house has a purple-colored glass window, Betty believes their family has money.\n\nSeveral years earlier, shortly after the start of the [[Great Depression]], a reclusive drifter named Toby had arrived in town, staying in an abandoned [[smokehouse]] living on berries and game. Little is known about him, except that he was a veteran of [[World War I]] and that he had borrowed Annabelle's family's camera on a semi-permanent basis.\n\nAnnabelle takes a penny from her [[piggy bank]] for Betty; the ensuing confrontation is witnessed by Toby, setting events into motion that result, in Annabelle's words, in her learning how to tell \"real lies fed by real fears\u2014things I said and did that took me out of the life I'd always known and put me down hard into a new one.\"\n\n==Development==\nWolk's family farm inspired the setting for ''Wolf Hollow''; her mother and two uncles lived on the farm and walked to school. In addition, Wolk stated she was inspired by contemporary events, as she \"hoped to create through Betty a microcosm of what was happening in the war. A ferocious bully and his sidekicks were murdering and terrorizing the world. Bringing out the worst in people, and sometimes the best. And Betty was doing the same on a much smaller scale in Wolf Hollow.\"<ref>{{cite interview |url=https://www.thechildrensbookreview.com/weblog/2016/10/lauren-wolk-discusses-wolf-hollow.html |title=Lauren Wolk Discusses Wolf Hollow |subject=Lauren Wolk |interviewer= |date=October 8, 2016 |work=The Children's Book Review |accessdate=17 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2017, the [[American Library Association]] named ''Wolf Hollow'' to its list of [[Newbery Medal|Newbery Honor winner]]s, alongside [[Ashley Bryan]]'s [[Freedom Over Me: Eleven Slaves, Their Lives and Dreams Brought to Life by Ashley Bryan|''Freedom Over Me'']] and [[Adam Gidwitz]]'s ''[[The Inquisitor's Tale]]''.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2017/01/american-library-association-announces-2017-youth-media-award-winners |title=American Library Association announces 2017 youth media award winners |date=January 30, 2017 |publisher=American Library Association |accessdate=16 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.laurenwolk.com/fiction.html |title=Fiction |author=Wolk, Lauren |website=laurenwolk.com |accessdate=17 March 2019}}\n\n[[Category:Young adult novels]]\n[[Category:Newbery Honor-winning works]]\n[[Category:2016 American novels]]\n[[Category:2016 children's books]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Pennsylvania]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox book\n| italic title      = <!--(see above)-->\n| name              = Wolf Hollow\n| image             = Wolf Hollow (Wolk, 2016).jpg\n| image_size        = \n| border            = \n| alt               = \n| caption           = \n| author            = [[Lauren Wolk]]\n| audio_read_by     = \n| title_orig        = \n| orig_lang_code    = \n| title_working     = \n| translator        = \n| illustrator       = \n| cover_artist      = {{ubl|Design: Irene Vandervoort |Lettering: Sarah J.
