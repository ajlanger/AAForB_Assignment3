The combined force numbered around 1,300 men: in comparison, the castle housed around 55 people, only 25 of whom were able fighters. Alongside Lady Arundell, who was aged 60, was her daughter-in-law ([[Cicely Compton, Lady Arundell of Wardour|Cicely]]) with her three young children, and around fifty servants, including the guards and soldiers.{{sfn|Lodge|1840|p=2}}\n\nThe castle was besieged for six days. Accounts from Royalists and Parliamentarians vary on the effectiveness of the siege: [[Bruno Ryves]], a Royalist propagandist, described that due to attacks which continued throughout day and night, the castle inhabitants were \"so distracted between hunger and want of rest, that when the hand endeavoured to administer food, surprised with sleep it forgot its employment, the morsels falling from their hands\".{{sfn|Wright|2004}} In contrast, the Parliamentarian officer [[Edmund Ludlow]] wrote that when he arrived on 8 May, little damage had been done to the house other than to one of the chimneys.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\nOn the day of Ludlow's arrival, the Parliamentarians blew up two or three barrels of gunpowder under one of the castle walls, where there was an opening \"for the conveying away of filth\", and destroyed part of the wall.{{sfn|Wright|2004}} Lady Arundell initially rejected the terms of surrender offered, which gave quarter to the women and children, but not the men. However, when the Parliamentarians threatened to mine the other wall, and to launch fireballs in through their broken windows, she relented.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}}\n\nAfter their capture of the castle, the Parliamentarians ransacked it, causing around \u00a3100,000 worth of damage.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}}{{efn|Approximately [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100000|1643|r=\u22126}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms.

The women had been allowed to keep six servants, but otherwise only had the clothes they were wearing.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}} From Shaftesbury they were transferred to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]]. Lady Arundell was released shortly thereafter. During her incarceration, her husband had been killed in the [[Battle of Stratton]], and she sought the protection of the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]], a Royalist commander. Lady Arundell's grandchildren were held until July 1644, when they were released in a prisoner exchange for the children of a Parliamentarian.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n==Second siege==\n[[File:Edmund Ludlow.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Edmund Ludlow]] held the castle for the Parliamentarians during the second siege.]]\nLudlow was appointed as the governor of Wardour Castle, and garrisoned the castle with 75 men,{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|pp=566\u2013567}} comprising his own cavalry troop and a company of infantry led by Captain Bean, from Hungerford's men.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=23}} The first challenge to the castle was posed by the [[James Ley, 3rd Earl of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]], who had men posted at [[Francis Cottington, 1st Baron Cottington|Lord Cottington]]'s house in nearby [[Fonthill Gifford]]. Hungerford's cavalry drove Marlborough's men from the area.{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} Ludlow prepared for a potential blockade by removing the siege works his army had built around the castle, and sinking a well within it.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=23}}\n\nIn a 1944 article in ''[[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine]]'', the historian H. F. Chettle suggests that [[Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour|Henry Arundell]], who upon his father's death had become the third Baron Arundell of Wardour, established a siege \"a fortnight after he [Ludlow] had settled in\", which would place the second siege as starting in late May.{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} In his memoirs, Ludlow said that Arundell arrived at the castle with some cavalry, and demanded that it surrender for the King. Ludlow refused, stating that he was holding it for Parliament, and \"could not surrender it without their command\".{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|pp=23\u201324}} Arundell did not have sufficient men to enforce a siege, so withdrew back to join the bulk of Hertford's Royalist forces.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=24}} Although there was no formal blockade of the castle, the country around it was controlled by the Royalists.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|pp=23\u201338}} \n\nLudlow recalls that two more approaches were made to the castle, one by a relation of Lord Cottington, and the other a friend of Ludlow's, [[Robert Phelips (Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster)|Robert Phelips]]. Both offered generous terms for the surrender of the castle to the Royalists, but in each case Ludlow refused, saying that he was \"resolved to run all hazards in the discharge of that trust which I had undertaken\".{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=25}} In order to stay well provisioned, the garrison ambushed farmers on their way to market in [[Shaftesbury]] and took their produce, recompensing them at market rates. The Royalists attempted to retake the castle by infiltrating the garrison with a young boy, reckoned by Ludlow to be \"not above twelve years of age\", into the castle. The boy had been tasked with poisoning the well and beer, sabotaging the weapons, counting the number of men in the garrison and then escaping. He was caught by the Parliamentarians and, after being threatened with execution, confessed.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=60}}\n\nTwo brothers, identified by the historian F. T. R. Edgar as Captain Henry Bowyer and Lieutenant Francis Bowyer, had command of two troops of [[dragoon]]s patrolling the area around the castle to defend against any sorties made by the garrison.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|p=146}} In late October 1643, [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Lord Hopton]] planned to recapture Wardour for the Royalists, but was forced to change his plans after the Royalist capture of [[Winchester]], and support the offensive in [[Hampshire]] and [[Sussex]] instead.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=58}} He was able to send reinforcements to the Bowyer brothers: [[Sir Charles Vavasour, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Vavasour]]'s infantry regiment and four artillery pieces.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|p=146}} Ludlow's memoirs recount an approach by Captain Christopher Bowyer, who he says commanded the Royalist forces around the castle.{{efn|It is unclear whether the Captain Christopher Bowyer listed by Ludlow is one of the Bowyer brothers listed by Edgar.}} Bowyer tightened the blockade of the garrison, and demanded again that it surrender, threatening that more troops and artillery were on their way. Ludlow refused, and another member of the Parliamentarian garrison, Captain Bean, shot Bowyer in the heel. Bowyer died of the infected wound a couple of days later.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=29}}\n\nBy mid to late November, Hopton met with Lord Arundell and Vavasour at Fonthill, where he learnt that Vavasour's regiment were mutinous. After hanging the ringleaders, Hopton requisitioned the regiment to join him in Winchester, and left a 300-strong infantry regiment led by Colonel George Barnes to maintain the siege.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|p=148}} Barnes tightened the siege, keeping soldiers \"within pistol-shot of it [the castle] night and day\".{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=31}} Provisions within the castle began to run out; the well was dry by each evening,{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=61}} and they began slaughtering their horses for food.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=30}} In December, Hopton sent Sir [[Francis Dodington]] with further reinforcements to aid in capturing the castle, including an engineer and some miners with him from the [[Mendip Hills]].{{sfn|French|2013|pp=116\u2013117}} Dodington was a wealthy land-owner from Somerset, who had according to the historian Michael J. French, had \"an unenviable reputation for ruthlessness and brutality\".{{sfn|French|2013|p=112}}\n\nThe mining team began work on tunnelling under the castle's walls: after three months they were prepared to blow the walls.{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}} Dodington offered the garrison another chance to surrender, which Ludlow once again rejected, and a few days later the first mine was exploded. Two versions of the event are offered: Ludlow relates that when one of his large artillery guns fired, it caused one of the matches left burning by the Royalists to fall into the powder of the mine and detonate it.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=34}} In Lise Hull's 2006 book, ''Britain's Medieval Castles'', she says that one of the Parliamentarian garrison \"unwittingly tossed a match into the tunnel where a mine lay hidden\".{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=50}} The resulting explosion destroyed the west wall of the castle,{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} which according to Ludlow included the wall of his own room, from which he had to escape by dropping down onto a ladder {{convert|2|yards|spell=in}} below.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|pp=34\u201335}} Despite preventing the Royalists  from storming the castle, Ludlow negotiated a surrender with Arundell and Dodington a few days later. They provided generous terms: quarter without distinction and civil usage for all, a speedy exchange, and not to be transported to [[Oxford]].{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Scars of Many an Age (10104333193).jpg|thumb|right|Wardour Castle was slighted after the Civil War]]\nDespite the terms agreed, two of the soldiers taken prisoner from the garrison were arrested and executed as Royalist deserters, and Ludlow was taken to Oxford, where he was imprisoned.{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}} He was quickly exchanged, and by July 1644 he had returned to Wiltshire as [[High Sheriff of Wiltshire|High Sheriff]], and a colonel under Sir [[William Waller]].{{sfn|Firth|Worden|2006}}\n\nLord Arundell had reclaimed his family home but it was no longer habitable,{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=50}} and he subsequently had it [[slighted]] to prevent further use as a garrison, moving the family home to [[Breamore]] in Hampshire.{{sfn|Sherlock|2009}} A mansion was built near Wardour Castle, dubbed [[New Wardour Castle]], between 1770 and 1776 by [[Henry Arundell, 8th Baron Arundell of Wardour]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1000507 |desc=Wardour Castle and Old Wardour Castle |accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof00aubruoft |title=The natural history of Wiltshire |last=Aubrey |first=John |authorlink=John Aubrey |year=1847 |publisher=Wiltshire Topographical Society |location=London |oclc=697583041 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Chettle |first=H.

However, when the Parliamentarians threatened to mine the other wall, and to launch fireballs in through their broken windows, she relented.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}}\n\nAfter their capture of the castle, the Parliamentarians ransacked it, causing around \u00a3100,000 worth of damage.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}}{{efn|Approximately [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100000|1643|r=\u22126}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms.

The women had been allowed to keep six servants, but otherwise only had the clothes they were wearing.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=46}} From Shaftesbury they were transferred to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]]. Lady Arundell was released shortly thereafter. During her incarceration, her husband had been killed in the [[Battle of Stratton]], and she sought the protection of the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]], a Royalist commander. Lady Arundell's grandchildren were held until July 1644, when they were released in a prisoner exchange for the children of a Parliamentarian.{{sfn|Wright|2004}}\n\n==Second siege==\n[[File:Edmund Ludlow.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Edmund Ludlow]] held the castle for the Parliamentarians during the second siege.]]\nLudlow was appointed as the governor of Wardour Castle, and garrisoned the castle with 75 men;{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|pp=566\u2013567}} comprising his own cavalry troop, and a company of infantry led by Captain Bean, from Hungerford's men.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=23}} The first challenge to the castle was posed by the [[James Ley, 3rd Earl of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]], who had men posted at [[Francis Cottington, 1st Baron Cottington|Lord Cottington]]'s house in nearby [[Fonthill Gifford]]. Hungerford's cavalry drove Marlborough's men from the area.{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} Ludlow prepared for a potential blockade by removing the siege works his army had built around the castle, and sinking a well within it.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=23}}\n\nIn a 1944 article in ''[[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine]]'', the historian H. F. Chettle suggests that [[Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour|Henry Arundell]], who upon his father's death had become the third Baron Arundell of Wardour, established a siege \"a fortnight after he [Ludlow] had settled in\", which would place the second siege as starting in late May.{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} In his memoirs, Ludlow said that Arundell arrived at the castle with some cavalry, and demanded that it surrender for the King; Ludlow refused, stating that he was holding it for Parliament, and \"could not surrender it without their command\".{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|pp=23\u201324}} Arundell did not have sufficient men to enforce a siege, so withdrew back to join the bulk of Hertford's Royalist forces.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=24}} Although there was no formal blockade of the castle, the country around it was controlled by the Royalists.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|pp=23\u201338}} \n\nLudlow recalls that two more approaches were made to the castle, one by a relation of Lord Cottington, and the other a friend of Ludlow's, [[Robert Phelips (Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster)|Robert Phelips]]. Both offered generous terms for the surrender of the castle to the Royalists, but in each case Ludlow refused, saying that he was \"resolved to run all hazards in the discharge of that trust which I had undertaken.\"{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=25}} In order to stay well provisioned, the garrison ambushed farmers on their way to market in [[Shaftesbury]] and took their produce, recompensing them at market rates. The Royalists attempted to retake the castle by infiltrating the garrison with a young boy, reckoned by Ludlow to be \"not above twelve years of age\" in the castle. The boy had been tasked with poisoning the well and beer, sabotaging the weapons, counting the number of men in the garrison and then escaping. He was caught by the Parliamentarians and, after being threatened with execution, confessed.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=60}}\n\nTwo brothers, identified by the historian F. T. R. Edgar as Captain Henry Bowyer and Lieutenant Francis Bowyer, had command of two troops of [[dragoon]]s patrolling the area around the castle to defend against any sorties made by the garrison.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|p=146}} In late October 1643, [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Lord Hopton]] planned to recapture Wardour for the Royalists, but was forced to change his plans after the Royalist capture of [[Winchester]], and support the offensive in [[Hampshire]] and [[Sussex]] instead.{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=58}} He was able to send reinforcements to the Bowyer brothers; [[Sir Charles Vavasour, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Vavasour]]'s infantry regiment and four artillery pieces.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|p=146}} Ludlow's memoirs recount an approach by Captain Christopher Bowyer, who he says commanded the Royalist forces around the castle.{{efn|It is unclear whether the Captain Christopher Bowyer listed by Ludlow is one of the Bowyer brothers listed by Edgar.}} Bowyer tightened the blockade of the garrison, and demanded again that it surrender, threatening that more troops and artillery were on their way. Ludlow refused, and another member of the Parliamentarian garrison, Captain Bean, shot Bowyer in the heel: Bowyer died of the infected wound a couple of days later.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=29}}\n\nBy mid to late November, Hopton met with Lord Arundell and Vavasour at Fonthill where he learnt that Vavasour's regiment were mutinous. After hanging the ringleaders, Hopton requisitioned the regiment to join him in Winchester, and left a 300-strong infantry regiment led by Colonel George Barnes to maintain the siege.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|p=148}} Barnes tightened the siege, keeping soldiers \"within pistol-shot of it [the castle] night and day\".{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=31}} Provisions within the castle began to run out; the well was dry by each evening,{{sfn|Goodwin|1996|p=61}} and they began slaughtering their horses for food.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=30}} In December, Hopton sent Sir [[Francis Dodington]] with further reinforcements to aid in capturing the castle, including an engineer and some miners with him from the [[Mendip Hills]].{{sfn|French|2013|pp=116\u2013117}} Dodington was a wealthy land-owner from Somerset, who had according to the historian Michael J. French, had \"an unenviable reputation for ruthlessness and brutality.\"{{sfn|French|2013|p=112}}\n\nThe mining team began work on tunnelling under the castle's walls; after three months they were prepared to blow the walls.{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}} Dodington offered the garrison another chance to surrender, which Ludlow once again rejected, and a few days later the first mine was exploded. Two versions of the event are offered: Ludlow relates that when one of his large artillery guns fired, it caused one of the matches left burning by the Royalists to fall into the powder of the mine and detonate it.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|p=34}} In Lise Hull's 2006 book, ''Britain's Medieval Castles'', she says that one of the Parliamentarian garrison \"unwittingly tossed a match into the tunnel where a mine lay hidden.\"{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=50}} The resulting explosion destroyed the west wall of the castle,{{sfn|Chettle|1944|p=455}} which according to Ludlow included the wall of his own room, from which he had to escape by dropping down onto a ladder {{convert|2|yards|spell=in}} below.{{sfn|Ludlow|1751|pp=34\u201335}} Despite preventing the Royalists  from storming the castle, Ludlow negotiated a surrender with Arundell and Dodington a few days later. They provided generous terms; quarter without distinction and civil usage for all, a speedy exchange, and not to be transported to [[Oxford]].{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Scars of Many an Age (10104333193).jpg|thumb|right|Wardour Castle was slighted after the Civil War]]\nDespite the terms agreed, two of the soldiers taken prisoner from the garrison were arrested and executed as Royalist deserters, and Ludlow was taken to Oxford where he was imprisoned.{{sfn|French|2013|p=117}} He was quickly exchanged, and by July 1644 he had returned to Wiltshire as [[High Sheriff of Wiltshire|High Sheriff]], and a colonel under Sir [[William Waller]].{{sfn|Firth|Worden|2006}}\n\nLord Arundell had reclaimed his family home, but it was no longer habitable,{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=50}} and he subsequently had it [[slighted]] to prevent further use as a garrison, moving the family home to [[Breamore]] in Hampshire.{{sfn|Sherlock|2009}} A mansion was built near Wardour Castle, dubbed [[New Wardour Castle]], between 1770 and 1776 by [[Henry Arundell, 8th Baron Arundell of Wardour]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1000507 |desc=Wardour Castle and Old Wardour Castle |accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof00aubruoft |title=The natural history of Wiltshire |last=Aubrey |first=John |authorlink=John Aubrey |year=1847 |publisher=Wiltshire Topographical Society |location=London |oclc=697583041 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Chettle |first=H.
