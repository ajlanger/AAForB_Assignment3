The engines of the lighter group were retired by 1936.\n\nAll those engines left in [[Germany]] after the [[Second World War]] went into the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR)|Deutsche Reichsbahn]] in [[East Germany]]. The DR also received two former ''\u00c9tat'' engines from France and grouped them as numbers 94 2151 and 94 2152. The last ones were in service until the second half of the 1970s.\n\nThe non-working locomotive, 94&nbsp;2110, ended up after the war in [[Austria]] after passing through [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]]. It was incorporated into the fleet of the [[Austrian Federal Railway]] as '''\u00d6BB&nbsp;794.2110''', but was retired in 1953 without having been used.\n\nOf the locomotives remaining in Czechoslovakia after the war, several continued to be used for a time. Locomotive 94 2021 was even given the [[\u010cSD]] number 516.0500 and was not retired until 1952.\n\nThe last area of operations for these locomotives in the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] was on the ramp from [[Eibenstock]] upper station to Eibenstock lower station which was closed in autumn 1975.\n\nThe last preserved locomotive of this class - number 94 2105 - may be found today in the railway museum at [[Schwarzenberg/Erzgeb.]].\n\n==Technical features==\nThe engines of the second batch had a lower weight, due to their shorter [[boiler]] and a reduction in the coal and water capacity, in order to be able to run on branch lines with light trackway.\n\nFrom running number 2094 (1921 series) onwards the locomotives had factory-fitted [[compressed-air brakes]], from running number 2112 (1923 series) the engines were equipped with ''Knorr'' [[feedwater heater]]s on the crown of the boiler barrel behind the chimney. Those engines delivered prior to that were all retrofitted with compressed-air brakes and, in most cases, also with surface economisers. The 1908/09 series only rarely had preheaters.
