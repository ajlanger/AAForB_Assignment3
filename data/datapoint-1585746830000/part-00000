During the following year, 1977, several thousand dissenting [[clergy]] and laypersons responded to those actions by meeting in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] under the auspices of the Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicanchurches.net/jurisdictions.html|title=Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen - Directory of Jurisdictions|accessdate=5 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131140728/http://www.anglicanchurches.net/jurisdictions.html|archive-date=31 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and adopted a theological statement, the [[Affirmation of St. Louis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acahome.org/submenu/docs/affirm.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716133729/http://www.acahome.org/submenu/docs/affirm.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Affirmation of St. Louis (1977)|archivedate=July 16, 2006|website=www.acahome.org}}</ref> The Affirmation expressed a determination \"to continue in the Catholic Faith, Apostolic Order, Orthodox Worship and Evangelical Witness of the traditional Anglican Church, doing all things necessary for the continuance of the same.\"\n\nOut of this meeting came a new church with the provisional name of the \"Anglican Church in North America (Episcopal)\".  The first bishop of the new church, [[Charles Doren]], was consecrated by a retired bishop of the Episcopal Church, [[Albert A. Chambers]] of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Springfield|Diocese of Springfield, Illinois]], with Francisco Pagtakhan of the [[Philippine Independent Church]] as co-consecrator. Although expected to be the third bishop participating in Doren's consecration, [[Mark Pae]] of the Anglican Church of Korea sent a letter of consent instead. This development left the new group open to charges of violating the customs of [[apostolic succession]], in which three bishops customarily are present.\n\nThe newly consecrated Doren then joined with Chambers and Pagtakhan in consecrating as bishops [[James Orin Mote]], [[Robert S. Morse]], and Francis Watterson. Watterson left the movement shortly afterward and became a [[Roman Catholic]] priest.\n\n===Early fractures===\nDuring the process of ratifying the new church's constitution, disputes developed which split its dioceses into two American churches and a separate Canadian church. These were the [[Anglican Catholic Church]] led by Mote, the Diocese of Christ the King (now the [[Anglican Province of Christ the King]]) led by Morse, and the [[Anglican Catholic Church of Canada]]. In 1981, Doren and others left the Anglican Catholic Church to found the [[United Episcopal Church of North America]] in opposition to the alleged inhospitality of the other jurisdictions towards [[low church]]men.\n\n===Recent developments and statistics===\nThe original generation of Continuing Anglican parishes in North America were located mainly in metropolitan areas. Since the late 1990s, a number have appeared in smaller communities, often as a result of a division in the town's existing Episcopal parish(es) or mission(s). The 2007/08 ''Directory of Traditional Anglican and Episcopal Parishes'', published by The Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicanchurches.net/|title=Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> contained information on over 900 parishes affiliated with either the Continuing Anglican churches or the [[Anglican realignment]] movement.\n\nThe principles of the [[Affirmation of St. Louis]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of Religion, provide some basis for unity in the movement, but the jurisdictions are numerous, usually quite small in membership and often splinter and recombine.  Many church bodies of more recent origin have referred to themselves as \"Continuing Anglican\" although they have no connection to the Congress of St. Louis and do not adhere to all of its principles. Some reports put the number of such jurisdictions at more than forty, but fewer than a dozen of the churches popularly called \"Continuing Anglican churches\" can be traced back to the meeting in St. Louis.\n\n====Reunification efforts====\n[[File:Consecrations 2009 2.JPG|thumb|right|375px|Processional of clergy from three Continuing Anglican churches, the [[Anglican Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Province of Christ the King]] and the [[United Episcopal Church of North America]].]]\n\nIn 2007, various jurisdictions made attempts at overcoming the movement's divisions. The [[Anglican Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Province of Christ the King]], and the [[United Episcopal Church of North America]] entered into discussions about possible organic unity. A Communion Agreement was entered into on May 17, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancatholic.org/acc-uec.html|title=Anglican Catholic|author=Plexus Web Creations|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>  In January 2009 one bishop from each jurisdiction consecrated three [[suffragan bishop]]s in St. Louis, intending that they serve all three jurisdictions.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe [[Anglican Episcopal Church]] and the [[Diocese of the Great Lakes]] formed the [[North American Anglican Conference]] for mutual assistance between \"Biblical Anglican\" churches. A suffragan bishop was consecrated for the Anglican Episcopal Church in late 2008 by its presiding bishop and three bishops of the Diocese of the Great Lakes. Both the Diocese of the Great Lakes, and the Anglican Episcopal Church have subsequently merged with the United Episcopal Church of North America.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nAnother regional association facilitating increased dialogue and fellowship opportunities is Common Cause Appalachia,\nto which some continuing Anglican churches in Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Tennessee belong.<ref>[http://anglican-cca.org/l]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, one Continuing Anglican church body, the [[Traditional Anglican Communion]] (TAC), made a formal proposal to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for admission into [[full communion|\"full corporate and sacramental union\"]] with that church in a manner that would permit the retention of some of its Anglican heritage.<ref>Hepworth, John.

Watterson left the movement shortly afterward and became a [[Roman Catholic]] priest.\n\n===Early fractures===\nDuring the process of ratifying the new church's constitution, disputes developed which split its dioceses into two American churches and a separate Canadian church. These were the [[Anglican Catholic Church]] led by Mote, the Diocese of Christ the King (now the [[Anglican Province of Christ the King]]) led by Morse, and the [[Anglican Catholic Church of Canada]]. In 1981, Doren and others left the Anglican Catholic Church to found the [[United Episcopal Church of North America]] in opposition to the alleged inhospitality of the other jurisdictions towards [[low church]]men.\n\n===Recent developments and statistics===\nThe original generation of Continuing Anglican parishes in North America were located mainly in metropolitan areas. Since the late 1990s, a number have appeared in smaller communities, often as a result of a division in the town's existing Episcopal parish(es) or mission(s). The 2007/08 ''Directory of Traditional Anglican and Episcopal Parishes'', published by The Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicanchurches.net/|title=Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> contained information on over 900 parishes affiliated with either the Continuing Anglican churches or the [[Anglican realignment]] movement.\n\nThe principles of the [[Affirmation of St. Louis]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of Religion, provide some basis for unity in the movement, but the jurisdictions are numerous, usually quite small in membership and often splinter and recombine.  Many church bodies of more recent origin have referred to themselves as \"Continuing Anglican\" although they have no connection to the Congress of St. Louis and do not adhere to all of its principles. Some reports put the number of such jurisdictions at more than forty, but fewer than a dozen of the churches popularly called \"Continuing Anglican churches\" can be traced back to the meeting in St. Louis.\n\n====Reunification efforts====\n[[File:Consecrations 2009 2.JPG|thumb|right|375px|Processional of clergy from three Continuing Anglican churches, the [[Anglican Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Province of Christ the King]] and the [[United Episcopal Church of North America]].]]\n\nIn 2007, various jurisdictions made attempts at overcoming the movement's divisions. The [[Anglican Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Province of Christ the King]], and the [[United Episcopal Church of North America]] entered into discussions about possible organic unity. A Communion Agreement was entered into on May 17, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancatholic.org/acc-uec.html|title=Anglican Catholic|author=Plexus Web Creations|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>  In January 2009 one bishop from each jurisdiction consecrated three [[suffragan bishop]]s in St. Louis, intending that they serve all three jurisdictions.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe [[Anglican Episcopal Church]] and the [[Diocese of the Great Lakes]] formed the [[North American Anglican Conference]] for mutual assistance between \"Biblical Anglican\" churches. A suffragan bishop was consecrated for the Anglican Episcopal Church in late 2008 by its presiding bishop and three bishops of the Diocese of the Great Lakes. Both the Diocese of the Great Lakes, and the Anglican Episcopal Church have subsequently merged with the United Episcopal Church of North America.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nAnother regional association facilitating increased dialogue and fellowship opportunities is Common Cause Appalachia,\nto which some continuing Anglican churches in Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Tennessee belong.<ref>[http://anglican-cca.org/l]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, one Continuing Anglican church body, the [[Traditional Anglican Communion]] (TAC), made a formal proposal to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for admission into [[full communion|\"full corporate and sacramental union\"]] with that church in a manner that would permit the retention of some of its Anglican heritage.<ref>Hepworth, John.
