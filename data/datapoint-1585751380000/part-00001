His films include ''[[I Shot Jesse James]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]'' (1958).\n\nIn 1962 Lippert said, \"the word around Hollywood is: Lippert makes a lot of cheap pictures but he's never made a stinker\".<ref name=\"rob\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Alameda, California]] and adopted by the owner of a hardware store Robert Lippert became fascinated by the cinema at an early age. As a youngster, he worked a variety of jobs in local theaters, including projectionist and assistant manager. As a manager of a cinema during the [[Great Depression|Depression]], Lippert encouraged regular attendance with promotions such as \"Dish Night\" and \"Book Night\".\n\nLippert went from cinema manager to owning a chain of cinemas in California in 1942, during the peak years of theater attendance.<ref>[http://mst3k.booyaka.com/episodes/directors/robert_lippert.txt Booyaka.com]</ref> Lippert's theaters in Los Angeles often screened older films for a continuous 24 hours with an admission price of 25 cents. Not only did his theaters attract shift workers and late-night revelers, but servicemen on leave who could not find cheap accommodation and would sleep in the chairs.<ref>p. 110 ''Maury Dexter Interview'' by Tom Weaver '' I Talked with a Zombie: Interviews with 23 Veterans of Horror and Sci-Fi'' McFarland</ref>\n\nIn May 1948 he merged his theater chain with George Mann's.<ref>Mustering-out pay dead line changed.

A 1949 ''New York Times'' profile said he owned 61 theaters. It also reported (erroneously) that he had directed most of the Westerns his company had made.<ref name=\"lip1\">By, A. H. W. (1949, Jan 30). BY WAY OF REPORT. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/105774114</ref>\n\nLippert tried to add luster to his productions, but only if it could be done economically. His studio became a haven for actors whose careers were interrupted when their studios, no longer making lower-budget pictures, released them from their contracts. Robert Lippert was able to sign major-studio talent for a fraction of the usual rate, giving his productions more marquee value. Among the established names who worked for Lippert were George Raft, [[Veronica Lake]], [[Zachary Scott]], [[Robert Hutton]], [[Joan Leslie]], [[George Reeves]], [[Ralph Byrd]], [[Richard Arlen]], [[Don \"Red\" Barry]], [[Robert Alda]], [[Gloria Jean]], [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]], [[Ellen Drew]], [[Preston Foster]], [[Jean Porter]], [[Anne Gwynne]], [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], [[Tom Neal]], [[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]], and [[John Howard]].\n\nAdditional selling angles were realized when certain of Lippert's features could be marketed in a process more elaborate than ordinary black-and-white. Lippert used [[Cinecolor]] and [[sepiatone]] to dress up his more ambitious features, and embellished others by using tinted film stock for special effects (mint green for ''[[Lost Continent (1951 film)|Lost Continent]]'', pinkish-red for the Mars sequences in ''[[Rocketship X-M]]''). He even anticipated the [[3D film|3-D]] film craze by publicizing a special photographic lens, which he claimed gave a stereoscopic effect without special projection equipment.\n\nIn addition to his original productions, Lippert reissued older films to theaters under his own brand name, including several [[Hopalong Cassidy]] westerns and the [[Laurel and Hardy]] feature ''[[Babes in Toyland (1934 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (reissued as ''March of the Wooden Soldiers'').\n\nLippert read a 1949 ''[[Life Magazine|Life]]'' magazine article about a proposed trip to and landing on the [[Moon]]. He rushed into production his film version called ''Rocketship X-M'', released a year later in 1950; he changed the destination to [[Mars]] to avoid copying exactly the same idea being utilized by producer [[George Pal]] in his large-budget, high-profile ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]''. ''Rocketship X-M'' succeeded in becoming the first [[post-war]] science fiction [[outer space]] drama to appear in theaters, but just barely. More importantly, it became the first film drama to warn of the dangers and folly of full-scale atomic war.\n\n[[Ron Ormond]] produced and directed several films for Lippert, including many westerns with [[Lash LaRue]].\n\nIn 1951 Lippert signed the first contract with the American Federation of Musicians to sell films to television. Lippert had to rescore some of the films and pay an amount to the musicians' music fund.<ref>First contract signed to allow sale of movies to television. (1951, Apr 25).

To ensure familiarity with American audiences, Lippert insisted on an American star supplied by him in the Hammer films he was to distribute. The first film produced under the contract was ''[[The Last Page]]'',<ref name=\"Lyons\">{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Arthur |title=Death on the Cheap: The Lost B Movies of Film Noir!|year=2000|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-80996-5|page=115}}</ref> which starred [[George Brent]].\n\n===Sam Fuller===\nScreenwriter and former newspaper reporter [[Samuel Fuller]] wanted to become a director, so he agreed to direct the three films he had been contracted to write for Lippert: ''[[I Shot Jesse James]]'', ''[[The Baron of Arizona]]'' and ''[[The Steel Helmet]]'', all for no extra money and just the directing credit.<ref>Fuller, Samuel ''A Third Face'' Alfred A Knopf (2002)</ref>\n\n===Sid Melton===\n\nLippert's most ubiquitous actor was probably the diminutive [[Sid Melton]]. He appeared as a supporting comedian in many of Lippert's productions and starred in three one hour-long comedies.\n\n==20th Century-Fox==\n===Regal Pictures===\nWhen [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] announced his [[CinemaScope]] process, he faced hostility from many theatre owners who had gone to great expense to convert their theatres to show [[3-D film]]s that Hollywood had stopped making. Zanuck assured them that they could have a large supply of CinemaScope product because Fox would make CinemaScope lenses available to other film companies and start a production unit, led by Lippert, called '''Regal Pictures''' in 1956 to produce [[B picture]]s in that process.\n\nLippert's company was contracted to make 20 pictures a year for seven years, each to be shot in seven days for no more than $100,000. Due to Lippert's problems with the film unions over not paying residuals to actors and writers of his films when they were sold to television, Ed Baumgarten was officially appointed the head of Regal, but Lippert had overall control.<ref>p.94 ''Maury Dexter Interview'' by Tom Weaver '' I Talked with a Zombie: Interviews with 23 Veterans of Horror and Sci-Fi'' McFarland</ref><ref>Dexter p 89</ref> Regal Pictures filmed its movies with CinemaScope lenses, but due to 20th Century-Fox insisting that only its \"A\" films would be labelled CinemaScope, Regal's product used the term \"Regalscope\" in its films' credits.<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/cslist.htm Widescreenmuseum.com]</ref>\n\nBeginning with ''[[Stagecoach to Fury]]'' (1956), Regal produced 25 pictures in its first year.<ref>By, T.

The films were entirely financed and released by Fox, but Regal was independent. Dexter says \"the only stipulation production-wise was that we had to give Bausch and Lomb screen credit on each film for CinemaScope camera lenses, as well as being charged back to Fox, $3,000 of each budget.<ref>Dexter p 88</ref>\n\nImpressed by the unit's profits, Fox extended Regal's contract by a further 16 films with an \"exploitation angle\" that would be approved by Fox.<ref>p.103 Dombrowski, Lisa ''The Films of Samuel Fuller: If You Die, I'll Kill You!''

It did not make a deal with writers, and the Screenwriters Guild forbade its writers to work for Lippert. Regal stopped making films.\n\nIn 1960 Lippert sold 30 Regal films to television for $1 million.<ref>National telefilm concern buys 30 films from regal. (1960, Jan 21).

The company was headed by George Warren, a cost controller for MGM, with William Magginetti as production supervisor and Harry Spaulding as story editor.

His films include ''[[I Shot Jesse James]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]'' (1958).\n\nIn 1962 Lippert said, \"the word around Hollywood is: Lippert makes a lot of cheap pictures but he's never made a stinker\".<ref name=\"rob\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Alameda, California]] and adopted by the owner of a hardware store Robert Lippert became fascinated by the cinema at an early age. As a youngster, he worked a variety of jobs in local theaters, including projectionist and assistant manager. As a manager of a cinema during the [[Great Depression|Depression]], Lippert encouraged regular attendance with promotions such as \"Dish Night\" and \"Book Night\".\n\nLippert went from cinema manager to owning a chain of cinemas in California in 1942, during the peak years of theater attendance.<ref>[http://mst3k.booyaka.com/episodes/directors/robert_lippert.txt Booyaka.com]</ref> Lippert's theaters in Los Angeles often screened older films for a continuous 24 hours with an admission price of 25 cents. Not only did his theaters attract shift workers and late-night revelers, but servicemen on leave who could not find cheap accommodation and would sleep in the chairs.<ref>p. 110 ''Maury Dexter Interview'' by Tom Weaver '' I Talked with a Zombie: Interviews with 23 Veterans of Horror and Sci-Fi'' McFarland</ref>\n\nIn May 1948 he merged his theater chain with George Mann's.<ref>Mustering-out pay dead line changed.

A 1949 ''New York Times'' profile said he owned 61 theaters. It also reported (erroneously) that he had directed most of the Westerns his company had made.<ref name=\"lip\">By, A. H. W. (1949, Jan 30). BY WAY OF REPORT. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/105774114</ref>\n\nLippert tried to add luster to his productions, but only if it could be done economically. His studio became a haven for actors whose careers were interrupted when their studios, no longer making lower-budget pictures, released them from their contracts. Robert Lippert was able to sign major-studio talent for a fraction of the usual rate, giving his productions more marquee value. Among the established names who worked for Lippert were George Raft, [[Veronica Lake]], [[Zachary Scott]], [[Robert Hutton]], [[Joan Leslie]], [[George Reeves]], [[Ralph Byrd]], [[Richard Arlen]], [[Don \"Red\" Barry]], [[Robert Alda]], [[Gloria Jean]], [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]], [[Ellen Drew]], [[Preston Foster]], [[Jean Porter]], [[Anne Gwynne]], [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], [[Tom Neal]], [[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]], and [[John Howard]].\n\nAdditional selling angles were realized when certain of Lippert's features could be marketed in a process more elaborate than ordinary black-and-white. Lippert used [[Cinecolor]] and [[sepiatone]] to dress up his more ambitious features, and embellished others by using tinted film stock for special effects (mint green for ''[[Lost Continent (1951 film)|Lost Continent]]'', pinkish-red for the Mars sequences in ''[[Rocketship X-M]]''). He even anticipated the [[3D film|3-D]] film craze by publicizing a special photographic lens, which he claimed gave a stereoscopic effect without special projection equipment.\n\nIn addition to his original productions, Lippert reissued older films to theaters under his own brand name, including several [[Hopalong Cassidy]] westerns and the [[Laurel and Hardy]] feature ''[[Babes in Toyland (1934 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (reissued as ''March of the Wooden Soldiers'').\n\nLippert read a 1949 ''[[Life Magazine|Life]]'' magazine article about a proposed trip to and landing on the [[Moon]]. He rushed into production his film version called ''Rocketship X-M'', released a year later in 1950; he changed the destination to [[Mars]] to avoid copying exactly the same idea being utilized by producer [[George Pal]] in his large-budget, high-profile ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]''. ''Rocketship X-M'' succeeded in becoming the first [[post-war]] science fiction [[outer space]] drama to appear in theaters, but just barely. More importantly, it became the first film drama to warn of the dangers and folly of full-scale atomic war.\n\n[[Ron Ormond]] produced and directed several films for Lippert, including many westerns with [[Lash LaRue]].\n\nIn 1951 Lippert signed the first contract with the American Federation of Musicians to sell films to television. Lippert had to rescore some of the films and pay an amount to the musicians' music fund.<ref>First contract signed to allow sale of movies to television. (1951, Apr 25).

He appeared as a supporting comedian in many of Lippert's productions and starred in three one hour-long comedies.\n\n==20th Century-Fox==\n===Regal Pictures===\nWhen [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] announced his [[CinemaScope]] process, he faced hostility from many theatre owners who had gone to great expense to convert their theatres to show [[3-D film]]s that Hollywood had stopped making. Zanuck assured them that they could have a large supply of CinemaScope product because Fox would make CinemaScope lenses available to other film companies and start a production unit, led by Lippert, called '''Regal Pictures''' in 1956 to produce [[B picture]]s in that process.\n\nLippert's company was contracted to make 20 pictures a year for seven years, each to be shot in seven days for no more than $100,000. Due to Lippert's problems with the film unions over not paying residuals to actors and writers of his films when they were sold to television, Ed Baumgarten was officially appointed the head of Regal, but Lippert had overall control.<ref>p.94 ''Maury Dexter Interview'' by Tom Weaver '' I Talked with a Zombie: Interviews with 23 Veterans of Horror and Sci-Fi'' McFarland</ref><ref>Dexter p 89</ref> Regal Pictures filmed its movies with CinemaScope lenses, but due to 20th Century-Fox insisting that only its \"A\" films would be labelled CinemaScope, Regal's product used the term \"Regalscope\" in its films' credits.<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/cslist.htm Widescreenmuseum.com]</ref>\n\nBeginning with ''[[Stagecoach to Fury]]'' (1956), Regal produced 25 pictures in its first year.<ref>By, T.

The films were entirely financed and released by Fox, but Regal was independent. Dexter says \"the only stipulation production-wise was that we had to give Bausch and Lomb screen credit on each film for CinemaScope camera lenses, as well as being charged back to Fox, $3,000 of each budget.<ref>Dexter p 88</ref>\n\nImpressed by the unit's profits, Fox extended Regal's contract by a further 16 films with an \"exploitation angle\" that would be approved by Fox.<ref>p.103 Dombrowski, Lisa ''The Films of Samuel Fuller: If You Die, I'll Kill You!''
