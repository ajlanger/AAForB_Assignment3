The philosophical difference between Maoism and Marxism\u2013Leninism is that the [[peasantry]] are the [[Vanguardism|revolutionary vanguard]] in pre-industrial societies rather than the [[proletariat]]. This updating and adaptation of Marxism\u2013Leninism to Chinese conditions in which revolutionary praxis is primary and ideological orthodoxy is secondary represents urban Marxism\u2013Leninism adapted to pre-industrial China.

''Mao's China and After'', New York:Free Press, 1999. pp. 12\u201316.</ref>\n\n==== Iconoclastic revolution and anti-Confucianism ====\nBy the turn of the 20th century, a proportionately small yet socially significant cross-section of China's traditional elite (i.e. landlords and bureaucrats) found themselves increasingly skeptical of the efficacy and even the moral validity of [[Confucianism]].<ref>Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 10.</ref> These skeptical iconoclasts formed a new segment of Chinese society, a modern intelligentsia whose arrival\u2014or as historian of China [[Maurice Meisner]] would label it, their defection\u2014heralded the beginning of the destruction of the [[gentry]] as a social class in China.<ref>Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 11.</ref>\n\nThe fall of the [[Qing dynasty|last imperial Chinese dynasty]] in 1911 marked the final failure of the Confucian moral order and it did much to make Confucianism synonymous with political and [[social conservatism]] in the minds of Chinese intellectuals. It was this association of conservatism and Confucianism which lent to the iconoclastic nature of Chinese intellectual thought during the first decades of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\">Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 14.</ref>\n\nChinese iconoclasm was expressed most clearly and vociferously by [[Chen Duxiu]] during the [[New Culture Movement]] which occurred between 1915 and 1919.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\"/> Proposing the \"total destruction of the traditions and values of the past\", the New Culture Movement was spearheaded by the ''[[New Youth]]'', a periodical which was published by Chen Duxiu and was profoundly influential on the young [[Mao Zedong]], whose first published work appeared on the magazine's pages.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\"/>\n\n==== Nationalism and the appeal of Marxism ====\nAlong with iconoclasm, radical anti-imperialism dominated the Chinese intellectual tradition and slowly evolved into a fierce nationalist fervor which influenced Mao's philosophy immensely and was crucial in adapting Marxism to the Chinese model.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 44\">Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 44.</ref> Vital to understanding Chinese nationalist sentiments of the time is the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which was signed in 1919. The Treaty aroused a wave of bitter nationalist resentment in Chinese intellectuals as lands formerly ceded to Germany in [[Shandong]] were\u2014without consultation with the Chinese\u2014transferred to Japanese control rather than returned to Chinese sovereignty.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17\">Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe negative reaction culminated in the [[May Fourth Movement|4 May Incident]] in 1919 during which a protest began with 3,000 students in Beijing displaying their anger at the announcement of the Versailles Treaty's concessions to Japan. The protest took a violent turn as protesters began attacking the homes and offices of ministers who were seen as cooperating with, or being in the direct pay of, the Japanese.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999.

Page 17\"/>\n\nAnother international event would have a large impact not only on Mao, but also on the Chinese intelligentsia. The [[Russian Revolution]] elicited great interest among Chinese intellectuals, although socialist revolution in China was not considered a viable option until after the May 4 Incident.<ref name=After>Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 18.</ref> Afterwards, \"[t]o become a Marxist was one way for a Chinese intellectual to reject both the traditions of the Chinese past and Western domination of the Chinese present\".<ref name=After/>\n\n=== Yan'an period between November 1935 and March 1947 ===\nDuring the period immediately following the [[Long March]], Mao and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) were headquartered in [[Yan'an]], which is a prefecture-level city in [[Shaanxi]] province. During this period, Mao clearly established himself as a Marxist theoretician and he produced the bulk of the works which would later be canonized into the \"thought of Mao Zedong\".<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45\">Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 45.</ref> The rudimentary philosophical base of Chinese Communist ideology is laid down in Mao's numerous dialectical treatises and it was conveyed to newly recruited party members. This period truly established ideological independence from Moscow for Mao and the CPC.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45\"/>\n\nAlthough the Yan'an period did answer some of the questions, both ideological and theoretical, which were raised by the Chinese Communist Revolution, it left many of the crucial questions unresolved, including how the Communist Party of China was supposed to launch a socialist revolution while completely separated from the urban sphere.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999.

Mao did not believe that education alone would bring about the transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Communism#Marxist communism|communism]] because of three main reasons. (1) Psychologically, the capitalists would not repent and turn towards communism on their own; (2) the rulers must be overthrown by the people; (3) \"the proletarians are discontented, and a demand for communism has arisen and had already become a fact\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 109.</ref> These reasons do not provide socioeconomic explanations, which usually form the core of Marxist ideology.\n\n; Formative Maoist period (1927\u20131935)\nIn this period, Mao avoided all theoretical implications in his literature and employed a minimum of Marxist category thought. His writings in this period failed to elaborate what he meant by the \"Marxist method of political and class analysis\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 111.</ref> Prior to this period, Mao was concerned with the dichotomy between knowledge and action. He was more concerned with the dichotomy between revolutionary ideology and counter-revolutionary objective conditions. There was more correlation drawn between China and the Soviet model.\n\n; Mature Maoist period (1935\u20131940)\nIntellectually, this was Mao's most fruitful time. The shift of orientation was apparent in his pamphlet ''Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War'' (December 1936). This pamphlet tried to provide a theoretical veneer for his concern with revolutionary practice.<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 113.</ref> Mao started to separate from the Soviet model since it was not automatically applicable to China. China's unique set of historical circumstances demanded a correspondingly unique application of Marxist theory, an application that would have to diverge from the Soviet approach.\n\n[[File:\u4e2d\u56fd\u9769\u547d\u6218\u4e89\u7684\u6218\u7565\u95ee\u989803531.jpg|thumb|''Strategic Issues in the Chinese Revolutionary War'' (1947)]]\n; Civil War period (1940\u20131949)\nUnlike the Mature period, this period was intellectually barren. Mao focused more on revolutionary practice and paid less attention to Marxist theory. He continued to emphasize theory as practice-oriented knowledge.<ref name=\"Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117\">Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 117.</ref> The biggest topic of theory he delved into was in connection with the [[Cheng Feng]] movement of 1942. It was here that Mao summarized the correlation between Marxist theory and Chinese practice: \"The target is the Chinese revolution, the arrow is Marxism\u2013Leninism. We Chinese communists seek this arrow for no other purpose than to hit the target of the Chinese revolution and the revolution of the east\".<ref name=\"Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117\"/> The only new emphasis was Mao's concern with two types of subjectivist deviation: (1) [[dogmatism]], the excessive reliance upon abstract theory; (2) [[empiricism]], excessive dependence on experience.\n\n; Post-1949 period following the revolutionary victory\nThe victory of 1949 was to Mao a confirmation of theory and practice. \"Optimism is the keynote to Mao's intellectual orientation in the post-1949 period\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 118.</ref> Mao assertively revised theory to relate it to the new practice of socialist construction. These revisions are apparent in the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction''. \"In the 1930s, when Mao talked about contradiction, he meant the contradiction between subjective thought and objective reality. In ''Dialectal Materialism'' of 1940, he saw idealism and materialism as two possible correlations between subjective thought and objective reality. In the 1940s, he introduced no new elements into his understanding of the subject-object contradiction. In the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction'', he saw contradiction as a universal principle underlying all processes of development, yet with each contradiction possessed of its own particularity\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 119.</ref>\n\n=== Differences from Marxism ===\nThe two differences between Maoism and [[Marxism]] are how the [[proletariat]] are defined and what political and economic conditions would start a [[communist revolution]]: \n# For [[Karl Marx]], the proletariat were the urban [[working class]], which was determined in the revolution by which the [[bourgeoisie]] overthrew [[feudalism]].<ref>Sandmo, Agnar. ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011, p.000.</ref> For Mao Zedong, the proletariat were the millions of peasants, to whom he referred as ''the popular masses''. Mao based his revolution upon the peasants, because they possessed two qualities: (i) they were poor, and (ii) they were a political blank slate; in Mao's words, \u201cA clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it\u201d.<ref>Gregor, A. James; Chang, Maria Hsia (1978). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1407255 \"Maoism and Marxism in Comparative Perspective\"]. ''The Review of Politics''. 40: 3. pp. 307\u2013327.</ref>\n# For Marx, [[proletarian revolution]] was internally fueled, by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]; that, as capitalism developed, \"a tension arises between the [[productive forces]] and the [[mode of production]]\".<ref>Sandmo, Agnar (2011). ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, p.000.</ref> The political tension between the productive forces (the workers) and the owners of the [[means of production]] (the capitalists) would be an inevitable incentive to proletarian revolution, which would result in a [[Communist society]] as the main economic structure. Mao did not subscribe to Marx's proposal of inevitable cyclicality in the economic system. His goal was to unify the Chinese nation and so realize progressive change for China in the form of Communism, hence, revolution was needed as soon as possible. In ''The Great Union of the Popular Masses'' (1919), Mao said: \"The decadence of the state, the sufferings of humanity, and the darkness of society have all reached an extreme\".<ref>Mao, Zedong.

Retrieved 25 April 2019.</ref>\n\n== Components ==\n=== New Democracy ===\n{{Marxism\u2013Leninism sidebar|variants}}\nThe theory of the [[New Democracy]] was known to the Chinese revolutionaries from the late 1940s. This thesis held that for the majority of the people of the planet, the long road to [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]] could only be opened by a \"national, popular, democratic, anti-feudal and anti-imperialist revolution, run by the communists\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Amin|first=Samir|title=The Countries of the South Must Take Their Own Independent Initiatives|publisher=The Third World Forum|date=October 2009|url=http://www.forumtiersmonde.net/fren/index.php/activitesactions/249-the-countries-of-the-south-must-take-their-own-independent-initiatives|accessdate=22 February 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723131304/http://www.forumtiersmonde.net/fren/index.php/activitesactions/249-the-countries-of-the-south-must-take-their-own-independent-initiatives|archivedate=23 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== People's war ===\nHolding that \"[[political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch05.htm|title=Quotations From Chairman Mao|publisher=Peking Foreign Languages Press|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> Maoism emphasizes the \"revolutionary struggle of the vast majority of people against the exploiting classes and their state structures\", which Mao termed a \"[[people's war]]\". Mobilizing large parts of rural populations to revolt against established institutions by engaging in [[guerrilla warfare]], Maoist Thought focuses on \"surrounding the cities from the countryside\".\n\nMaoism views the industrial-rural divide as a major division exploited by capitalism, identifying capitalism as involving industrial urban [[Developed country|developed]] [[First World]] societies ruling over rural [[Developing country|developing]] [[Third World]] societies.<ref>Alexander C. Cook, \"Third World Maoism\" in A Critical Introduction to Mao. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University, 2011. p. 290.</ref> Maoism identifies peasant insurgencies in particular national contexts were part of a context of world revolution, in which Maoism views the global countryside would overwhelm the global cities.<ref name=\"Mao.

Cambridge 2011. P. 289-290\"/>\n\n=== Mass line ===\nContrary to the [[Leninism|Leninist]] [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] model employed by the [[Bolshevik]]s, the theory of the [[mass line]] holds that party must not be separate from the popular masses, either in policy or in revolutionary struggle. To conduct a successful revolution the needs and demands of the masses must be told to the party so that the party can interpret them with a Marxist view.\n\n=== Cultural Revolution ===\nThe theory of the [[Cultural Revolution]] states that the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat does not wipe out bourgeois ideology\u2014the class-struggle continues and even intensifies during socialism, therefore a constant struggle against these ideologies and their social roots must be conducted. Cultural Revolution is directed also against traditionalism.\n\n=== Contradiction ===\nMao drew from the writings of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Joseph Stalin]] in elaborating his theory. Philosophically, his most important reflections emerge on the concept of \"contradiction\" (''maodun''). In two major essays, ''[[On Contradiction]]'' and ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'', he adopts the [[positivist]]-[[empiricist]] idea (shared by Engels) that contradiction is present in matter itself and thus also in the ideas of the brain. Matter always develops through a dialectical contradiction: \"The interdependence of the contradictory aspects present in all things and the struggle between these aspects determine the life of things and push their development forward. There is nothing that does not contain contradiction; without contradiction nothing would exist\".<ref>Mao Tse Tung, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm \"On contradiction\"], Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, Foreign Language Press, Peking, 1967, p. 75.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, each contradiction (including [[class struggle]], the contradiction holding between relations of production and the concrete development of forces of production) expresses itself in a series of other contradictions, some dominant, others not. \"There are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing, and one of them is necessarily the principal contradiction whose existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of the other contradictions\".<ref>Mao Tse-Tung, \"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm On contradiction]\", Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op. cit., p. 89.</ref>\n\nThus, the principal contradiction should be tackled with priority when trying to make the basic contradiction \"solidify\". Mao elaborates further on this theme in the essay ''[[On Practice]]'', \"on the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\". Here, ''Practice'' connects \"contradiction\" with \"class struggle\" in the following way, claiming that inside a mode of production there are three realms where practice functions: economic production, scientific experimentation (which also takes place in economic production and should not be radically disconnected from the former) and finally class struggle. These may be considered the proper objects of economy, scientific knowledge and politics.<ref>Cfr. Mao Tse-Tung, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_16.htm \"On practice. On the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\"], Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op.cit., p. 55: \"Man's social practice is not confined to activity in production, but takes many forms&mdash;class struggle, political life, scientific and artistic pursuits; in short, as a social being, man participates in all spheres of the practical life of society. Thus man, in varying degrees, comes to know the different relations between man and man, not only through his material life but also though his political and cultural life (both of which are intimately bound up with material life)\".</ref>\n\nThese three spheres deal with matter in its various forms, socially mediated. As a result, they are the only realms where knowledge may arise (since truth and knowledge only make sense in relation to matter, according to Marxist epistemology). Mao emphasizes&mdash;like Marx in trying to confront the \"bourgeois idealism\" of his time&mdash;that knowledge must be based on [[empirical evidence]].\n\nKnowledge results from hypotheses verified in the contrast with a real object; this real object, despite being mediated by the subject's theoretical frame, retains its materiality and will offer resistance to those ideas that do not conform to its truth. Thus in each of these realms (economic, scientific and political practice), contradictions (principle and secondary) must be identified, explored and put to function to achieve the communist goal. This involves the need to know, \"scientifically\", how the masses produce (how they live, think and work), to obtain knowledge of how class struggle (the main contradiction that articulates a mode of production, in its various realms) expresses itself.\n\nMao held that contradictions were the most important feature of society and since society is dominated by a wide range of contradictions, this calls for a wide range of varying strategies. Revolution is necessary to fully resolve antagonistic contradictions such as those between labour and capital. Contradictions arising within the revolutionary movement call for ideological correction to prevent them from becoming antagonistic.\n\n[[File:Mao Zedong in Red.svg|thumb|Maoism is described as being [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] adapted to Chinese conditions whereas its variant [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] is considered universally applicable]]\n\n=== Three Worlds Theory ===\n[[Three Worlds Theory]] states that during the [[Cold War]] two imperialist states formed the \"first world\"\u2014the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The second world consisted of the other imperialist states in their spheres of influence. The third world consisted of the non-imperialist countries. Both the first and the second world exploit the third world, but the first world is the most aggressive party. The workers in the first and second world are \"bought up\" by imperialism, preventing socialist revolution. On the other hand, the people of the third world have not even a short-sighted interest in the prevailing circumstances, hence revolution is most likely to appear in third world countries, which again will weaken imperialism opening up for revolutions in other countries too.<ref name=\"emg\">[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#maoism \"Maoism\"]. Glossary of Terms. ''Encyclopedia of Marxism''.</ref>\n\n=== Agrarian socialism ===\nMaoism departs from conventional European-inspired Marxism in that its focus is on the agrarian countryside, rather than the industrial urban forces\u2014this is known as [[agrarian socialism]]. Notably, Maoist parties in Peru, Nepal, and the Philippines have adopted equal stresses on urban and rural areas, depending on the country's focus of economic activity. Maoism broke with the framework of the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], dismissing it as \"[[State capitalism|state capitalist]]\" and \"[[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]]\", a pejorative term among communists referring to those who fight for capitalism in the name of socialism and who depart from [[Historical materialism|historical]] and [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nAlthough Maoism is critical of urban industrial capitalist powers, it views urban [[industrialization]] as a prerequisite to expand [[economic development]] and socialist reorganization to the countryside, with the goal being the achievement of rural industrialization that would abolish the distinction between town and countryside.<ref>John H. Badgley, John Wilson Lewis. Peasant Rebellion and Communist Revolution in Asia. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 1974. p. 249.</ref>\n\n== In China ==\nIn its post-revolutionary period, Mao Zedong Thought is defined in the CPC's Constitution as \"[[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] applied in a Chinese context\", synthesized by Mao and China's \"[[Generations of Chinese leadership|first-generation leaders]]\". It asserts that [[class struggle]] continues even if the [[proletariat]] has already overthrown the [[bourgeoisie]] and there are capitalist restorationist elements within the Communist Party itself. Maoism provided the CPC's first comprehensive theoretical guideline with regards to how to continue socialist revolution, the creation of a socialist society, socialist military construction and highlights various contradictions in society to be addressed by what is termed \"socialist construction\". While it continues to be lauded to be the major force that defeated \"imperialism and feudalism\" and created a \"New China\" by the Communist Party of China, the ideology survives only in name on the Communist Party's Constitution as [[Deng Xiaoping]] abolished most Maoist practices in 1978, advancing a guiding ideology called \"[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|title=Xinhua: Constitution of the Communist Party of China|website=news.xinhuanet.com|accessdate=10 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017214011/http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|archivedate=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== After Mao Zedong's death ==\n=== China ===\n[[File:Mao Zedong 1959 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]]]]\n[[File:Deng Xiaoping and Jimmy Carter at the arrival ceremony for the Vice Premier of China. - NARA - 183157-restored(cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Deng Xiaoping]]]]\nShortly after Mao's death in 1976, [[Deng Xiaoping]] initiated [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market reforms]] in 1978, thereby beginning the radical change in Mao's ideology in the People's Republic of China (PRC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|title=UC Berkeley Journalism -Faculty - Deng's Revolution|accessdate=22 August 2007|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104132630/http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|archivedate=4 January 2009}}</ref> Although Mao Zedong Thought nominally remains the state ideology, Deng's admonition to \"[[seek truth from facts]]\" means that state policies are judged on their practical consequences and in many areas the role of [[ideology]] in determining policy has thus been considerably reduced. Deng also separated Mao from Maoism, making it clear that Mao was fallible and hence the truth of Maoism comes from observing social consequences rather than by using Mao's quotations as [[Holy Writ|holy writ]], as was done in Mao's lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nContemporary Maoists in China criticize the social inequalities created by the revisionist Communist Party. Some Maoists say that Deng's ''[[Reform and Opening]]'' economic policies that introduced market principles spelled the end of Maoism in China, although Deng himself asserted that his reforms were upholding Mao Zedong Thought in accelerating the output of the country's [[productive forces]].\n\nIn addition, the party constitution has been rewritten to give the socialist ideas of Deng prominence over those of Mao. One consequence of this is that groups outside China which describe themselves as Maoist generally regard China as having repudiated Maoism and restoring [[capitalism]] and there is a wide perception both inside and outside China that China has abandoned Maoism. However, while it is now permissible to question particular actions of Mao and talk about excesses taken in the name of Maoism, there is a prohibition in China on either publicly questioning the validity of Maoism or on questioning whether the current actions of the CPC are \"Maoist\".\n\nAlthough Mao Zedong Thought is still listed as one of the [[Four Cardinal Principles]] of the People's Republic of China, its historical role has been re-assessed. The Communist Party now says that Maoism was necessary to break China free from its feudal past, but it also says that the actions of Mao are seen to have led to excesses during the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|official view]] is that China has now reached an economic and political stage, known as the [[primary stage of socialism]], in which China faces new and different problems completely unforeseen by Mao and as such the solutions that Mao advocated are no longer relevant to China's current conditions. The official proclamation of the new CPC stance came in June 1981, when the Sixth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee took place.

In the West and Third World, a plethora of parties and organizations were formed that upheld links to the CPC. Often they took names such as Communist Party (Marxist\u2013Leninist) or Revolutionary Communist Party to distinguish themselves from the traditional pro-Soviet communist parties. The pro-CPC movements were in many cases based among the wave of student radicalism that engulfed the world in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOnly one Western classic communist party sided with the CPC, the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]]. Under the leadership of the CPC and Mao Zedong, a parallel international communist movement emerged to rival that of the [[Soviets]], although it was never as formalized and homogeneous as the pro-Soviet tendency.\n\nAnother effort at regrouping the international communist movement is the [[International Conference of Marxist\u2013Leninist Parties and Organizations (International Newsletter)|International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations]] (ICMLPO). Three notable parties that participate in the ICMLPO are the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Germany]] (MLPD), the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) and [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Communist Organization \u2013 Proletarian Way]]. The ICMLPO seeks to unity around Marxism-Leninism, not Maoism. However, some of the parties and organizations within the ICMLPO identify as Mao Zedong Thought or Maoist.\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nThe [[Progressive Youth Organization]] was a Maoist organization in [[Afghanistan]].

The pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Belgium]] experienced a split of a Maoist wing under [[Jacques Grippa]]. The latter was a lower-ranking CPB member before the split, but Grippa rose in prominence as he formed a worthy internal Maoist opponent to the CPB leadership. His followers where sometimes referred to as Grippisten or Grippistes. When it became clear that the differences between the pro-Moscow leadership and the pro-Beijing wing were too great, Grippa and his entourage decided to split from the CPB and formed the [[Communist Party of Belgium \u2013 Marxist\u2013Leninist]] (PCBML). The PCBML had some influence, mostly in the heavily industrialized [[Borinage]] region of [[Wallonia]], but never managed to gather more support than the CPB. The latter held most of its leadership and base within the pro-Soviet camp. However, the PCBML was the first European Maoist party, and was recognized at the time of its foundation as the largest and most important Maoist organization in Europe outside of [[Albania]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjM-4ZG9iuMC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=pcbml+european+maoist+party&source=bl&ots=3WwrGN5owp&sig=ACfU3U02V3qK0mU9WsEzQhJvSbbQAhPMQQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiplaaqlY7lAhUwIjQIHcZfBkoQ6AEwCnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=pcbml%20european%20maoist%20party&f=false|title=Maoism in the Developed World|last=Alexander|first=Robert Jackson|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780275961480|location=|pages=59|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/world-outlook/v05n37-nov-17-1967-wo.pdf|title=End of the Road for Grippa?|last=|first=|date=17 November 1967|work=World Outlook|access-date=10 October 2019|page=930}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the PCBML never really gained a foothold in [[Flanders]], there was a reasonably successful Maoist movement in this region. Out of the student unions that formed in the wake of the May 1968 protests, Alle Macht Aan De Arbeiders (AMADA) or All Power To The Workers, was formed as a vanguard party-under-construction. This Maoist group originated mostly out of students from the universities of [[Leuven]] and [[Ghent]], but did manage to gain some influence among the striking miners during the shut-downs of the Belgian stonecoal mines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This group became the [[Workers' Party of Belgium]] (WPB) in 1979 and still exists today, although its power base has shifted somewhat from Flanders towards Wallonia. The WPB stayed loyal to the teachings of Mao for a long time, but after a general congress held in 2008 the party formally broke with its Maoist/Stalinist past.<ref>D.

''Mao's China and After'', New York:Free Press, 1999. pp. 12\u201316.</ref>\n\n==== Iconoclastic revolution and anti-Confucianism ====\nBy the turn of the 20th century, a proportionately small yet socially significant cross-section of China's traditional elite (i.e. landlords and bureaucrats) found themselves increasingly skeptical of the efficacy and even the moral validity of [[Confucianism]].<ref>Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 10.</ref> These skeptical iconoclasts formed a new segment of Chinese society, a modern intelligentsia whose arrival\u2014or as historian of China [[Maurice Meisner]] would label it, their defection\u2014heralded the beginning of the destruction of the [[gentry]] as a social class in China.<ref>Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 11.</ref>\n\nThe fall of the [[Qing dynasty|last imperial Chinese dynasty]] in 1911 marked the final failure of the Confucian moral order and it did much to make Confucianism synonymous with political and [[social conservatism]] in the minds of Chinese intellectuals. It was this association of conservatism and Confucianism which lent to the iconoclastic nature of Chinese intellectual thought during the first decades of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\">Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 14.</ref>\n\nChinese iconoclasm was expressed most clearly and vociferously by [[Chen Duxiu]] during the [[New Culture Movement]] which occurred between 1915 and 1919.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\"/> Proposing the \"total destruction of the traditions and values of the past\", the New Culture Movement was spearheaded by the ''[[New Youth]]'', a periodical which was published by Chen Duxiu and was profoundly influential on the young [[Mao Zedong]], whose first published work appeared on the magazine's pages.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\"/>\n\n==== Nationalism and the appeal of Marxism ====\nAlong with iconoclasm, radical anti-imperialism dominated the Chinese intellectual tradition and slowly evolved into a fierce nationalist fervor which influenced Mao's philosophy immensely and was crucial in adapting Marxism to the Chinese model.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 44\">Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 44.</ref> Vital to understanding Chinese nationalist sentiments of the time is the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which was signed in 1919. The Treaty aroused a wave of bitter nationalist resentment in Chinese intellectuals as lands formerly ceded to Germany in [[Shandong]] were\u2014without consultation with the Chinese\u2014transferred to Japanese control rather than returned to Chinese sovereignty.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17\">Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe negative reaction culminated in the [[May Fourth Movement|4 May Incident]] in 1919 during which a protest began with 3,000 students in Beijing displaying their anger at the announcement of the Versailles Treaty's concessions to Japan. The protest took a violent turn as protesters began attacking the homes and offices of ministers who were seen as cooperating with, or being in the direct pay of, the Japanese.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999.

Page 17\"/>\n\nAnother international event would have a large impact not only on Mao, but also on the Chinese intelligentsia. The [[Russian Revolution]] elicited great interest among Chinese intellectuals, although socialist revolution in China was not considered a viable option until after the May 4 Incident.<ref name=After>Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 18.</ref> Afterwards, \"[t]o become a Marxist was one way for a Chinese intellectual to reject both the traditions of the Chinese past and Western domination of the Chinese present\".<ref name=After/>\n\n=== Yan'an period between November 1935 and March 1947 ===\nDuring the period immediately following the [[Long March]], Mao and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) were headquartered in [[Yan'an]], which is a prefecture-level city in [[Shaanxi]] province. During this period, Mao clearly established himself as a Marxist theoretician and he produced the bulk of the works which would later be canonized into the \"thought of Mao Zedong\".<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45\">Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 45.</ref> The rudimentary philosophical base of Chinese Communist ideology is laid down in Mao's numerous dialectical treatises and it was conveyed to newly recruited party members. This period truly established ideological independence from Moscow for Mao and the CPC.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45\"/>\n\nAlthough the Yan'an period did answer some of the questions, both ideological and theoretical, which were raised by the Chinese Communist Revolution, it left many of the crucial questions unresolved, including how the Communist Party of China was supposed to launch a socialist revolution while completely separated from the urban sphere.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999.

Mao did not believe that education alone would bring about the transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Communism#Marxist communism|communism]] because of three main reasons. (1) Psychologically, the capitalists would not repent and turn towards communism on their own; (2) the rulers must be overthrown by the people; (3) \"the proletarians are discontented, and a demand for communism has arisen and had already become a fact\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 109.</ref> These reasons do not provide socioeconomic explanations, which usually form the core of Marxist ideology.\n\n; Formative Maoist period (1927\u20131935)\nIn this period, Mao avoided all theoretical implications in his literature and employed a minimum of Marxist category thought. His writings in this period failed to elaborate what he meant by the \"Marxist method of political and class analysis\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 111.</ref> Prior to this period, Mao was concerned with the dichotomy between knowledge and action. He was more concerned with the dichotomy between revolutionary ideology and counter-revolutionary objective conditions. There was more correlation drawn between China and the Soviet model.\n\n; Mature Maoist period (1935\u20131940)\nIntellectually, this was Mao's most fruitful time. The shift of orientation was apparent in his pamphlet ''Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War'' (December 1936). This pamphlet tried to provide a theoretical veneer for his concern with revolutionary practice.<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 113.</ref> Mao started to separate from the Soviet model since it was not automatically applicable to China. China's unique set of historical circumstances demanded a correspondingly unique application of Marxist theory, an application that would have to diverge from the Soviet approach.\n\n[[File:\u4e2d\u56fd\u9769\u547d\u6218\u4e89\u7684\u6218\u7565\u95ee\u989803531.jpg|thumb|''Strategic Issues in the Chinese Revolutionary War'' (1947)]]\n; Civil War period (1940\u20131949)\nUnlike the Mature period, this period was intellectually barren. Mao focused more on revolutionary practice and paid less attention to Marxist theory. He continued to emphasize theory as practice-oriented knowledge.<ref name=\"Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117\">Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 117.</ref> The biggest topic of theory he delved into was in connection with the [[Cheng Feng]] movement of 1942. It was here that Mao summarized the correlation between Marxist theory and Chinese practice: \"The target is the Chinese revolution, the arrow is Marxism\u2013Leninism. We Chinese communists seek this arrow for no other purpose than to hit the target of the Chinese revolution and the revolution of the east\".<ref name=\"Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117\"/> The only new emphasis was Mao's concern with two types of subjectivist deviation: (1) [[dogmatism]], the excessive reliance upon abstract theory; (2) [[empiricism]], excessive dependence on experience.\n\n; Post-1949 period following the revolutionary victory\nThe victory of 1949 was to Mao a confirmation of theory and practice. \"Optimism is the keynote to Mao's intellectual orientation in the post-1949 period\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 118.</ref> Mao assertively revised theory to relate it to the new practice of socialist construction. These revisions are apparent in the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction''. \"In the 1930s, when Mao talked about contradiction, he meant the contradiction between subjective thought and objective reality. In ''Dialectal Materialism'' of 1940, he saw idealism and materialism as two possible correlations between subjective thought and objective reality. In the 1940s, he introduced no new elements into his understanding of the subject-object contradiction. In the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction'', he saw contradiction as a universal principle underlying all processes of development, yet with each contradiction possessed of its own particularity\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 119.</ref>\n\n=== Differences from Marxism ===\nThe two differences between Maoism and [[Marxism]] are how the [[proletariat]] are defined and what political and economic conditions would start a [[communist revolution]]: \n# For [[Karl Marx]], the proletariat were the urban [[working class]], which was determined in the revolution by which the [[bourgeoisie]] overthrew [[feudalism]].<ref>Sandmo, Agnar. ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011, p.000.</ref> For Mao Zedong, the proletariat were the millions of peasants, to whom he referred as ''the popular masses''. Mao based his revolution upon the peasants, because they possessed two qualities: (i) they were poor, and (ii) they were a political blank slate; in Mao's words, \u201cA clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it\u201d.<ref>Gregor, A. James; Chang, Maria Hsia (1978). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1407255 \"Maoism and Marxism in Comparative Perspective\"]. ''The Review of Politics''. 40: 3. pp. 307\u2013327.</ref>\n# For Marx, [[proletarian revolution]] was internally fueled, by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]; that, as capitalism developed, \"a tension arises between the [[productive forces]] and the [[mode of production]]\".<ref>Sandmo, Agnar (2011). ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, p.000.</ref> The political tension between the productive forces (the workers) and the owners of the [[means of production]] (the capitalists) would be an inevitable incentive to proletarian revolution, which would result in a [[Communist society]] as the main economic structure. Mao did not subscribe to Marx's proposal of inevitable cyclicality in the economic system. His goal was to unify the Chinese nation and so realize progressive change for China in the form of Communism, hence, revolution was needed as soon as possible.

Mobilizing large parts of rural populations to revolt against established institutions by engaging in [[guerrilla warfare]], Maoist Thought focuses on \"surrounding the cities from the countryside\".\n\nMaoism views the industrial-rural divide as a major division exploited by capitalism, identifying capitalism as involving industrial urban [[Developed country|developed]] [[First World]] societies ruling over rural [[Developing country|developing]] [[Third World]] societies.<ref>Alexander C.

To conduct a successful revolution the needs and demands of the masses must be told to the party so that the party can interpret them with a Marxist view.\n\n=== Cultural Revolution ===\nThe theory of the [[Cultural Revolution]] states that the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat does not wipe out bourgeois ideology\u2014the class-struggle continues and even intensifies during socialism, therefore a constant struggle against these ideologies and their social roots must be conducted. Cultural Revolution is directed also against traditionalism.\n\n=== Contradiction ===\nMao drew from the writings of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Joseph Stalin]] in elaborating his theory. Philosophically, his most important reflections emerge on the concept of \"contradiction\" (''maodun''). In two major essays, ''[[On Contradiction]]'' and ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'', he adopts the [[positivist]]-[[empiricist]] idea (shared by Engels) that contradiction is present in matter itself and thus also in the ideas of the brain. Matter always develops through a dialectical contradiction: \"The interdependence of the contradictory aspects present in all things and the struggle between these aspects determine the life of things and push their development forward. There is nothing that does not contain contradiction; without contradiction nothing would exist\".<ref>Mao Tse Tung, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm \"On contradiction\"], Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, Foreign Language Press, Peking, 1967, p. 75.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, each contradiction (including [[class struggle]], the contradiction holding between relations of production and the concrete development of forces of production) expresses itself in a series of other contradictions, some dominant, others not. \"There are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing, and one of them is necessarily the principal contradiction whose existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of the other contradictions\".<ref>Mao Tse-Tung, \"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm On contradiction]\", Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op. cit., p. 89.</ref>\n\nThus, the principal contradiction should be tackled with priority when trying to make the basic contradiction \"solidify\". Mao elaborates further on this theme in the essay ''[[On Practice]]'', \"on the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\". Here, ''Practice'' connects \"contradiction\" with \"class struggle\" in the following way, claiming that inside a mode of production there are three realms where practice functions: economic production, scientific experimentation (which also takes place in economic production and should not be radically disconnected from the former) and finally class struggle. These may be considered the proper objects of economy, scientific knowledge and politics.<ref>Cfr. Mao Tse-Tung, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_16.htm \"On practice. On the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\"], Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op.cit., p. 55: \"Man's social practice is not confined to activity in production, but takes many forms&mdash;class struggle, political life, scientific and artistic pursuits; in short, as a social being, man participates in all spheres of the practical life of society. Thus man, in varying degrees, comes to know the different relations between man and man, not only through his material life but also though his political and cultural life (both of which are intimately bound up with material life)\".</ref>\n\nThese three spheres deal with matter in its various forms, socially mediated. As a result, they are the only realms where knowledge may arise (since truth and knowledge only make sense in relation to matter, according to Marxist epistemology). Mao emphasizes&mdash;like Marx in trying to confront the \"bourgeois idealism\" of his time&mdash;that knowledge must be based on [[empirical evidence]].\n\nKnowledge results from hypotheses verified in the contrast with a real object; this real object, despite being mediated by the subject's theoretical frame, retains its materiality and will offer resistance to those ideas that do not conform to its truth. Thus in each of these realms (economic, scientific and political practice), contradictions (principle and secondary) must be identified, explored and put to function to achieve the communist goal. This involves the need to know, \"scientifically\", how the masses produce (how they live, think and work), to obtain knowledge of how class struggle (the main contradiction that articulates a mode of production, in its various realms) expresses itself.\n\nMao held that contradictions were the most important feature of society and since society is dominated by a wide range of contradictions, this calls for a wide range of varying strategies. Revolution is necessary to fully resolve antagonistic contradictions such as those between labour and capital. Contradictions arising within the revolutionary movement call for ideological correction to prevent them from becoming antagonistic.\n\n[[File:Mao Zedong in Red.svg|thumb|Maoism is described as being [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] adapted to Chinese conditions whereas its variant [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] is considered universally applicable]]\n\n=== Three Worlds Theory ===\n[[Three Worlds Theory]] states that during the [[Cold War]] two imperialist states formed the \"first world\"\u2014the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The second world consisted of the other imperialist states in their spheres of influence. The third world consisted of the non-imperialist countries. Both the first and the second world exploit the third world, but the first world is the most aggressive party. The workers in the first and second world are \"bought up\" by imperialism, preventing socialist revolution. On the other hand, the people of the third world have not even a short-sighted interest in the prevailing circumstances, hence revolution is most likely to appear in third world countries, which again will weaken imperialism opening up for revolutions in other countries too.<ref name=\"emg\">[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#maoism \"Maoism\"]. Glossary of Terms. ''Encyclopedia of Marxism''.</ref>\n\n=== Agrarian socialism ===\nMaoism departs from conventional European-inspired Marxism in that its focus is on the agrarian countryside, rather than the industrial urban forces\u2014this is known as [[agrarian socialism]]. Notably, Maoist parties in Peru, Nepal, and the Philippines have adopted equal stresses on urban and rural areas, depending on the country's focus of economic activity. Maoism broke with the framework of the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], dismissing it as \"[[State capitalism|state capitalist]]\" and \"[[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]]\", a pejorative term among communists referring to those who fight for capitalism in the name of socialism and who depart from [[Historical materialism|historical]] and [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nAlthough Maoism is critical of urban industrial capitalist powers, it views urban [[industrialization]] as a prerequisite to expand [[economic development]] and socialist reorganization to the countryside, with the goal being the achievement of rural industrialization that would abolish the distinction between town and countryside.<ref>John H. Badgley, John Wilson Lewis. Peasant Rebellion and Communist Revolution in Asia. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 1974. p. 249.</ref>\n\n== In China ==\nIn its post-revolutionary period, Mao Zedong Thought is defined in the CPC's Constitution as \"[[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] applied in a Chinese context\", synthesized by Mao and China's \"[[Generations of Chinese leadership|first-generation leaders]]\". It asserts that [[class struggle]] continues even if the [[proletariat]] has already overthrown the [[bourgeoisie]] and there are capitalist restorationist elements within the Communist Party itself. Maoism provided the CPC's first comprehensive theoretical guideline with regards to how to continue socialist revolution, the creation of a socialist society, socialist military construction and highlights various contradictions in society to be addressed by what is termed \"socialist construction\". While it continues to be lauded to be the major force that defeated \"imperialism and feudalism\" and created a \"New China\" by the Communist Party of China, the ideology survives only in name on the Communist Party's Constitution as [[Deng Xiaoping]] abolished most Maoist practices in 1978, advancing a guiding ideology called \"[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|title=Xinhua: Constitution of the Communist Party of China|website=news.xinhuanet.com|accessdate=10 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017214011/http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|archivedate=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== After Mao Zedong's death ==\n=== China ===\n[[File:Mao Zedong 1959 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]]]]\n[[File:Deng Xiaoping and Jimmy Carter at the arrival ceremony for the Vice Premier of China. - NARA - 183157-restored(cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Deng Xiaoping]]]]\nShortly after Mao's death in 1976, [[Deng Xiaoping]] initiated [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market reforms]] in 1978, thereby beginning the radical change in Mao's ideology in the People's Republic of China (PRC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|title=UC Berkeley Journalism -Faculty - Deng's Revolution|accessdate=22 August 2007|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104132630/http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|archivedate=4 January 2009}}</ref> Although Mao Zedong Thought nominally remains the state ideology, Deng's admonition to \"[[seek truth from facts]]\" means that state policies are judged on their practical consequences and in many areas the role of [[ideology]] in determining policy has thus been considerably reduced. Deng also separated Mao from Maoism, making it clear that Mao was fallible and hence the truth of Maoism comes from observing social consequences rather than by using Mao's quotations as [[Holy Writ|holy writ]], as was done in Mao's lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nContemporary Maoists in China criticize the social inequalities created by the revisionist Communist Party. Some Maoists say that Deng's ''[[Reform and Opening]]'' economic policies that introduced market principles spelled the end of Maoism in China, although Deng himself asserted that his reforms were upholding Mao Zedong Thought in accelerating the output of the country's [[productive forces]].\n\nIn addition, the party constitution has been rewritten to give the socialist ideas of Deng prominence over those of Mao. One consequence of this is that groups outside China which describe themselves as Maoist generally regard China as having repudiated Maoism and restoring [[capitalism]] and there is a wide perception both inside and outside China that China has abandoned Maoism. However, while it is now permissible to question particular actions of Mao and talk about excesses taken in the name of Maoism, there is a prohibition in China on either publicly questioning the validity of Maoism or on questioning whether the current actions of the CPC are \"Maoist\".\n\nAlthough Mao Zedong Thought is still listed as one of the [[Four Cardinal Principles]] of the People's Republic of China, its historical role has been re-assessed. The Communist Party now says that Maoism was necessary to break China free from its feudal past, but it also says that the actions of Mao are seen to have led to excesses during the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|official view]] is that China has now reached an economic and political stage, known as the [[primary stage of socialism]], in which China faces new and different problems completely unforeseen by Mao and as such the solutions that Mao advocated are no longer relevant to China's current conditions. The official proclamation of the new CPC stance came in June 1981, when the Sixth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee took place. The 35,000-word ''Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China'' reads: <blockquote>Chief responsibility for the grave 'Left' error of the 'cultural revolution,' an error comprehensive in magnitude and protracted in duration, does indeed lie with Comrade Mao Zedong...

Many of the foreign parties that were [[fraternal party|fraternal parties]] aligned with the Chinese government before 1975 either disbanded, abandoned the new Chinese government entirely, or even renounced [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and developed into non-communist, [[social democratic]] parties.

In the West and Third World, a plethora of parties and organizations were formed that upheld links to the CPC. Often they took names such as Communist Party (Marxist\u2013Leninist) or Revolutionary Communist Party to distinguish themselves from the traditional pro-Soviet communist parties. The pro-CPC movements were in many cases based among the wave of student radicalism that engulfed the world in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOnly one Western classic communist party sided with the CPC, the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]]. Under the leadership of the CPC and Mao Zedong, a parallel international communist movement emerged to rival that of the [[Soviets]], although it was never as formalized and homogeneous as the pro-Soviet tendency.\n\nAnother effort at regrouping the international communist movement is the [[International Conference of Marxist\u2013Leninist Parties and Organizations (International Newsletter)|International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations]] (ICMLPO). Three notable parties that participate in the ICMLPO are the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Germany]] (MLPD), the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) and [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Communist Organization \u2013 Proletarian Way]]. The ICMLPO seeks to unity around Marxism-Leninism, not Maoism. However, some of the parties and organizations within the ICMLPO identify as Mao Zedong Thought or Maoist.\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nThe [[Progressive Youth Organization]] was a Maoist organization in [[Afghanistan]].

The pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Belgium]] experienced a split of a Maoist wing under [[Jacques Grippa]]. The latter was a lower-ranking CPB member before the split, but Grippa rose in prominence as he formed a worthy internal Maoist opponent to the CPB leadership. His followers where sometimes referred to as Grippisten or Grippistes. When it became clear that the differences between the pro-Moscow leadership and the pro-Beijing wing were too great, Grippa and his entourage decided to split from the CPB and formed the [[Communist Party of Belgium \u2013 Marxist\u2013Leninist]] (PCBML). The PCBML had some influence, mostly in the heavily industrialized [[Borinage]] region of [[Wallonia]], but never managed to gather more support than the CPB. The latter held most of its leadership and base within the pro-Soviet camp. However, the PCBML was the first European Maoist party, and was recognized at the time of its foundation as the largest and most important Maoist organization in Europe outside of [[Albania]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjM-4ZG9iuMC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=pcbml+european+maoist+party&source=bl&ots=3WwrGN5owp&sig=ACfU3U02V3qK0mU9WsEzQhJvSbbQAhPMQQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiplaaqlY7lAhUwIjQIHcZfBkoQ6AEwCnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=pcbml%20european%20maoist%20party&f=false|title=Maoism in the Developed World|last=Alexander|first=Robert Jackson|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780275961480|location=|pages=59|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/world-outlook/v05n37-nov-17-1967-wo.pdf|title=End of the Road for Grippa?|last=|first=|date=17 November 1967|work=World Outlook|access-date=10 October 2019|page=930}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the PCBML never really gained a foothold in [[Flanders]], there was a reasonably successful Maoist movement in this region. Out of the student unions that formed in the wake of the May 1968 protests, Alle Macht Aan De Arbeiders (AMADA) or All Power To The Workers, was formed as a vanguard party-under-construction. This Maoist group originated mostly out of students from the universities of [[Leuven]] and [[Ghent]], but did manage to gain some influence among the striking miners during the shut-downs of the Belgian stonecoal mines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This group became the [[Workers' Party of Belgium]] (WPB) in 1979 and still exists today, although its power base has shifted somewhat from Flanders towards Wallonia. The WPB stayed loyal to the teachings of Mao for a long time, but after a general congress held in 2008 the party formally broke with its Maoist/Stalinist past.<ref>D.

The CPI (Maoist) is designated as a terrorist organisation in India under [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maoists-fourth-deadliest-terror-outfit-after-taliban-is-boko-haram-report/articleshow/54354196.cms|title=Maoists fourth deadliest terror outfit after Taliban, IS, Boko Haram: Report}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/864540/are-all-terrorists-really-muslims/|title=Are all terrorists really Muslims?|quote=Most terrorists in India are Hindus, the ones whom we have conveniently labelled 'Maoist' instead of 'Hindu'.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/718458/most-extremists-in-india-are-not-muslim-they-are-hindu|title=Most extremists in India are not Muslim \u2013 they are Hindu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/are-most-terrorists-in-india-muslims/293911|title=Are Most Terrorists In India Muslims?}}</ref>\n\n=== Iran ===\n{{main|1982 Amol uprising}}\nThe [[Union of Iranian Communists (Sarbedaran)]] was an [[Iran]] Maoist organization. The UIC (S) was formed in 1976 after the alliance of a number of Maoist groups carrying out military actions within Iran. In 1982, the UIC (S) mobilized forces in forests around [[Amol]] and launched an insurgency against the Islamist Government. The uprising was eventually a failure and many UIC (S) leaders were shot.\n\n=== Palestine ===\nThe [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] is a Maoist political and military organization. The DFLP's original political orientation was based on the view that Palestinian national goals could be achieved only through revolution of the masses and [[people's war]].\n\n=== Philippines ===\n{{main|Communist Party of the Philippines}}\nThe [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] is the largest communist party in the Philippines, active since December 26, 1968 (Mao's birthday). It was formed as a result of the [[First Great Rectification Movement]] and a split between the old [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930]] which the founders saw as revisionist. The CPP was formed on Maoist lines in stark contrast with the old PKP which put primary focus to the parliamentary struggle. The CPP was founded by [[Jose Maria Sison]] and other cadres from the old party.<ref name=\"saulo\">{{cite book|last=Saulo|first=Alfredo|title=Communism in the Philippines}}</ref>\n\nThe CPP also has an armed wing which it exercises absolute control over, namely the [[New People's Army]]. It currently wages a guerrilla war against the government of the Republic of the Philippines in the countryside and is still currently active. Both the CPP and the NPA are part of the [[National Democratic Front of the Philippines]], a consolidation of Maoist sectoral organizations such as [[Kabataang Makabayan]] as part of the united front strategy. The NDFP also represents the people's democratic government in peace talks.<ref name=\"cppsbp\">{{cite book|title=Constitution and Program|publisher=Communist Party of the Philippines|edition=2016|url=https://www.philippinerevolution.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2016-CPP-consti-ppdr_en.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Portugal ===\n[[File:Flag of For\u00e7as Populares 25 de Abril.svg|thumb|The flag of [[For\u00e7as Populares 25 de Abril|FP-25]]]]\nMaoist movements in Portugal were very active during the 1970s, especially during the [[Carnation Revolution]] that led to the fall of the fascist government the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] in 1974.\n\nThe largest Maoist movement in Portugal was the [[Portuguese Workers' Communist Party]]. The party was among the most active resistance movements before the [[Carnation Revolution|Portuguese democratic revolution of 1974]], especially among students of Lisbon. After the revolution, the MRPP achieved fame for its large and highly artistic mural paintings.\n\nIntensely active during 1974 and 1975, during that time the party had members that later came to be very important in national politics. For example, a future Prime Minister of Portugal, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso]] was active within Maoist movements in Portugal and identified as a Maoist. In the 1980s, the [[For\u00e7as Populares 25 de Abril]] was another far-left Maoist armed organization operating in Portugal between 1980 and 1987 with the goal of creating socialism in post-[[Carnation Revolution]] Portugal.\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe [[Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted)]] was a [[Spain|Spanish]] clandestine Maoist party. The armed wing of the party was [[First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups]].\n\n===Sweden===\nIn 1968, a small extremist Maoist sect called Rebellerna (\"The Rebels\") was established in [[Stockholm]]. Lead by [[Francisco Sarri\u00f3n]], the group unsuccessfully demanded the Chinese embassy to admit them into the Communist Party of China. The organization only lasted a few months.<ref>{{cite book |last1=S\u00e4fve |first1=Torbj\u00f6rn |title=Rebellerna i Sverige.

It was founded in 1972 with [[\u0130brahim Kaypakkaya]] as its first leader. The armed wing of the party is named the Workers' and Peasants' Liberation Army in Turkey (TIKKO).\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Main|Category:Maoist organisations in the United Kingdom}}\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States during the late 1960s, parts of the emerging [[New Left]] rejected the Marxism espoused by the Soviet Union and instead adopted pro-Chinese communism.\n\nThe [[Black Panther Party]], especially under the leadership of [[Huey Newton]], was influenced by Mao Zedong's ideas. Into the 1970s, Maoists in the United States, e.g. Maoist representative Jon Lux, formed a large part of the [[New Communist movement]].\n\nThe [[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA]] is also a Maoist movement.\n\n== Criticism and implementation ==\n[[File:ForbiddenCity MaoZedongPortrait (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|Despite falling out of favor within the [[Communist Party of China]] by 1978, Mao is still revered, with Deng's famous \"70% right, 30% wrong\" line]]\nMaoism has fallen out of favour within the Communist Party of China, beginning with Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 1978. Deng believed that Maoism showed the dangers of \"ultra-leftism\", manifested in the harm perpetrated by the various mass movements that characterized the Maoist era. In Chinese communism, the term \"left\" can be taken as a euphemism for Maoist policies. However, Deng stated that the revolutionary side of Maoism should be considered separate from the governance side, leading to his famous epithet that Mao was \"70% right, 30% wrong\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ips-journal.eu/in-focus/the-politics-of-memory/article/show/70-per-cent-good-30-per-cent-bad-2216/|title=70 per cent good, 30 per cent bad|publisher=}}</ref> Chinese scholars generally agree that Deng's interpretation of Maoism preserves the legitimacy of Communist rule in China, but at the same time criticizes Mao's brand of economic and political governance.\n\nCritic Graham Young says that Maoists see [[Joseph Stalin]] as the last true socialist leader of the Soviet Union, but allows that the Maoist assessments of Stalin vary between the extremely positive and the more ambivalent.<ref>Graham Young, ''On Socialist Development and the Two Roads'', The Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs, No. 8 (July 1982), pp. 75\u201384, {{doi|10.2307/2158927}}.</ref> Some political philosophers, such as Martin Cohen, have seen in Maoism an attempt to combine [[Confucianism]] and [[socialism]]\u2014what one such called \"a third way between communism and capitalism\".<ref>Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao, by Martin Cohen, p. 206, published 2001 by Pluto Press, London and Sterling VA {{ISBN|0-7453-1603-4}}.</ref>\n\n[[Enver Hoxha]] critiqued Maoism from a Marxist\u2013Leninist perspective, arguing that New Democracy halts class struggle,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch6.htm|title=Enver Hoxha: Imperialism and the Revolution (1979)|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref> the theory of the three worlds is \"counter-revolutionary\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch4.htm|title=Enver Hoxha: Imperialism and the Revolution (1979)|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref> and questioned Mao's guerilla warfare methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch3.htm|title=Enver Hoxha: Imperialism and the Revolution (1979)|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>\n\nSome say Mao departed from Leninism not only in his near-total lack of interest in the urban working class, but also in his concept of the nature and role of the party. For Lenin, the party was sacrosanct because it was the incarnation of the \"proletarian consciousness\" and there was no question about who were the teachers and who were the pupils. On the other hand, for Mao this question would always be virtually impossible to answer.<ref>\"Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After.

These notions were what prompted him to investigate the peasant uprisings in Hunan while the rest of China's communists were in the cities and focused on the orthodox Marxist proletariat.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 43\">Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After.

Page 44\"/> The concept of \"[[people's war]]\" which is so central to Maoist thought is directly populist in its origins. Mao believed that intellectuals and party cadres had to become first students of the masses to become teachers of the masses later. This concept was vital to the strategy of the aforementioned \"people's war\".<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999.

Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 42.</ref> Mao truly believed that China was to play a crucial preliminary role in the socialist revolution internationally. This belief, or the fervor with which Mao held it, separated Mao from the other Chinese communists and led Mao onto the path of what [[Leon Trotsky]] called \"Messianic Revolutionary Nationalism\", which was central to his personal philosophy.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999.
