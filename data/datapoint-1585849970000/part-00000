In a career lasting from 1981 to 2004, he is best known for his time playing for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He won 75 caps for the [[England national football team]], and is the country's second-most capped goalkeeper, after [[Peter Shilton]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamGkprs/GkprsMstApps.html |title=England's Goalkeepers in Most Appearance Order |work=England Football Online}}</ref> In 1997, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for services to football.\n\nThe peak of Seaman's career was during his period as Arsenal and England goalkeeper in the 1990s and early 2000s. During his time at Arsenal he won three league championships (1991, 1998, 2002), four [[FA Cup]]s (1993, 1998, 2002, 2003), the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1993 and the [[Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners Cup]] in 1994. During this time he also played for England in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]s, and [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]]. As well as Arsenal, he also played in the [[Premier League]] for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], as well as making appearances in the [[Football League]] for [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], Birmingham City and Queens Park Rangers.\n\nHis save from [[Paul Peschisolido]] of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[2002\u201303 FA Cup]] was described as one of the best ever. Notable lows came with two costly errors, both from long-range efforts\u2014conceding a [[last-minute goal]] in the [[1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final]] to [[Nayim]] and conceding to a [[Ronaldinho]] free-kick in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wallace |first=Sam |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2371241/Seaman-calls-time-on-career.html |title=Seaman calls time on career |publisher=Telegraph |date=2004-01-13 |accessdate=2009-05-20 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/photo_galleries/3394471.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; Football &#124; Photo Galleries &#124; David Seaman's career in photos |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-01-13 |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/seamans-career-meets-unsatisfying-conclusion-573082.html |title=Seaman's career meets unsatisfying conclusion&nbsp;\u2013 Premier League, Football |publisher=The Independent |date= 2004-01-14|accessdate=2009-05-20 | location=London | first=Jason | last=Burt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-7.-david-seaman |title=Gunners' Greatest Players&nbsp;\u2013 7.

He retired in 2004 due to a recurring shoulder injury. In June 2012, he was appointed goalkeeping coach of [[Combined Counties League]] club [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nSeaman was born in [[Rotherham]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]<!-- not South Yorkshire, which didn't exist until 11 years after Seaman's birth -->. He attended [[Kimberworth Comprehensive School]].<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article130783.ece ]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref> He began his career at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], the club he supported as a boy. However (much to his disappointment), he was not wanted by then-manager [[Eddie Gray (footballer born 1948)|Eddie Gray]], who had been his favourite player. Seaman went to Division 4 club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] for a \u00a34,000 fee in August 1982, where he began to make a name for himself.\n\nJust over two years later, in October 1984, [[Football League Championship|Second Division]] [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] paid \u00a3100,000 for Seaman's services. They ended up winning [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] at the end of that season, but were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] again at the end of the following season. Seaman was not to follow them back to Division Two, however.\n\nIn August 1986, Seaman moved to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] for \u00a3225,000. Playing in a higher profile club on a plastic pitch, he earned his first England cap, which came under [[Bobby Robson]] in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in November 1988. Whilst at QPR, Seaman was coached by Arsenal double-winner (of 1971) [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]], who was to work with him for more than a decade.\n\n=== Arsenal ===\nIn 1990, long before the current [[transfer window]] system had come to English football, there was still a transfer deadline a few weeks before the end of the season. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], who had won the league in 1989, wanted to sign Seaman, but the deal involved Arsenal's keeper [[John Lukic]] heading the opposite way on loan. Lukic did not want to do this, and the deal broke down and remained unresolved when the deadline passed. As soon as the season ended and clubs were allowed to buy players again, Arsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] came back for Seaman, with \u00a31.3 million (at the time a British record for a goalkeeper)<ref>{{cite news |last=Rich |first=Tim |date=13 May 2003 |title=Seaman's standing unfairly undermined by rare mistakes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/seamans-standing-unfairly-undermined-by-rare-mistakes-590470.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> being the agreed fee. Lukic, who was highly popular amongst Arsenal fans, left to rejoin Leeds.\n\nSeaman's time at Arsenal coincided with one of the most successful periods in the club's history. The [[1990\u201391 Arsenal F.C. season|1990\u201391 season]] saw Seaman concede only 18 goals when playing in every match of the 38-game season as Arsenal regained the [[List of English football champions|league title]].\n\nArsenal won both the [[1992\u201393 FA Cup|FA Cup]] and the [[1992\u201393 Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1993 and supplemented this a year later with the [[1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]. Arsenal began their victorious League Cup campaign against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and after two legs the game went to a penalty shootout. Seaman saved three of the four Millwall penalties from [[Malcolm Allen (footballer)|Malcolm Allen]], [[Jon Goodman]] and [[Colin Cooper]] to help his side progress.<ref>{{cite news |last=Haylett |first=Trevor |date=8 October 1992 |title=Football / Coca-Cola Cup: Seaman shines in shoot-out to deny Millwall: Winterburn hurt by coin thrower |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-coca-cola-cup-seaman-shines-in-shoot-out-to-deny-millwall-winterburn-hurt-by-coin-thrower-1556223.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=20 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, George Graham was sacked, and Arsenal came close to becoming the first club to retain the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], with Seaman earning a reputation as a [[penalty kick (football)|penalty]]-saving specialist after saving from [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]], [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]] and [[Attilio Lombardo]] in Arsenal's semi-final [[Penalty shootout|shoot-out]] against [[U.C.

Wenger rated Seaman highly and in [[1997-98 Arsenal F.C. season|1998]], Seaman helped the team to the [[1997-98 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and [[1997-98 FA Cup|FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]]. In [[1998-99 Arsenal F.C. season|1998\u201399]], Seaman played all 38 league matches, conceding only 17 league goals as Arsenal came within one point of retaining the [[1998\u201399 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and lost in the [[1998\u201399 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-finals to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. The following season Seaman managed to reach the [[2000 UEFA Cup Final]], which Arsenal drew 0\u20130 with [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], but lost on penalties.\n\nIn [[2001\u201302 Arsenal F.C. season|2002]], Seaman won the [[2001\u201302 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and the [[2001\u201302 FA Cup|FA Cup]] again to complete his second career double, although Arsenal's other goalkeepers [[Stuart Taylor (footballer born 1980)|Stuart Taylor]] (10 appearances) and [[Richard Wright (footballer)|Richard Wright]] (12 appearances) also won championship medals, due mainly to Seaman's absence through injuries. A highlight of this season was when Seaman dramatically saved a [[Gareth Barry]] penalty as Arsenal won 2\u20131 at [[Aston Villa]].<ref>{{cite news \n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1873883.stm\n|title=Arsenal see off Villa\n|publisher=BBC   \n|date=17 March 2002 |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite his international career ending so flatly and accusations his mobility had faded with age, the [[2002\u201303 Arsenal F.C. season|2002\u201303 season]]\u2014Seaman's last at Arsenal\u2014ended on a high note.

However, the goalkeeper leapt sideways and backwards, managing to stretch his right arm behind him and scoop the ball back and away from both his goal and the opposing players ready to pounce on a rebound. The match was Seaman's 1,000th professional career game. Seaman went on to [[Captain (association football)|captain]] the team during the [[2003 FA Cup Final]] in the absence of injured [[Patrick Vieira]] and keep another clean sheet at the [[Millennium Stadium]] as they defeated [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] 1\u20130. His final act with Arsenal was to lift the FA Cup, which was his eighth major trophy with his team. Seaman played in goal for Arsenal more times than anyone else, and is second after [[Ray Parlour]] in the all-time [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] appearances chart for Arsenal, with 325 to his name. In June 2008 he was voted seventh in the list of 50 Gunners' Greatest Players.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-7.-david-seaman |title=Gunners' Greatest Players \u2013 7.

Whilst out of action due to injury, Seaman announced his immediate retirement in January 2004 at the age of 40. His last act at City was to help Keegan select his successor in goal, [[David James (footballer)|David James]] \u2014 the man who had ousted him as England's first choice goalkeeper a little over a year earlier.\n\nIn November 2005, [[Paul Merson]] and [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] approached Seaman, and later ex-[[Wales national football team|Wales]] goalkeeper [[Neville Southall]] and [[Chris Woods]], to play in an [[FA Cup]] game at [[Merthyr Tydfil F.C.|Merthyr Tydfil]] as their two first-choice keepers, [[Joe Murphy (footballer born 1981)|Joe Murphy]] and [[Andy Oakes (footballer)|Andy Oakes]], were unavailable. However, Seaman was forced to turn this offer down, as it would have constituted a breach in the terms of his retirement insurance pay-out for his recurring shoulder injury.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ley |first=John |date=3 November 2005 |title=Seaman bid falls flat |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2367636/Seaman-bid-falls-flat.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nSeaman made his England debut in 1988 and appeared for the side in fifteen consecutive years, a national record, since equalled by [[Rio Ferdinand]].\n\nHe earned his first England cap under [[Bobby Robson]] in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in November 1988. Robson selected him as England's third-choice goalkeeper behind [[Peter Shilton]] and [[Chris Woods]] at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], but after arriving in Italy he had to pull out of the squad due to injury and was replaced by [[Dave Beasant]].\n\nSeaman remained a member of the England squad under new manager [[Graham Taylor]], although he was not selected for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 92]].

Seaman saved two spot-kicks in the tournament; the first a penalty in normal play from [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]'s [[Gary McAllister]] in a group match, while England were 1\u20130 up ([[Paul Gascoigne]] scored soon after to make it 2\u20130). Then, after England's quarter-final against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] ended scoreless, Seaman saved [[Miguel Angel Nadal]]'s kick in the shootout to knock Spain out of the tournament.

England went out on penalties, losing against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. [[Kevin Keegan]] selected him for [[UEFA Euro 2000]], where he started against both [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]] but sustained an injury in his warm-up exercises for the third game against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and was replaced by [[Nigel Martyn]].

He also became the [[spokesman]] for [[Yorkshire Tea]] during the early 1990s. He briefly replaced [[Gary Lineker]] as team captain on the television quiz ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]'' before producers decided to drop him in favour of former Arsenal teammate [[Ian Wright]].\n\nIn December 2004, following his retirement from professional football, he became one of the celebrities to take part in ''Strictly Ice Dancing'', an ice dance version of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', in which celebrities are paired with professional dancers. He joined the show at late notice, replacing [[Paul Gascoigne]]. With just eight days to prepare for the show, broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 26 December, Seaman and his professional partner Zoia Birmingham managed to win the competition. The other competitors spent a month in training for the show.\n\nIn late 2005 he had his trademark [[ponytail]] cut off on live television for charity, which ended negotiatory talks with such companies as L'Oreal who wanted to sponsor his hair as they had with [[David Ginola]]. He returned to the ice for another ice-dancing series, ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'', broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The series started on 14 January 2006, and Seaman ended in fourth place.

In a career lasting from 1981 to 2004, he is best known for his time playing for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He won 75 caps for the [[England national football team]], and is the country's second-most capped goalkeeper, after [[Peter Shilton]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamGkprs/GkprsMstApps.html |title=England's Goalkeepers in Most Appearance Order |work=England Football Online}}</ref> In 1997, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for services to football.\n\nThe peak of Seaman's career was during his period as Arsenal and England goalkeeper in the 1990s and early 2000s. During his time at Arsenal he won three league championships (1991, 1998, 2002), four [[FA Cup]]s (1993, 1998, 2002, 2003), the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1993 and the [[Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners Cup]] in 1994. During this time he also played for England in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]s, and [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]]. As well as Arsenal, he also played in the [[Premier League]] for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], as well as making appearances in the [[Football League]] for [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], Birmingham City and Queens Park Rangers.\n\nHis save from [[Paul Peschisolido]] of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[2002\u201303 FA Cup]] was described as one of the best ever.

He retired in 2004 due to a recurring shoulder injury. In June 2012, he was appointed goalkeeping coach of [[Combined Counties League]] club [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nSeaman was born in [[Rotherham]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]<!-- not South Yorkshire, which didn't exist until 11 years after Seaman's birth -->. He attended [[Kimberworth Comprehensive School]].<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article130783.ece ]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref> He began his career at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], the club he supported as a boy. However (much to his disappointment), he was not wanted by then-manager [[Eddie Gray (footballer born 1948)|Eddie Gray]], who had been his favourite player. Seaman went to Division 4 club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] for a \u00a34,000 fee in August 1982, where he began to make a name for himself.\n\nJust over two years later, in October 1984, [[Football League Championship|Second Division]] [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] paid \u00a3100,000 for Seaman's services. They ended up winning [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] at the end of that season, but were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] again at the end of the following season. Seaman was not to follow them back to Division Two, however.\n\nIn August 1986, Seaman moved to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] for \u00a3225,000. Playing in a higher profile club on a plastic pitch, he earned his first England cap, which came under [[Bobby Robson]] in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in November 1988. Whilst at QPR, Seaman was coached by Arsenal double-winner (of 1971) [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]], who was to work with him for more than a decade.\n\n=== Arsenal ===\nIn 1990, long before the current [[transfer window]] system had come to English football, there was still a transfer deadline a few weeks before the end of the season. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], who had won the league in 1989, wanted to sign Seaman, but the deal involved Arsenal's keeper [[John Lukic]] heading the opposite way on loan. Lukic did not want to do this, and the deal broke down and remained unresolved when the deadline passed. As soon as the season ended and clubs were allowed to buy players again, Arsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] came back for Seaman, with \u00a31.3 million (at the time a British record for a goalkeeper)<ref>{{cite news |last=Rich |first=Tim |date=13 May 2003 |title=Seaman's standing unfairly undermined by rare mistakes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/seamans-standing-unfairly-undermined-by-rare-mistakes-590470.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> being the agreed fee. Lukic, who was highly popular amongst Arsenal fans, left to rejoin Leeds.\n\nSeaman's time at Arsenal coincided with one of the most successful periods in the club's history. The [[1990\u201391 Arsenal F.C. season|1990\u201391 season]] saw Seaman concede only 18 goals when playing in every match of the 38-game season as Arsenal regained the [[List of English football champions|league title]].\n\nArsenal won both the [[1992\u201393 FA Cup|FA Cup]] and the [[1992\u201393 Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1993 and supplemented this a year later with the [[1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]].

Wenger rated Seaman highly and in [[1997-98 Arsenal F.C. season|1998]], Seaman helped the team to the [[1997-98 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and [[1997-98 FA Cup|FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]]. In [[1998-99 Arsenal F.C. season|1998\u201399]], Seaman played all 38 league matches, conceding only 17 league goals as Arsenal came within one point of retaining the [[1998\u201399 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and lost in the [[1998\u201399 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-finals to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. The following season Seaman managed to reach the [[2000 UEFA Cup Final]], which Arsenal drew 0\u20130 with [[Galatasaray S.K.

A highlight of this season was when Seaman dramatically saved a [[Gareth Barry]] penalty as Arsenal won 2\u20131 at [[Aston Villa]].<ref>{{cite news \n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1873883.stm\n|title=Arsenal see off Villa\n|publisher=BBC   \n|date=17 March 2002 |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite his international career ending so flatly and accusations his mobility had faded with age, the [[2002\u201303 Arsenal F.C. season|2002\u201303 season]]\u2014Seaman's last at Arsenal\u2014ended on a high note.

However, the goalkeeper leapt sideways and backwards, managing to stretch his right arm behind him and scoop the ball back and away from both his goal and the opposing players ready to pounce on a rebound. The match was Seaman's 1,000th professional career game.

Whilst out of action due to injury, Seaman announced his immediate retirement in January 2004 at the age of 40. His last act at City was to help Keegan select his successor in goal, [[David James (footballer)|David James]] \u2014 the man who had ousted him as England's first choice goalkeeper a little over a year earlier.\n\nIn November 2005, [[Paul Merson]] and [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] approached Seaman, and later ex-[[Wales national football team|Wales]] goalkeeper [[Neville Southall]] and [[Chris Woods]], to play in an [[FA Cup]] game at [[Merthyr Tydfil F.C.|Merthyr Tydfil]] as their two first-choice keepers, [[Joe Murphy (footballer born 1981)|Joe Murphy]] and [[Andy Oakes (footballer)|Andy Oakes]], were unavailable.

He also became the [[spokesman]] for [[Yorkshire Tea]] during the early 1990s. He briefly replaced [[Gary Lineker]] as team captain on the television quiz ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]'' before producers decided to drop him in favour of former Arsenal teammate [[Ian Wright]].\n\nIn December 2004, following his retirement from professional football, he became one of the celebrities to take part in ''Strictly Ice Dancing'', an ice dance version of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', in which celebrities are paired with professional dancers. He joined the show at late notice, replacing [[Paul Gascoigne]]. With just eight days to prepare for the show, broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 26 December, Seaman and his professional partner Zoia Birmingham managed to win the competition. The other competitors spent a month in training for the show.\n\nIn late 2005 he had his trademark [[ponytail]] cut off on live television for charity, which ended negotiatory talks with such companies as L'Oreal who wanted to sponsor his hair as they had with [[David Ginola]]. He returned to the ice for another ice-dancing series, ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'', broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The series started on 14 January 2006, and Seaman ended in fourth place. He has also appeared on ''All Star [[Family Fortunes]]''.\n\nSeaman also hosts a \"Safe Hands\" charity golf event annually, and has released two football-themed [[DVD]]s entitled ''David Seaman's Goalkeeping Nightmares'' in 2003 and ''Jeepers Keepers'' in 2004.
