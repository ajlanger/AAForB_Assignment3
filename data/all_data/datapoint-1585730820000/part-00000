Kier was listed as a public company on the [[London Stock Exchange]] from 1963 until it was acquired by [[Beazer]] in 1986. After a period under the ownership of [[Hanson plc]], it was bought out by its management in 1992, expanded its housing interests, and was relisted on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. During the early 21st century, it expanded through acquisitions, and in September 2018 Kier was ranked, by turnover, as the second biggest UK construction contractor, behind [[Balfour Beatty]].<ref name=\"Menary-22Sep2018\">{{cite news |last1=Menary |first1=Steve |title=TCI Top 100 Construction Companies 2018 |url=https://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/tci-top-100-construction-companies-2018 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=The Construction Index |date=22 September 2018}}</ref> It was a constituent of the [[FTSE 250 Index]] until its share price plunged following a failed [[rights issue]] in late 2018,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/24/kier-rights-issue-fails-to-attract-investors/|title=Kier rights issue fails to attract investors|date=24 December 2018|publisher=Investors Chronicle|accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> after which it started a restructuring, cost-cutting and disposals programme.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nThe company was founded by Jorgen Lotz and [[Olaf Kier]], [[Denmark|Danish]] engineers, under the name '''Lotz & Kier''' in 1928, and it was based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ACoL299r2EC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=Jorgen+Lotz+and+Olaf+Kier&source=bl&ots=aqZCZjIMae&sig=WyeIWRhMlQTXz04mxu70VqZob8A&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result |title=Ove Arup, Masterbuilder of the 20th Century by Peter Jones, Page 54|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nA few years later Lotz withdrew from the company, but Olaf Kier retained a semblance of his identity by including Lotz's initials in the organisation's new name, '''J.L.

Kier and Co|publisher=Grace's Guide|accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-World War II===\nBy the late 1930s Kier had moved its head office to [[Belgravia]] in [[Westminster]], and thereby became neighbours to many of Britain's leading construction engineering consultants and contractors, who had formed a substantial coterie in Westminster for professionals and businessmen engaged in civil engineering. Immediate neighbours included Marples Ridgeway (builders of [[Hammersmith Flyover]]) and [[Edmund Nuttall]] (builders of both [[Mersey Tunnels|Mersey road tunnels]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123014743/http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/views/obituaries/2007/08/09/sir-nicholas-nuttall-64375-19597612/|title=Obituary: Sir Nicholas Nuttall|date=9 August 2007|newspaper=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Concrete engineering====\nDuring its first 35 years, Kier became identified with certain civil engineering specialisms, such as contiguous cylindrical reinforced concrete grain silos and cement silos, using continuously sliding formwork; commencing with those at Barking in 1929, followed by grain silos at Northampton, Peterborough, Melksham, Gloucester and Witham; and cement silos at Norwich, Cambridge, Trinidad, and in India.<ref>pps 28 & 29, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref>\n\nSuch specialist work was part of a pattern that quickly developed in the company's operations during that period, namely the undertaking of innovative, state-of-the-art civil engineering techniques at the forefront of modern technology. Other elements within this pattern were hyperbolic natural draft cooling towers (mostly around 300&nbsp;ft high),<ref>pps 17-19, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref> monolithic concrete chimneys (sometimes over 400&nbsp;ft high),<ref>p 16, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref> complete power station structures,<ref>pps 11-14, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref> and coastal works such as tanker berths, docks and harbours.<ref>pps 3-7, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref>\n[[Image:Highpoint detail.jpg|right|thumb|Corner detail of [[Highpoint I]], showing balcony profiles.]]\nIn the same period, only this time in the building sector, Kier were in the vanguard of new reinforced concrete systems for use as framework for tall buildings.  Their most famous contribution in this field was an eight-storey ''avant-garde'' development of apartment blocks named [[Highpoint I|Highpoint]], located in [[Highgate|Highgate Village]], north London. They were responsible for the reinforced concrete and general building.<ref>pps 44 & 45, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref>\n\nWhen this project was completed in 1935 it became widely renowned as the finest example of this form of construction for residential purposes.

However, his son by his first marriage was killed in a riding accident in 1945. Then, during the 1950s, Olaf's nephew, Mogens Kier, joined the firm's management structure, but did not progress to a leading position in the company. Olaf died in an accident in 1986, aged 87; and Mogens died in 2003.<ref>[http://www.kier.co.uk/uploaded/fellowlinks/KierLink%20Newsletter%20Issue%207.pdf Kierlink] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722142519/http://www.kier.co.uk/uploaded/fellowlinks/KierLink%20Newsletter%20Issue%207.pdf |date=22 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Post-World War II===\nJ.L. Kier & Co Ltd remained a private company until 1963 when it obtained a listing on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and became a public company.  Its offer for shares was many times oversubscribed. The Kier family retained a significant majority of the holding. In 1973 Kier merged with [[W. & C. French]] to form '''French Kier''' but within the French division there were heavy losses on fixed-price motorway contracts and land development.  A long-serving Kier engineer, John Mott, was appointed chief executive in order to revive the group's fortunes. Following an abortive bid for Abbey in 1985, French Kier itself was the subject of a hotly contested bid by [[Beazer]], which eventually succeeded in January 1986.<ref name=\"Dictionary\">Wellings, Fred: ''Dictionary of British Housebuilders'' (2006) Troubador. {{ISBN|978-0-9552965-0-5}}</ref>\n\nFive years later (1991) [[Hanson plc]] bought Beazer plc<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D71E3DF934A2575AC0A967958260 |title=COMPANY NEWS; Hanson to Buy Beazer In $609 Million Deal |author=Jonathan P.

Kier was listed as a public company on the [[London Stock Exchange]] from 1963 until it was acquired by [[Beazer]] in 1986. After a period under the ownership of [[Hanson plc]], it was bought out by its management in 1992, expanded its housing interests, and was relisted on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. During the early 21st century, it expanded through acquisitions, and in September 2018 Kier was ranked, by turnover, as the second biggest UK construction contractor, behind [[Balfour Beatty]].<ref name=\"Menary-22Sep2018\">{{cite news |last1=Menary |first1=Steve |title=TCI Top 100 Construction Companies 2018 |url=https://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/tci-top-100-construction-companies-2018 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=The Construction Index |date=22 September 2018}}</ref> It was a constituent of the [[FTSE 250 Index]] until its share price plunged following a failed [[rights issue]] in late 2018,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/24/kier-rights-issue-fails-to-attract-investors/|title=Kier rights issue fails to attract investors|date=24 December 2018|publisher=Investors Chronicle|accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> after which it started a restructuring, cost-cutting and disposals programme.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nThe company was founded by Jorgen Lotz and [[Olaf Kier]], [[Denmark|Danish]] engineers, under the name '''Lotz & Kier''' in 1928, and it was based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ACoL299r2EC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=Jorgen+Lotz+and+Olaf+Kier&source=bl&ots=aqZCZjIMae&sig=WyeIWRhMlQTXz04mxu70VqZob8A&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result |title=Ove Arup, Masterbuilder of the 20th Century by Peter Jones, Page 54|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nA few years later Lotz withdrew from the company, but Olaf Kier retained a semblance of his identity by including Lotz's initials in the organisation's new name, '''J.L.

Immediate neighbours included Marples Ridgeway (builders of [[Hammersmith Flyover]]) and [[Edmund Nuttall]] (builders of both [[Mersey Tunnels|Mersey road tunnels]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123014743/http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/views/obituaries/2007/08/09/sir-nicholas-nuttall-64375-19597612/|title=Obituary: Sir Nicholas Nuttall|date=9 August 2007|newspaper=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Concrete engineering====\nDuring its first 35 years, Kier became identified with certain civil engineering specialisms, such as contiguous cylindrical reinforced concrete grain silos and cement silos, using continuously sliding formwork; commencing with those at Barking in 1929, followed by grain silos at Northampton, Peterborough, Melksham, Gloucester and Witham; and cement silos at Norwich, Cambridge, Trinidad, and in India.<ref>pps 28 & 29, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref>\n\nSuch specialist work was part of a pattern that quickly developed in the company's operations during that period, namely the undertaking of innovative, state-of-the-art civil engineering techniques at the forefront of modern technology. Other elements within this pattern were hyperbolic natural draft cooling towers (mostly around 300&nbsp;ft high),<ref>pps 17-19, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref> monolithic concrete chimneys (sometimes over 400&nbsp;ft high),<ref>p 16, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref> complete power station structures,<ref>pps 11-14, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref> and coastal works such as tanker berths, docks and harbours.<ref>pps 3-7, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref>\n[[Image:Highpoint detail.jpg|right|thumb|Corner detail of [[Highpoint I]], showing balcony profiles.]]\nIn the same period, only this time in the building sector, Kier were in the vanguard of new reinforced concrete systems for use as framework for tall buildings.  Their most famous contribution in this field was an eight-storey ''avant-garde'' development of apartment blocks named [[Highpoint I|Highpoint]], located in [[Highgate|Highgate Village]], north London. They were responsible for the reinforced concrete and general building.<ref>pps 44 & 45, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn</ref>\n\nWhen this project was completed in 1935 it became widely renowned as the finest example of this form of construction for residential purposes.

However, his son by his first marriage was killed in a riding accident in 1945. Then, during the 1950s, Olaf's nephew, Mogens Kier, joined the firm's management structure, but did not progress to a leading position in the company.

Kier & Co Ltd remained a private company until 1963 when it obtained a listing on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and became a public company.  Its offer for shares was many times oversubscribed. The Kier family retained a significant majority of the holding. In 1973 Kier merged with [[W. & C. French]] to form '''French Kier''' but within the French division there were heavy losses on fixed-price motorway contracts and land development.  A long-serving Kier engineer, John Mott, was appointed chief executive in order to revive the group's fortunes. Following an abortive bid for Abbey in 1985, French Kier itself was the subject of a hotly contested bid by [[Beazer]], which eventually succeeded in January 1986.<ref name=\"Dictionary\">Wellings, Fred: ''Dictionary of British Housebuilders'' (2006) Troubador. {{ISBN|978-0-9552965-0-5}}</ref>\n\nFive years later (1991) [[Hanson plc]] bought Beazer plc<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D71E3DF934A2575AC0A967958260 |title=COMPANY NEWS; Hanson to Buy Beazer In $609 Million Deal |author=Jonathan P.
