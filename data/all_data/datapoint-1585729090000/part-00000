This was the same [[Triumph Slant-4 engine]] used in the [[Triumph Dolomite]], but the Saab version was fitted with a [[Zenith Carburettor Company (British)|Zenith-Stromberg]] CD [[carburetor]] developed specially for Saab. A number of Saab 99s were equipped with a [[Triumph Stag]] [[Triumph V8|V8]], but the V8 was later dropped in favour of a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] unit which later powered the 99 Turbo.\n\nA three-door estate version was planned from the start, but never made it into production.<ref>[http://www.saabsportclub.com/site/ssc_musee/auto/images/saab_99_proto_20.jpg saabsportclub.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.saabsportclub.com/site/ssc_musee/auto/images/saab_99_proto_17.jpg saabsportclub.com]</ref> In 1971 (with thoughts about a [[combi coup\u00e9]]) the work on an estate was restarted, this time as a five-door.<ref>[http://www.saabsportclub.com/site/ssc_musee/auto/images/saab_99_proto_break_1971.jpg saabsportclub.com]</ref>\n\n== Description and reception ==\nThe first engine used in the original 99 was a [[Straight engine|four-cylinder in-line engine]] which was tilted at 45 degrees.

During the lifetime of the 99 model, several subsequent engine developments took place, including the incorporation of [[fuel injection]] for some versions.<ref name=Autocar1976/>\n\nThe 99 was 'front-wheel-drive', its engine being unconventionally fitted 'back to front', with the clutch at the front. Drive to the under-mounted gearbox was by triplex chain. Front-wheel-drive was still a relatively uncommon configuration at the time of the 99's introduction, although earlier Saabs had also featured it.\n\nThe [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] (hood) was front-hinged and the panel extended over the front wheel-arches. The [[windscreen]] (windshield) was 'wrap-around' and very deep for the era. The [[A-pillar]] had a steep angle, providing excellent [[driver visibility]]. In 1968, the English test-driver Archie Vicar wrote in ''Mass Motorist'' magazine: \"The little 99 has been given a striking and wholly rational appearance. It gives the flavour of an aeroplane on four wheels.\"<ref name=\"carmagazine.co.uk\">\"Mass Motorist\" Dec 1968 [http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Community/Forum-Landing/Forum-Categories/Topic/?&topic-id=7297 carmagazine.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720111512/http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Community/Forum-Landing/Forum-Categories/Topic/?&topic-id=7297 |date=2011-07-20 }}</ref> The [[drag coefficient|Cw value]] was 0.37 while other cars of the time had 0.4 to 0.5. The chassis was also designed for passive safety, with deformation zones front and rear.<ref name=\"TV8744\"/>\n\nDue to the American [[sealed beam]] [[headlamp]] requirement in place at the time, the USA models had a special front fascia with four round headlights instead of the two rectangular units it had in other markets. The \"US front\" then became an item for [[Custom car|car customisers]] in Europe, and ''[[vice versa]]''.\n\nEarly 99s carried over the [[freewheel]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] from the Saab 96, but the freewheel was removed with the introduction of the 1.85&nbsp;L engine,<ref name=\"TV8745\">[[#CC87|Carlquist]], p. 45</ref> likely on account of the extra power that the apparatus would have to transmit.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The [[handbrake]] was on the front wheels.\n\nThe 99 was Saab's last factory rally car,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} first in '''EMS''' guise and later as the '''Turbo''' version. The Saab 99 Turbo was one of the first 'family cars' to be fitted with a turbo after the 1962-63 [[Oldsmobile]] Turbo Jetfire; other contemporary turbocharged automobiles were 'specialised' vehicles and were difficult to drive. ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' lists the Saab 99 Turbo as number two on its Top Ten list of turbocharged cars of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/news/vintage-speed/4296068 |title=Top 10 Turbocharged Cars of All Time |publisher=Popularmechanics.com |date=2008-12-17 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1982 Saab 99 4-dr.jpg|thumb|Late (1982) SAAB 99 four-door sedan]]\nThe UK's ''\"[http://driventowrite.com/2014/11/07/1968-saab-99-review/ Mass Motorist]\"'' magazine (1968) summarised their view of the 99 as follows: \"That the 99 is comfortable, well-made, satisfying to drive and well-equipped ought to mean that other makers should take heed. The [[BMW 02 Series|BMW 2002]] and [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]] are the SAAB 99's main rivals. I would contend here that SAAB has the advantage of them, and should SAAB choose to fit an even more powerful motor, the 99 could be a class leader in a short space of time.\"<ref name=\"carmagazine.co.uk\"/>\n\n[[Wheels magazine]] wrote in a July 1978 road test of the 99 Turbo, \"Compare the top-gear times and you'll see that the Turbo is almost as fast between {{convert|60|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|160|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in fourth gear as any five-seater in the world\".

The hood/bonnet of the 99 (and also the 900) caused problems for the police livery team. Since it wraps around, covering the wheel arches, the paint had to be extended up onto the hood panel and not restricted to just the fenders as on other cars.\n\nThe Saab 99 ([[sedan (car)|saloon]] model) featured a heating duct leading to the rear window - a lever between the front seats controlled the de-fogging airflow. The 99 featured a floor-located ignition switch which also locked the gear stick (rather than the steering wheel). This arrangement required drivers to select reverse gear before the ignition key could be removed.\n\nIn 2012, a roadworthy 99 Turbo was filmed on-the-road, in a feature on Saab's car manufacturing history, on the British ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' television show. [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and his co-presenters reviewed the company's history and shared their own experiences with Saab models, arguing that Saab Automobile (Saab's car manufacturing subsidiary, which by then was in bankruptcy) had always striven for safety and innovative features.<ref>{{Cite episode\n | title = Top Gear\n | network = BBC\n | date =29 January 2012\n | season =18\n | series =5\n}}</ref>\n\n== Models ==\n[[File:Saab 99 EMS 1974 (UK Spec).jpg|thumb|UK-spec 1974 Saab 99 EMS]]\n*'''E '''\u2014Introduced for 1970 (available by order, not from the dealer floor), the 99E (Electronic [[fuel injection]], four-speed manual) was originally only available in a two-door version.

Engine was equipped from 1972 to 1974 with Bosch D-jetronic and from 1975 on with Bosch K-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection. Despite the fuel system change, letter \"e\" was kept in model name. In 1977 the EMS became available in the three-door 'wagonback' body that was introduced for standard models in 1974 (1978 in the USA). It had a stiffer suspension and was sold in yellow or a copper coral [[metallic paint]] in '73, Sterling Silver or Sunset orange in '74, black or Sterling silver in '75 and '76, black, Sterling silver, or Cardinal red in 1977, and Sterling silver or Cardinal red in '78.

The body was originally a 3-door ''[[combi coup\u00e9]]'' version but later in 1979-80 the company produced a two-door model, which was a limited homologation exercise to enable the production of a rally car. It was available in Cardinal red, Sterling silver, Anthracite grey, and Black; the two-door was available in silver, cardinal red and metallic green. The '''Turbo S''' was a special model with factory-mounted [[water injection (engines)|water injection]], giving an extra 15\u201320&nbsp;PS.

In 1970 the interior was also given a facelift and became more luxurious, with a new steering wheel. The exhaust system was now made of aluminum, engine mounts and drive joints were changed. In March, the 99E (also available with a three-speed automatic transmission) was introduced. It had a 1.75&nbsp;L engine with electronically controlled fuel injection, giving {{convert|87|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"TV8745\"/>\n\nIn 1971 the 99 was given a larger and stronger engine, a 1.85&nbsp;L engine giving {{convert|86|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on the [[carbureted]] model and {{convert|95|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for the fuel-injected model. The 1.75&nbsp;L engine was now only available with a carburetor. Saab also introduced headlight wipers, as well as larger rear-view mirrors and an additional air inlet beneath the existing grille. The dashboard was given a redesign along with new instruments.<ref name=\"TV8745\"/>\n\nIn 1972 the 1.75&nbsp;L engine was no longer available. The power of the engine was increased to {{convert|88|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for carbureted models and {{convert|97|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for fuel-injected models. The [[Saab B engine|2.0&nbsp;L engine]] became available. The major change this year were new plastic bumpers that could take impacts up to {{convert|8|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and still retain their shape. The suspension was stiffened and received stronger dampers. An electrically heated driver's seat was also introduced. In January 1972 the 99 '''EMS''' (''Electronic-Manual-Special'') was introduced. It was a sportier model that was originally only available in a two-door version; but became available in the wagonback body beginning in 1974 (Europe). It had stiffer suspension and also silver or copper ('bronze')-colored metallic paint as option. The engine had 1985&nbsp;cc [[engine displacement|displacement]] and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Jetronic#D-Jetronic (1967\u20131976)|D-Jetronic]] electronic fuel injection giving {{convert|110|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|170|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nFor the United States, a special 99 SSE was developed to satisfy demand while the EMS was not yet available there. The SSE had a black or burled walnut [[vinyl roof]] cover and an [[automatic transmission]] (by [[Borg-Warner]]). It also had the 1.85&nbsp;L Triumph engine installed.\n\nIn 1973 a low-cost model called the 99L was introduced. It was a two-door with a 1.85&nbsp;L engine giving {{convert|88|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. All other models had the Swedish-built 2.0&nbsp;L engine, which produces {{convert|95|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} in carburetted form. The LE model had electronic fuel injection giving {{convert|110|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The LE model was mainly made for export. The inner ceiling was changed, as were protective bars in the doors, and a new black grille. In Northern Europe, a de-contented model called the 99 X7 was also marketed.<ref name=\"TV8745\"/>\n\nIn January 1974 the three-door [[hatchback]] ''[[Combi-coup\u00e9]]'' (marketed as a \"Wagon Back\" in the USA) was introduced. It was {{convert|11|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer than the [[sedan (car)|sedan]]. Front seats and steering wheel were new for 1974, while the EMS received an all-new, model-specific interior. [[Seat belt|Inertial reel belts]] were also fitted.\n\nIn 1975 the brakes were improved and the [[hand brake]] now worked directly on the primary brake pads instead of on separate pads acting as drum brakes inside the brake rotor. The 99 was now available in two versions, one with a carburetor with {{convert|100|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and a fuel-injected version using Bosch [[Jetronic#K-Jetronic (1974\u20131988)|K-Jetronic]] fuel injection system giving {{convert|118|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. In February a model using Zenith-Stromberg 150CDS(E) dual carburetors was introduced. It was only available for the Combi-coup\u00e9 and has {{convert|108|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The Combi-coup\u00e9 had been fitted with a unique grille in 1974; this was now applied across the range.<ref name=\"TV8745\"/>\n\nIn 1976 nothing major was changed, but a self-adjusting [[clutch]] was introduced. The engines were adapted for tougher emissions requirements and several models with an electrically heated rear window were introduced. A luxurious 4-door sedan model was available, the 99 GLE. it came with power steering, an automatic transmission, a fuel-injected engine, luxurious upholstery on the seats and an armrest in the rear seat. The five-door Combi-coup\u00e9 model was also introduced.<ref name=\"TV8745\"/>\n\nIn 1977, the front light clusters and the sedan's tail lights were enlarged. The rubber strips on the bumpers were changed. The \"One Hundred series\" of test-fleet Turbo cars were distributed around the world. The cars were mainly made from three- and two-door EMS models, but a few four-door and even five-door cars were also made. The four- and five-door models were tested by mostly police in Sweden, Finland and Switzerland.\n\nIn 1978 a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] version of the car, the 99 Turbo, was introduced. It was only available as a Combi-coup\u00e9 until the next year. The turbocharged two-liter engine produced {{convert|145|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} giving the car a top speed of {{convert|200|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.

A number of Saab 99s were equipped with a [[Triumph Stag]] [[Triumph V8|V8]], but the V8 was later dropped in favour of a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] unit which later powered the 99 Turbo.\n\nA three-door estate version was planned from the start, but never made it into production.<ref>[http://www.saabsportclub.com/site/ssc_musee/auto/images/saab_99_proto_20.jpg saabsportclub.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.saabsportclub.com/site/ssc_musee/auto/images/saab_99_proto_17.jpg saabsportclub.com]</ref> In 1971 (with thoughts about a [[combi coup\u00e9]]) the work on an estate was restarted, this time as a five-door.<ref>[http://www.saabsportclub.com/site/ssc_musee/auto/images/saab_99_proto_break_1971.jpg saabsportclub.com]</ref>\n\n== Description and reception ==\nThe first engine used in the original 99 was a [[Straight engine|four-cylinder in-line engine]] which was tilted at 45 degrees.

During the lifetime of the 99 model, several subsequent engine developments took place, including the incorporation of [[fuel injection]] for some versions.<ref name=Autocar1976/>\n\nThe 99 was 'front-wheel-drive', its engine being unconventionally fitted 'back to front', with the clutch at the front. Drive to the under-mounted gearbox was by triplex chain. Front-wheel-drive was still a relatively uncommon configuration at the time of the 99's introduction, although earlier Saabs had also featured it.\n\nThe [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] (hood) was front-hinged and the panel extended over the front wheel-arches. The [[windscreen]] (windshield) was 'wrap-around' and very deep for the era. The [[A-pillar]] had a steep angle, providing excellent [[driver visibility]]. In 1968, the English test-driver Archie Vicar wrote in ''Mass Motorist'' magazine: \"The little 99 has been given a striking and wholly rational appearance. It gives the flavour of an aeroplane on four wheels.\"<ref name=\"carmagazine.co.uk\">\"Mass Motorist\" Dec 1968 [http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Community/Forum-Landing/Forum-Categories/Topic/?&topic-id=7297 carmagazine.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720111512/http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Community/Forum-Landing/Forum-Categories/Topic/?&topic-id=7297 |date=2011-07-20 }}</ref> The [[drag coefficient|Cw value]] was 0.37 while other cars of the time had 0.4 to 0.5. The chassis was also designed for passive safety, with deformation zones front and rear.<ref name=\"TV8744\"/>\n\nDue to the American [[sealed beam]] [[headlamp]] requirement in place at the time, the USA models had a special front fascia with four round headlights instead of the two rectangular units it had in other markets. The \"US front\" then became an item for [[Custom car|car customisers]] in Europe, and ''[[vice versa]]''.\n\nEarly 99s carried over the [[freewheel]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] from the Saab 96, but the freewheel was removed with the introduction of the 1.85&nbsp;L engine,<ref name=\"TV8745\">[[#CC87|Carlquist]], p. 45</ref> likely on account of the extra power that the apparatus would have to transmit.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The [[handbrake]] was on the front wheels.\n\nThe 99 was Saab's last factory rally car,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} first in '''EMS''' guise and later as the '''Turbo''' version. The Saab 99 Turbo was one of the first 'family cars' to be fitted with a turbo after the 1962-63 [[Oldsmobile]] Turbo Jetfire; other contemporary turbocharged automobiles were 'specialised' vehicles and were difficult to drive.

The [[BMW 02 Series|BMW 2002]] and [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]] are the SAAB 99's main rivals. I would contend here that SAAB has the advantage of them, and should SAAB choose to fit an even more powerful motor, the 99 could be a class leader in a short space of time.\"<ref name=\"carmagazine.co.uk\"/>\n\n[[Wheels magazine]] wrote in a July 1978 road test of the 99 Turbo, \"Compare the top-gear times and you'll see that the Turbo is almost as fast between {{convert|60|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|160|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in fourth gear as any five-seater in the world\".

The hood/bonnet of the 99 (and also the 900) caused problems for the police livery team. Since it wraps around, covering the wheel arches, the paint had to be extended up onto the hood panel and not restricted to just the fenders as on other cars.\n\nThe Saab 99 ([[sedan (car)|saloon]] model) featured a heating duct leading to the rear window - a lever between the front seats controlled the de-fogging airflow. The 99 featured a floor-located ignition switch which also locked the gear stick (rather than the steering wheel). This arrangement required drivers to select reverse gear before the ignition key could be removed.\n\nIn 2012, a roadworthy 99 Turbo was filmed on-the-road, in a feature on Saab's car manufacturing history, on the British ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' television show. [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and his co-presenters reviewed the company's history and shared their own experiences with Saab models, arguing that Saab Automobile (Saab's car manufacturing subsidiary, which by then was in bankruptcy) had always striven for safety and innovative features.<ref>{{Cite episode\n | title = Top Gear\n | network = BBC\n | date =29 January 2012\n | season =18\n | series =5\n}}</ref>\n\n== Models ==\n[[File:Saab 99 EMS 1974 (UK Spec).jpg|thumb|UK-spec 1974 Saab 99 EMS]]\n*'''E '''\u2014Introduced for 1970 (available by order, not from the dealer floor), the 99E (Electronic [fuel injection], four-speed manual) was originally only available in a two-door version.

The 1.75&nbsp;L engine was now only available with a carburetor. Saab also introduced headlight wipers, as well as larger rear-view mirrors and an additional air inlet beneath the existing grille. The dashboard was given a redesign along with new instruments.<ref name=\"TV8745\"/>\n\nIn 1972 the 1.75&nbsp;L engine was no longer available. The power of the engine was increased to {{convert|88|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for carbureted models and {{convert|97|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for fuel-injected models. The [[Saab B engine|2.0&nbsp;L engine]] became available. The major change this year were new plastic bumpers that could take impacts up to {{convert|8|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and still retain their shape. The suspension was stiffened and received stronger dampers. An electrically heated driver's seat was also introduced. In January 1972 the 99 '''EMS''' (''Electronic-Manual-Special'') was introduced. It was a sportier model that was originally only available in a two-door version; but became available in the wagonback body beginning in 1974 (Europe). It had stiffer suspension and also silver or copper ('bronze')-colored metallic paint as option. The engine had 1985&nbsp;cc [[engine displacement|displacement]] and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Jetronic#D-Jetronic (1967\u20131976)|D-Jetronic]] electronic fuel injection giving {{convert|110|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|170|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nFor the United States, a special 99 SSE was developed to satisfy demand while the EMS was not yet available there. The SSE had a black or burled walnut [[vinyl roof]] cover and an [[automatic transmission]] (by [[Borg-Warner]]). It also had the 1.85&nbsp;L Triumph engine installed.\n\nIn 1973 a low-cost model called the 99L was introduced. It was a two-door with a 1.85&nbsp;L engine giving {{convert|88|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. All other models had the Swedish-built 2.0&nbsp;L engine, which produces {{convert|95|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} in carburetted form. The LE model had electronic fuel injection giving {{convert|110|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The LE model was mainly made for export. The inner ceiling was changed, as were protective bars in the doors, and a new black grille. In Northern Europe, a de-contented model called the 99 X7 was also marketed.<ref name=\"TV8745\"/>\n\nIn January 1974 the three-door [[hatchback]] ''[[Combi-coup\u00e9]]'' (marketed as a \"Wagon Back\" in the USA) was introduced. It was {{convert|11|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer than the [[sedan (car)|sedan]]. Front seats and steering wheel were new for 1974, while the EMS received an all-new, model-specific interior. [[Seat belt|Inertial reel belts]] were also fitted.\n\nIn 1975 the brakes were improved and the [[hand brake]] now worked directly on the primary brake pads instead of on separate pads acting as drum brakes inside the brake rotor. The 99 was now available in two versions, one with a carburetor with {{convert|100|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and a fuel-injected version using Bosch [[Jetronic#K-Jetronic (1974\u20131988)|K-Jetronic]] fuel injection system giving {{convert|118|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. In February a model using Zenith-Stromberg 150CDS(E) dual carburetors was introduced. It was only available for the Combi-coup\u00e9 and has {{convert|108|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The Combi-coup\u00e9 had been fitted with a unique grille in 1974; this was now applied across the range.<ref name=\"TV8745\"/>\n\nIn 1976 nothing major was changed, but a self-adjusting [[clutch]] was introduced. The engines were adapted for tougher emissions requirements and several models with an electrically heated rear window were introduced. A luxurious 4-door sedan model was available, the 99 GLE. it came with power steering, an automatic transmission, a fuel-injected engine, luxurious upholstery on the seats and an armrest in the rear seat. The five-door Combi-coup\u00e9 model was also introduced.<ref name=\"TV8745\"/>\n\nIn 1977, the front light clusters and the sedan's tail lights were enlarged. The rubber strips on the bumpers were changed. The \"One Hundred series\" of test-fleet Turbo cars were distributed around the world. The cars were mainly made from three- and two-door EMS models, but a few four-door and even five-door cars were also made. The four- and five-door models were tested by mostly police in Sweden, Finland and Switzerland.\n\nIn 1978 a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] version of the car, the 99 Turbo, was introduced. It was only available as a Combi-coup\u00e9 until the next year. The turbocharged two-liter engine produced {{convert|145|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} giving the car a top speed of {{convert|200|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The turbochargers were designed and built by [[Garrett AiResearch]]. In terms of appearance, it received distinctive alloy wheels and front and rear spoilers.<ref name=\"AV24.6\">{{cite journal | journal = Autovisie | date = 1979-03-24 | volume = 24 | number = 6 | publisher = Arnold van der Wees | location = Amersfoort, Netherlands | language = Dutch | title = Rijden met Saab Turbo 2 | trans-title = A ride in the Saab Turbo 2 | last = van Keempen | first = Ric | page = 18 }}</ref> The 99 Turbo repositioned Saab in the car market and it came to be regarded as an iconic and technologically significant model of its era. By early 1979, over 10,000 turbo-engined Saabs had already been built, as Saab successfully entered a new market segment.<ref name=\"AV24.6\"/> Other news for 1978 included the availability of a sunroof, and the EMS became a three-door Combi-coup\u00e9 in some markets.\n\nIn 1979 the Combi-coup\u00e9 option was discontinued for the 99, as the new [[Saab 900]] was only available in this bodystyle. The 99 Turbo changed over to the two-door saloon bodywork although only a small number were built. The rear axle was altered, the fuel tank changed to a plastic one, new wheels were fitted, and four-door models received new bumpers similar to those of the 900. These bumpers were also installed on two-doors beginning with the 1980 model year.<ref name=\"AB80\">{{citation | title = Alla Bilar -80 | trans-title = All Cars 1980 | editor-last = Bj\u00f6rklund | editor-first = Stig | publisher = Specialtidningsf\u00f6rlaget AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | language = Swedish | isbn = 91-7274-093-0 | page = 103 }}</ref> In 1980 the 99 was also given the new and safer seats from the Saab 900, as well as low-mounted protective strips along the sides.<ref name=Keesings79>{{cite magazine | title = Nieuw 1980 |trans-title=1980 News |language=nl-be |magazine=Keesings Auto Magazine | location = Antwerp, Belgium | date = 1979-09-15 | volume = 2 | number = 17 | page = 6 | editor-last = Rombauts | editor-first = Walter }}</ref> The [[Spare tire|spare wheel]] was changed to an emergency unit. The carpeting, which had been changed to rubber a few years earlier, went back to textile. In the Swedish market the twin-carb version made a return for a single year, sold as the 99 Super and only available with four doors and an automatic transmission.<ref name=\"AB80\"/>\n\nIn 1981 the twin-carb Super was discontinued, although the 99 did gain a new engine option in its stead: the 99 GL with {{convert|100|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} was joined by the 99 GLi with {{convert|118|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, both with four-speed manual transmissions. The GLi was a bit more luxurious and had power side mirrors. It was only sold in Northern Europe and only around 1600 were built. All 99s received a new rear seat, velour upholstery, new rear mirrors, a new steering wheel, and the 900's front axle.<ref name=\"TV8745\"/>\n\nIn 1982 came the H engine, built by [[Scania AB|Scania]] at [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]], making it possible for all cars to run on [[octane rating|93 octane]] [[gasoline]]. The two- and four-door 99&nbsp;GLs were now available with a five-speed manual transmission. The window surround trim was blacked out and the wheels were new.\n\nIn 1983 a number of smaller technical and cosmetic changes were made, including a new grille similar to that of the 900 and blacked out B-pillars on two-door models.<ref name=TV188219>{{cite magazine | title = Tortyrbromsar | trans-title = Tortured brakes | ref = TVn18 | language = Swedish | magazine = [[Teknikens V\u00e4rld]] | publisher = Specialtidningsf\u00f6rlaget AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 19 | date = 1982-08-25 | issue = 18 | volume = 34 | first = Inge | last = Alnaeus }}</ref> Brake pads were now [[Asbestos|asbestos-free]]. Five-speed-equipped 99s received low-resistance tires, which sit on wider 5\u00bd-inch rims, requiring moving the rear axle.<ref name=TV188219/> Some further minor changes took place for 1984, including [[Ignition system|electronic ignition]], lowered seats, and a more upright steering wheel. Five-speed cars also received interval wipers. This was to be the final year for the 99. It was replaced by the [[Saab 90]] and the Saab 900.\n\nA total of 588,643 were made; this total rises to 614,003 if Saab 90 production is included.<ref name=\"TV8745\"/>\n\n== WRC victories ==\n\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; \"\n!
