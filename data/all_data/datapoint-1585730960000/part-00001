The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies.

The yellow-throated miner, [[black-eared miner]], and [[noisy miner]] are very similar in appearance and were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'' which is still sometimes listed as the subgenus for those species.

Wings are dark grey with varying levels of yellow highlighting. The ventral feathering is light grey to white with light grey scalloping on the chest. The feathering surrounding the eye is black. The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies. Fledgling birds have undefined, fluffy light grey chests without scalloping. Immature birds can be identified in the hand by retained juvenile remiges and rectrices, which are more brownish.<ref name=\"BirdInTheHand\" /> Yellow-throated miners are distinctive from the other miners by their clean white rump, instead of the continuous grey from the back that the noisy and black-eared miners have. The white-rump is clearly visible as yellow-throated miners are flying away, so this feature is often used in the field where two miner species overlap.  Yellow-throated miners have a varying amount of yellow highlighting above and below the beak on the forehead and chin, as well as on the sides of the throat. This differs from noisy miners which have white above the beak and no yellow highlighting on the  forehead or neck, but can have a small amount of yellow on the chin. Yellow-throated miners have paler feathering on the lower jaw compared to the throat, while pure black-eared miners have darker feathering on the lower jaw compared to that of the throat. Hybrids between the yellow-throated and black-eared miners have a range of rump and lower jaw shades.<ref name=\"BlackEaredMinerABSA\">{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=J.

''M. f. wayensis'' has the largest distribution across the middle of Western Australia through to [[Western Queensland]]. ''M. f. flavigula'' is the easternmost sub-species, and covers most of Queensland except [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] and the coast from [[South East Queensland]] south and extends south through [[New South Wales]] and inland [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. ''M. f. lutea'' extends across the northern parts of [[Western Australia]] and the Northern Territory. ''M. f. obscura'' occurs in [[Southwest, Western Australia|south-western]] Western Australia .

Calls are higher pitched than noisy miner calls, but are readily recognizable as a miner call.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> They are watchful and are often the first to alarm when a predator appears. As with the other miner species, they are known to be very aggressive to other birds, particularly smaller insectivores and honeyeaters.
