The Freedmen\u2019s Conventions took place in [[Augusta]], [[Georgia]]. This was after the [[Civil War]], [[emancipation]], and just one year after the assassination of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. President Lincoln is mentioned many times in these meetings as being a savior of the African American people in the United States.  Early prominent leaders of this organization include [[Captain J.E. Bryant]], who was named the first president, Captain C.H. Prince and Thomas P.

Some of these rules include the times the convention would meet, a required prayer before the proceedings of the convention, and the roles of the leaders of the organization, When it came to decorum during the meetings, the rules of the Convention were very similar to Robert\u2019s Rules of order.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robert|first=Henry|title=Robert's Rules of Order|publisher=Clydesdale|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Another aspect of the meeting was thanking President Lincoln for his sacrifice before and during the Civil War to help black people in the United States.\n\n== April 4, 1866 Meeting ==\nThe second convention took place on April 4, 1866 in the Office of the Loyal Georgian, a newspaper produced by the Georgia Equal Rights Association from 1866-1867.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/sn82016224/|title=The Loyal Georgian|last=|first=|date=1866-1867|website=Library of Congress|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> At this meeting, President J.E. Bryant urged his members to elect a black man to be sent to Congress as a representative of the black race in the United States. This was especially important since he also told the members to be law-abiding citizens, especially when it came to taxes. According to Bryant, the thousands of black, tax-paying, law abiding Americans deserved representation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://omeka.coloredconventions.org/items/show/1193|title=Proceedings of the Council of the Georgia Equal Rights Association.

The men who were in charge of the finances were also chosen during this time, Captain C.H. Prince and Thomas P. Beard, one black man and one white man. There was also a similar structure for the editors of the paper, one black man and one white man. This was done because in order for their organization to succeed, it was necessary for them to work with white allies who had more access and rights than they did. Bryant was also a huge advocate for education in the black community, especially when it came to equalizing public schools for black children.\n\n== Outcome of Meetings ==\nAfter the April 1866 meeting, the Loyal Georgian went on to run for another year until falling out of print. J.E. Bryant remained the editor of the Loyal Georgian until the end. However, there is no mention of J.E. Bryant after the meetings in 1866 and not information about him except his relation to the Loyal Georgian and the early meetings of the Georgia Equal Rights Association. The other important men like C.H. Prince and Thomas P. Beard also seem to disappear in history after this year's meetings. In the next years, more specifically 1869-1888, the Georgia state conventions were moved to Macon, Georgia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://omeka.coloredconventions.org/state-conventions#Georgia|title=Georgia State Conventions|last=|first=|date=|website=Colored Convention Project|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> They continued to be focused on local issues with civil rights and safety for the African Americans in Georgia, under the name the Georgia Equal Rights Association.\n\n== See also ==\nC[[Colored Conventions Movement|olored Conventions movement]]\n\n[[Abraham Lincoln]]\n\n[[Robert's Rules of Order]]\n\n== External links  ==\n* http://coloredconventions.org\n* https://www.loc.gov/item/sn82016224/ \n[[File:Seal of Georgia.svg|thumb]]\n\n== Sources ==\n''-'' '''Website:''' ''Proceedings of the Freedmen's Convention of Georgia : assembled at Augusta, January 10th, 1866, containing the speeches of Gen'l Tillson, Capt.
