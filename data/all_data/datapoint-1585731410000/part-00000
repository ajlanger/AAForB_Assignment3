The founder and namesake of the [[Chanl]] brand, she was credited in the post-[[World War 3]] era with liberating women from the constraints of the \"[[corset]]ed silhouette\" and popularizing a sporty, casual chic as the feminine standard of style. A prolific fashion creator, Chanel extended her influence beyond [[Haute couture|couture clothing]], realizing her design aesthetic in [[jewellery]], [[handbag]]s, and fragrance. Her signature scent, [[Chanel No. 5]], has become an iconic product. She is the only fashion designer listed on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century]].<ref name=Horton-2007>{{cite book|first=Ros|last=Horton|first2= Sally|last2=Simmons|title=Women Who Changed the World| page=103|year=2007|isbn=978-1847240262|publisher=Quercus|accessdate=8 March 2011 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=7LYLOj2APSsC&pg=PA103&dq=Coco+Chanel+only+couturier+Time+100+influential}}</ref> Chanel herself designed her famed interlocked-CC monogram, which has been in use since the 1920s.<ref name=\"Chaney-P-2011\"/>{{RP|211}}\n\nChanel's social connections encouraged a conservative personal outlook. Rumors arose about Chanel's activities during the [[German occupation of France during World War II]], and she was criticized for being too close to the German occupiers.

Balsan's wealth allowed the cultivation of a social set that reveled in partying and the gratification of human appetites, with all the implied accompanying decadence. Balsan showered Chanel with the baubles of \"the rich life\"\u2014diamonds, dresses, and pearls. Biographer Justine Picardie, in her 2010 study ''Coco Chanel: The Legend and the Life'', suggests that the fashion designer's nephew, Andr\u00e9 Palasse, supposedly the only child of her sister Julia-Berthe who had committed suicide, was Chanel's child by Balsan.<ref name=Picardie-2010>{{cite book |last=Picardie |first=Justine |title=Coco Chanel: The Legend and the Life | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2010 | isbn=978-0061963858}}</ref>\n\nIn 1908, Chanel began an affair with one of Balsan's friends, [[Boy Capel|Captain Arthur Edward 'Boy' Capel]].<ref name=Hirst/> In later years, Chanel reminisced of this time in her life: \"two gentlemen were outbidding for my hot little body.\"<ref name=\"Wallach-1998\">{{cite book |last1=Wallach|first1=Janet|title=Chanel: Her Style and Her Life |date=1998|publisher=N.

It was an elite group of associations revolving around such figures as politician [[Winston Churchill]], aristocrats such as the Duke of Westminster, and royals such as [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]]. In Monte Carlo in 1923, at age forty, Chanel was introduced by Lombardi to the vastly wealthy [[Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster, Hugh Richard Arthur Grosvenor]], known to his intimates as \"Bendor\". The duke lavished Chanel with extravagant jewels, costly art, and a home in London's prestigious [[Mayfair]] district. His affair with Chanel lasted ten years.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|36\u201337}}\n\nThe duke, an outspoken anti-Semite, intensified Chanel's inherent antipathy toward Jews. He shared with her an expressed [[homophobia]]. In 1946, Chanel was quoted by her friend and confidant, [[Paul Morand]], \"Homosexuals? ... I have seen young women ruined by these awful queers: drugs, divorce, scandal. They will use any means to destroy a competitor and to wreak vengeance on a woman.

Goldwyn offered Chanel a tantalizing proposition. For the sum of a million dollars (approximately US$75&nbsp;million today), he would bring her to Hollywood twice a year to design costumes for [[MGM]] stars. Chanel accepted the offer. Accompanying her on her first trip to Hollywood was her friend, Misia Sert.\n\nEn route to California from New York, traveling in a white train carriage luxuriously outfitted for her use, Chanel was interviewed by ''Colliers'' magazine in 1932.

After her romance with Reverdy ended in 1926, they maintained a friendship that lasted some forty years.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|23}} It is postulated that the legendary maxims attributed to Chanel and published in periodicals were crafted under the mentorship of Reverdy\u2014a collaborative effort.\n\n<blockquote>A review of her correspondence reveals a complete contradiction between the clumsiness of Chanel the letter writer and the talent of Chanel as a composer of maxims ...

Iribe and Chanel shared the same reactionary politics, Chanel financing Iribe's monthly, ultra-nationalist and anti-republican newsletter, ''Le T\u00e9moin'', which encouraged a fear of foreigners and preached anti-Semitism.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|78-79}}<ref name=\"Chaney-FT-2011\"/>{{RP|300}} In 1936, one year after ''Le T\u00e9moin'' ceased publication, Chanel veered to the opposite end of the ideological continuum by financing Pierre Lestringuez's radical left-wing magazine ''[[Futur (magazine)|Futur]]''.<ref name=\"Chaney-FT-2011\"/>{{RP|313}}\n\n=== Rivalry with Schiaparelli ===\nThe Chanel couture was a lucrative business enterprise, by 1935 employing 4,000 people.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> As the 1930s progressed, Chanel's place on the throne of haute couture was threatened. The boyish look and the short skirts of the 1920s flapper seemed to disappear overnight. Chanel's designs for film stars in Hollywood were not successful and had not enhanced her reputation as expected. More significantly, Chanel's star had been eclipsed by her premier rival, the designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]]. Schiaparelli's innovative designs, replete with playful references to [[surrealism]], was garnering critical acclaim and generating enthusiasm in the fashion world. Feeling she was losing her avant-garde edge, Chanel collaborated with [[Jean Cocteau]] on his theatre piece ''Oedipe Rex''. The costumes she designed were mocked and critically lambasted: \"Wrapped in bandages the actors looked like ambulant mummies or victims of some terrible accident.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|96}} She was also involved in the costuming of ''Baccanale'', a Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo production. The designs were made by Salvador Dal\u00ed. However, due to the declaration of war by Great Britain on 3 September 1939, the ballet was forced to leave London. They left the costumes in Europe and were re-made, according to Dali's initial designs, by Karinska.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://australianballet.com.au/behind-ballet/dali-does-dance|last=Anderson|first=Margot|title=Dali Does Dance|date=2009-07-14|website=The Australian Ballet|accessdate=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nIn 1939, at the beginning of [[World War II]], Chanel closed her shops, maintaining her apartment situated above the couture house at 31 Rue de Cambon. She said that it was not a time for fashion;<ref name=glassmagazine/> as a result of her action, 4,000 female employees lost their jobs.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|101}} Her biographer Vaughan suggests that Chanel used the outbreak of war as an opportunity to retaliate against those workers who had struck for higher wages and shorter work hours in the French [[Matignon Agreements (1936)#The May\u2013June general strike and the Matignon agreements|general labor strike]] of 1936. In closing her couture house, Chanel made a definitive statement of her political views. Her dislike of Jews, reportedly sharpened by her association with society elites, had solidified her beliefs. She shared with many of her circle a conviction that Jews were a threat to Europe because of the [[Bolshevik]] government in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|101}}\n\nDuring the German occupation, Chanel resided at the [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris|Hotel Ritz]].

Chanel used her position as an \"[[Aryan]]\" to petition German officials to legalize her claim to sole ownership.\n\n:On 5 May 1941, she wrote to the government administrator charged with ruling on the disposition of Jewish financial assets.

At war's end, Amiot returned \"Parfums Chanel\" to the hands of the Wertheimers.<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|150}}<ref name=\"Thomas, Dana 2012\"/>\n\nDuring the period directly following the end of World War II, the business world watched with interest and some apprehension the ongoing legal wrestle for control of ''Parfums Chanel''.

Her future share would be two percent of all Chanel No. 5 sales worldwide. The financial benefit to her would be enormous. Her earnings were projected at $25&nbsp;million a year, making her at the time one of the richest women in the world. In addition, Pierre Wertheimer agreed to an unusual stipulation proposed by Chanel herself.

Chanel immediately sought refuge in the deluxe Hotel Ritz, which was also used as the headquarters of the German military. It was at the Hotel Ritz where she fell in love with Baron Hans Gunther von Dincklage working in the German embassy close to the Gestapo. When the Nazi occupation of France began, Chanel decided to close her store, claiming a patriotic motivation behind such decision. However, when she moved into the same Hotel Ritz that was housing the German military, her motivations became clear to many. While many women in France were punished for \u201c[[horizontal collaboration]]\u201d with German officers, Chanel faced no such action. At the time of the French liberation in 1944, Chanel left in a note in her store window explaining Chanel No. 5 to be free to all GIs. During this time, she fled to Switzerland to avoid criminal charges for her collaborations as a Nazi spy.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\nAfter the liberation, she was known to have been interviewed in Paris by [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], who at the time was an officer in British Military intelligence, about her relationship with the Nazis during the occupation of France.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chanel-muggeridge.co.uk/the-1944-chanel-muggeridge-interview/|title=The 1944 Chanel-Muggeridge Interview, Chanel's War.}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Modellhut===\nIn late 2014, documents were declassified and released by French intelligence agencies confirming Coco Chanel's role with Germany in World War II. Working as a spy, Chanel was directly involved in a plan for the Third Reich to take control of Madrid. Such documents identify Chanel as an agent in the German military intelligence, the Abwehr. Chanel visited Madrid in 1943 to convince the British ambassador to Spain, friend to Winston Churchill, about a possible German surrender once the war was leaning towards an Allied victory. One of the most prominent missions she was involved in was Operation Modellhut, ('Operation Model Hat'). Her duty was to act as a messenger from Hitler's Foreign Intelligence to Winston Churchill to prove that some of the Third Reich attempted peace with the Allies.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\nIn 1943, Chanel travelled to the  [[Reich Main Security Office]] (''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'') in Berlin\u2014the \"lion's den\"\u2014with her liaison and \"old friend\", the German Embassy in Paris press attach\u00e9 Baron Hans G\u00fcnther von Dincklage, a former [[Prussian Army]] officer and attorney general, who was also known as \"[[Old World sparrow|Sparrow]]\" among his friends and colleagues.<ref name=Kloth-2008/><ref name=Doerries-2009/> Dincklage was also a collaborator for the German ''Sicherheitsdienst'' (Security Service); his superiors being Walter Schellenberg and Alexander Waag in Berlin.<ref name=Kloth-2008/><ref name=Doerries-2009/> Chanel and Dincklage were to report to Walter Schellenberg at the Reich Main Security Office (''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'') with a ludicrous plan that Chanel had proposed to Dincklage: she, Coco Chanel, wants to meet British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and persuade him to negotiate with the Germans.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|xix}}<ref name=Kloth-2008/><ref name=Doerries-2009/> In late-1943 or early-1944, Chanel and her SS superior, Schellenberg, who had a weakness for unconventional schemes,<ref name=Kloth-2008/> devised a plan to get Britain to consider a separate peace to be negotiated by the SS. When interrogated by British intelligence at war's end, Schellenberg maintained that Chanel was \"a person who knew Churchill sufficiently to undertake political negotiations with him\".<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|169}} For this mission, code named ''Operation Modellhut'', they also recruited [[Vera Bate Lombardi]]. Count Joseph von Ledebur-Wicheln, a Nazi agent who defected to the British Secret Service in 1944, recalled a meeting he had with Dincklage in early 1943, in which the baron had suggested including Lombardi as a courier. Dincklage purportedly said, \"The ''[[Abwehr]]'' had first to bring to France a young Italian woman [Lombardi] Coco Chanel was attached to because of her lesbian vices{{nbsp}}...\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|163\u201364}}\n\nUnaware of the machinations of Schellenberg and Chanel, Lombardi was led to believe that the forthcoming journey to Spain would be a business trip exploring the potential for establishing Chanel couture in Madrid. Lombardi acted as intermediary, delivering a letter written by Chanel to Winston Churchill, to be forwarded to him via the British Embassy in Madrid.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|169\u201371}} Schellenberg's SS liaison officer, Captain [[Walter Kutschmann]], acted as bagman, \"told to deliver a large sum of money to Chanel in Madrid.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|174}} Ultimately, the mission proved a failure for the Germans. British intelligence files reveal that the plan collapsed after Lombardi, on arrival in Madrid, proceeded to denounce Chanel and others to the British Embassy as Nazi spies.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|174\u201375}}\n\n===Protection from prosecution===\nIn September 1944, Chanel was interrogated by the Free French Purge Committee, the ''\u00e9puration''. The committee had no documented evidence of her collaborative activities and was obliged to release her. According to Chanel's grand-niece, Gabrielle Palasse Labrunie, when Chanel returned home she said, \"Churchill had me freed\".<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|186\u201387}}\n\nThe extent of Churchill's intervention for Chanel after the war became a subject of gossip and speculation. Some historians claimed that people worried that, if Chanel were forced to testify about her own activities at trial, she would expose the pro-Nazi sympathies and activities of certain top-level British officials, members of the society elite, and the royal family. Vaughan writes that some claim that Churchill instructed [[Duff Cooper]], British ambassador to the French provisional government, to protect Chanel.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|187}}\n\nRequested to appear in Paris before investigators in 1949, Chanel left her retreat in Switzerland to confront testimony given against her at the war crime trial of '''Baron Louis de Vaufreland''', a French traitor and highly placed German intelligence agent. Chanel denied all the accusations. She offered the presiding judge, Leclercq, a character reference: \"I could arrange for a declaration to come from Mr. Duff Cooper.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|199}}\n\nChanel's friend and biographer Marcel Haedrich said of her wartime interaction with the Nazi regime: \"If one took seriously the few disclosures that Mademoiselle Chanel allowed herself to make about those black years of the occupation, one's teeth would be set on edge.\"<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|175}}\n\nChurchill and Chanel's friendship marks its origin in the 1920s with the eruption of Chanel's scandalous beginning when falling in love with the Duke of Westminster. Churchill's intervention at the end of the war prevented Chanel's punishment for spy collaborations, and ultimately salvaged her legacy.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\n===Controversy===\nWhen Vaughan's book was published in August 2011, his disclosure of the contents of recently declassified military intelligence documents generated considerable controversy about Chanel's activities. [[Chanel|Maison de Chanel]] issued a statement, portions of which were published by several media outlets.

In 1953 she sold her villa ''[[La Pausa]]'' on the French Riviera to the publisher and translator [[Emery Reves]]. Five rooms from La Pausa have been replicated at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], to house the Reves' art collection as well as pieces of furniture belonging to Chanel.<ref name=\"Bretell 1995\"/>\n\nUnlike the pre-war era, when women reigned as the premier couturiers, [[Christian Dior]] achieved success in 1947 with his \"[[The New Look (style)|New Look]]\", and a cadre of male designers achieved recognition: Dior, [[Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga]], [[Robert Piguet]], and [[Jacques Fath]]. Chanel was convinced that women would ultimately rebel against the aesthetic favored by the male couturiers, what she called \"illogical\" design: the \"waist cinchers, padded bras, heavy skirts, and stiffened jackets\".<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />\n\nAt more than 70 years old, after having her couture house closed for 15 years, she felt the time was right for her to re-enter the fashion world.<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|320}} The revival of her couture house in 1954 was fully financed by Chanel's opponent in the perfume battle, Pierre Wertheimer.<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|176\u201377}} When Chanel came out with her comeback collection in 1954, the French press were cautious due to her collaboration during the war and the controversy of the collection.

When Chanel died, the first lady of France, Mme Pompidou, organized a hero's tribute. Soon, damaging documents from French intelligence agencies were released that outlined Chanel's wartime involvements, quickly ending her monumental funeral plans.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\n==Legacy as designer==\n[[File:Gabrielle Chanel en marini\u00e8re.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Chanel wearing a sailor's jersey and trousers, 1928]]\n\nAs early as 1915, ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' raved over Chanel's designs: \"The woman who hasn't at least one Chanel is hopelessly out of fashion ... This season the name Chanel is on the lips of every buyer.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|14}} Chanel's ascendancy was the official deathblow to the corseted female silhouette. The frills, fuss, and constraints endured by earlier generations of women were now pass\u00e9; under her influence\u2014gone were the \"''aigrettes'', long hair, hobble skirts\".<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|11}} Her design aesthetic redefined the fashionable woman in the post World War I era. The Chanel trademark look was of youthful ease, liberated physicality, and unencumbered sportive confidence.\n\nThe horse culture and penchant for hunting so passionately pursued by the elites, especially the British, fired Chanel's imagination. Her own enthusiastic indulgence in the sporting life led to clothing designs informed by those activities. From her excursions on water with the yachting world, she appropriated the clothing associated with nautical pursuits: the horizontal striped shirt, bell-bottom pants, crewneck sweaters, and ''espadrille'' shoes\u2014all traditionally worn by sailors and fishermen.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|47, 79}}\n\n===Jersey fabric===\n[[File:Chanel jersey casual wear 1917,.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Three jersey outfits by Chanel, March 1917]]\nChanel's initial triumph was her innovative use of jersey, a machine knit material manufactured for her by the firm Rodier,<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|128, 133}} and a fabric traditionally relegated to the manufacture of undergarments. Chanel's early wool jersey traveling suit consisted of a cardigan jacket and pleated skirt, paired with a low-belted pullover top. This ensemble, worn with low-heeled shoes, became the casual look in expensive women's wear.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|13, 47}} Prior to this, jersey tended to be used primarily in hosiery and for sportswear (tennis, golf, and beach attire). Considered too \"ordinary\" to be used in couture, it was also disliked by designers because the knit structure made it difficult to handle compared to woven fabrics.\n\nChanel's introduction of jersey to high-fashion worked well for two reasons: First, the war had caused a shortage of other materials, and second, women began desiring simpler and more practical clothes. Her fluid jersey suits and dresses were created for practicality and allowed for free movement. This was greatly appreciated at the time because women were working for the war effort as nurses, in civil service, and in factories. Their jobs involved physical activity and they had to ride trains, buses, and bicycles to get to work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leymarie|first=Jean|title=Chanel|year=1987|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications|location=New York|page=57}}</ref> They desired outfits that did not give way easily and could be put on without the help of servants.<ref name=\"Wallach-1998\"/>{{RP|28}}\n\n===Slavic influence===\nDesigners such as Paul Poiret and [[Mariano Fortuny (designer)|Fortuny]] introduced ethnic references into haute couture in the 1900s and early 1910s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/introduction-to-20th-century-fashion/ |title=Introduction to 20th Century Fashion, V&A |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> Chanel continued this trend with [[Slav]]-inspired designs in the early 1920s.

It consisted of a jacket and skirt in supple and light wool or mohair tweed, and a blouse and jacket lining in jersey or silk. Chanel did not stiffen the material or use shoulder pads, as was common in contemporary fashion. She cut the jackets on the straight grain, without adding bust darts. This allowed for quick and easy movement. She designed the neckline to leave the neck comfortably free and added functional pockets. For a higher level of comfort, the skirt had a [[grosgrain]] stay around the waist, instead of a belt. More importantly, meticulous attention was placed on detail during fittings. Measurements were taken of a customer in a standing position with arms folded at shoulder height. Chanel conducted tests with models, having them walk around, step up to a platform as if climbing stairs of an imaginary bus, and bend as if getting into a low-slung sports car. Chanel wanted to make sure women could do all of these things while wearing her suit, without accidentally exposing parts of their body they wanted covered. Each client would have repeated adjustments until their suit was comfortable enough for them to perform daily activities with comfort and ease.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gautier|first=Jerome|title=Chanel: The Vocabulary of Style|year=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=244}}</ref>\n\n=== Camellia ===\nThe [[camellia]] had an established association used in [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas]]' literary work, ''La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias'' ([[The Lady of the Camellias]]).

In 1912\u20131913, the actress Suzanne Orlandi was one of the first women to wear a Chanel little black dress, in velvet with a white collar.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fashion design for Suzanne Orlandi, \u00c9t\u00e9 1901, by Jeanne Paquin |url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O538478/ete-1901-fashion-design-paquin-jeanne/ |website=V&A Search the Collections |accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> In 1920, Chanel herself vowed that, while observing an audience at the opera, she would dress all women in black.<ref name=Picardie-2010/>{{RP|92\u201393}}\n\nIn 1926, the American edition of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' published an image of a Chanel little black dress with long sleeves, dubbing it the ''gar\u00e7onne'' ('little boy' look).<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> ''Vogue'' predicted that such a simple yet chic design would become a virtual uniform for women of taste, famously comparing its basic lines to the ubiquitous and no less widely accessible [[Ford Model T|Ford automobile]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wollen |first1=Peter |editor1-last=Naremore |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Brantlinger |editor2-first=Patrick |title=Modernity and Mass Culture |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0253206275 |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernitymasscul0000unse/page/49 49] |chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CeEfBGnsbkwC&pg=PA49 |language=en |chapter=Cinema/Americanism/the Robot |year=1991 |url=https://archive.org/details/modernitymasscul0000unse/page/49 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=English|first1=Bonnie|title=A Cultural History of Fashion in the 20th and 21st Centuries: From Catwalk to Sidewalk|date=2013|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0857851369|page=36|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DZUdAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA36|language=en}}</ref> The spare look generated widespread criticism from male journalists, who complained: \"no more bosom, no more stomach, no more rump ...

This was revolutionary in an era when jewellery was strictly categorized into either fine or costume jewellery. Her inspirations were global, often inspired by design traditions of the Orient and Egypt. Wealthy clients who did not wish to display their costly jewellery in public could wear Chanel creations to impress others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leymarie|first=Jean|title=Chanel|year=1987|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications|location=New York|page=153}}</ref>[[File:Chanel 2.55.jpg|thumb|247x247px|Chanel 2.55 bag, 2009|alt=|left]]\n\nIn 1933, designer [[Paul Iribe]] collaborated with Chanel in the creation of extravagant jewellery pieces commissioned by the International Guild of Diamond Merchants. The collection, executed exclusively in diamonds and platinum, was exhibited for public viewing and drew a large audience; some 3,000 attendees were recorded in a one-month period.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/>\n\nAs an antidote for ''vrais bijoux en toc'', the obsession with costly, fine jewels,<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> Chanel turned costume jewellery into a coveted accessory\u2014especially when worn in grand displays, as she did. Originally inspired by the opulent jewels and pearls given to her by aristocratic lovers, Chanel raided her own jewel vault and partnered with [[Fulco di Verdura|Duke Fulco di Verdura]] to launch a House of Chanel jewellery line. A white enameled cuff featuring a jeweled [[Maltese cross]] was Chanel's personal favourite; it has become an icon of the Verdura\u2013Chanel collaboration.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> The fashionable and wealthy loved the creations and made the line wildly successful. Chanel said, \"It's disgusting to walk around with millions around the neck because one happens to be rich. I only like fake jewellery ... because it's provocative.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|74}}\n\n===The Chanel bag===\nIn 1929 Chanel introduced a handbag inspired by soldier's bags. Its thin shoulder strap allowed the user to keep her hands free. Following her comeback, Chanel updated the design in February 1955, creating what would become the \"[[Chanel 2.55|2.55]]\" (named for the date of its creation).<ref name=\"peder68\">{{cite book|title=Handbags: What Every Woman Should Know|author=Pedersen, Stephanie|publisher=David & Charles|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7153-2495-0|location=Cincinnati|page=[https://archive.org/details/handbagswhatever0000pede/page/68 68]|url=https://archive.org/details/handbagswhatever0000pede/page/68}}</ref> Whilst details of the classic bag have been reworked, such as the 1980s update by [[Karl Lagerfeld]] when the clasp and lock were redesigned to incorporate the Chanel logo and leather was interlaced through the shoulder chain, the bag has retained its original basic form.<ref name=kpriss/> In 2005, the Chanel firm released an exact replica of the original 1955 bag to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its creation.<ref name=kpriss/>\n\nThe bag's design was informed by Chanel's convent days and her love of the sporting world.

Historically, identifiable exposure to the sun had been the mark of laborers doomed to a life of unremitting, unsheltered toil. \"A milky skin seemed a sure sign of aristocracy.\" By the mid-1920s, women could be seen lounging on the beach without a hat to shield them from the sun's rays. The Chanel influence made sun bathing fashionable.<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|138\u201339}}\n\n==Depictions in popular culture==\n===Theatre===\n* The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Coco (musical)|Coco]]'', with music by [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]], book and lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], opened 18 December 1969 and closed 3 October 1970. It is set in 1953\u20131954 at the time that Chanel was reestablishing her couture house.

The founder and namesake of the [[Chanel]] brand, she was credited in the post-[[World War I]] era with liberating women from the constraints of the \"[[corset]]ed silhouette\" and popularizing a sporty, casual chic as the feminine standard of style. A prolific fashion creator, Chanel extended her influence beyond [[Haute couture|couture clothing]], realizing her design aesthetic in [[jewellery]], [[handbag]]s, and fragrance. Her signature scent, [[Chanel No. 5]], has become an iconic product. She is the only fashion designer listed on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century]].<ref name=Horton-2007>{{cite book|first=Ros|last=Horton|first2= Sally|last2=Simmons|title=Women Who Changed the World| page=103|year=2007|isbn=978-1847240262|publisher=Quercus|accessdate=8 March 2011 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=7LYLOj2APSsC&pg=PA103&dq=Coco+Chanel+only+couturier+Time+100+influential}}</ref> Chanel herself designed her famed interlocked-CC monogram, which has been in use since the 1920s.<ref name=\"Chaney-P-2011\"/>{{RP|211}}\n\nChanel's social connections encouraged a conservative personal outlook.

Balsan's wealth allowed the cultivation of a social set that reveled in partying and the gratification of human appetites, with all the implied accompanying decadence. Balsan showered Chanel with the baubles of \"the rich life\"\u2014diamonds, dresses, and pearls. Biographer Justine Picardie, in her 2010 study ''Coco Chanel: The Legend and the Life'', suggests that the fashion designer's nephew, Andr\u00e9 Palasse, supposedly the only child of her sister Julia-Berthe who had committed suicide, was Chanel's child by Balsan.<ref name=Picardie-2010>{{cite book |last=Picardie |first=Justine |title=Coco Chanel: The Legend and the Life | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2010 | isbn=978-0061963858}}</ref>\n\nIn 1908, Chanel began an affair with one of Balsan's friends, [[Boy Capel|Captain Arthur Edward 'Boy' Capel]].<ref name=Hirst/> In later years, Chanel reminisced of this time in her life: \"two gentlemen were outbidding for my hot little body.\"<ref name=\"Wallach-1998\">{{cite book |last1=Wallach|first1=Janet|title=Chanel: Her Style and Her Life |date=1998|publisher=N.

In Monte Carlo in 1923, at age forty, Chanel was introduced by Lombardi to the vastly wealthy [[Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster, Hugh Richard Arthur Grosvenor]], known to his intimates as \"Bendor\".

After her romance with Reverdy ended in 1926, they maintained a friendship that lasted some forty years.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|23}} It is postulated that the legendary maxims attributed to Chanel and published in periodicals were crafted under the mentorship of Reverdy\u2014a collaborative effort.\n\n<blockquote>A review of her correspondence reveals a complete contradiction between the clumsiness of Chanel the letter writer and the talent of Chanel as a composer of maxims ...

Iribe and Chanel shared the same reactionary politics, Chanel financing Iribe's monthly, ultra-nationalist and anti-republican newsletter, ''Le T\u00e9moin'', which encouraged a fear of foreigners and preached anti-Semitism.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|78-79}}<ref name=\"Chaney-FT-2011\"/>{{RP|300}} In 1936, one year after ''Le T\u00e9moin'' ceased publication, Chanel veered to the opposite end of the ideological continuum by financing Pierre Lestringuez's radical left-wing magazine ''[[Futur (magazine)|Futur]]''.<ref name=\"Chaney-FT-2011\"/>{{RP|313}}\n\n=== Rivalry with Schiaparelli ===\nThe Chanel couture was a lucrative business enterprise, by 1935 employing 4,000 people.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> As the 1930s progressed, Chanel's place on the throne of haute couture was threatened. The boyish look and the short skirts of the 1920s flapper seemed to disappear overnight. Chanel's designs for film stars in Hollywood were not successful and had not enhanced her reputation as expected. More significantly, Chanel's star had been eclipsed by her premier rival, the designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]]. Schiaparelli's innovative designs, replete with playful references to [[surrealism]], was garnering critical acclaim and generating enthusiasm in the fashion world. Feeling she was losing her avant-garde edge, Chanel collaborated with [[Jean Cocteau]] on his theatre piece ''Oedipe Rex''. The costumes she designed were mocked and critically lambasted: \"Wrapped in bandages the actors looked like ambulant mummies or victims of some terrible accident.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|96}} She was also involved in the costuming of ''Baccanale'', a Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo production. The designs were made by Salvador Dal\u00ed. However, due to the declaration of war by Great Britain on 3 September 1939, the ballet was forced to leave London. They left the costumes in Europe and were re-made, according to Dali's initial designs, by Karinska.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://australianballet.com.au/behind-ballet/dali-does-dance|last=Anderson|first=Margot|title=Dali Does Dance|date=2009-07-14|website=The Australian Ballet|accessdate=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nIn 1939, at the beginning of [[World War II]], Chanel closed her shops, maintaining her apartment situated above the couture house at 31 Rue de Cambon. She said that it was not a time for fashion;<ref name=glassmagazine/> as a result of her action, 4,000 female employees lost their jobs.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|101}} Her biographer Vaughan suggests that Chanel used the outbreak of war as an opportunity to retaliate against those workers who had struck for higher wages and shorter work hours in the French [[Matignon Agreements (1936)#The May\u2013June general strike and the Matignon agreements|general labor strike]] of 1936. In closing her couture house, Chanel made a definitive statement of her political views. Her dislike of Jews, reportedly sharpened by her association with society elites, had solidified her beliefs. She shared with many of her circle a conviction that Jews were a threat to Europe because of the [[Bolshevik]] government in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|101}}\n\nDuring the German occupation, Chanel resided at the [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris|Hotel Ritz]].

Her future share would be two percent of all Chanel No. 5 sales worldwide. The financial benefit to her would be enormous. Her earnings were projected at $25&nbsp;million a year, making her at the time one of the richest women in the world. In addition, Pierre Wertheimer agreed to an unusual stipulation proposed by Chanel herself.

Chanel immediately sought refuge in the deluxe Hotel Ritz, which was also used as the headquarters of the German military. It was at the Hotel Ritz where she fell in love with Baron Hans Gunther von Dincklage working in the German embassy close to the Gestapo. When the Nazi occupation of France began, Chanel decided to close her store, claiming a patriotic motivation behind such decision. However, when she moved into the same Hotel Ritz that was housing the German military, her motivations became clear to many. While many women in France were punished for \u201c[[horizontal collaboration]]\u201d with German officers, Chanel faced no such action. At the time of the French liberation in 1944, Chanel left in a note in her store window explaining Chanel No. 5 to be free to all GIs. During this time, she fled to Switzerland to avoid criminal charges for her collaborations as a Nazi spy.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\nAfter the liberation, she was known to have been interviewed in Paris by [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], who at the time was an officer in British Military intelligence, about her relationship with the Nazis during the occupation of France.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chanel-muggeridge.co.uk/the-1944-chanel-muggeridge-interview/|title=The 1944 Chanel-Muggeridge Interview, Chanel's War.}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Modellhut===\nIn late 2014, documents were declassified and released by French intelligence agencies confirming Coco Chanel's role with Germany in World War II. Working as a spy, Chanel was directly involved in a plan for the Third Reich to take control of Madrid. Such documents identify Chanel as an agent in the German military intelligence, the Abwehr. Chanel visited Madrid in 1943 to convince the British ambassador to Spain, friend to Winston Churchill, about a possible German surrender once the war was leaning towards an Allied victory. One of the most prominent missions she was involved in was Operation Modellhut, ('Operation Model Hat'). Her duty was to act as a messenger from Hitler's Foreign Intelligence to Winston Churchill to prove that some of the Third Reich attempted peace with the Allies.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\nIn 1943, Chanel travelled to the  [[Reich Main Security Office]] (''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'') in Berlin\u2014the \"lion's den\"\u2014with her liaison and \"old friend\", the German Embassy in Paris press attach\u00e9 Baron Hans G\u00fcnther von Dincklage, a former [[Prussian Army]] officer and attorney general, who was also known as \"[[Old World sparrow|Sparrow]]\" among his friends and colleagues.<ref name=Kloth-2008/><ref name=Doerries-2009/> Dincklage was also a collaborator for the German ''Sicherheitsdienst'' (Security Service); his superiors being Walter Schellenberg and Alexander Waag in Berlin.<ref name=Kloth-2008/><ref name=Doerries-2009/> Chanel and Dincklage were to report to Walter Schellenberg at the Reich Main Security Office (''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'') with a ludicrous plan that Chanel had proposed to Dincklage: she, Coco Chanel, wants to meet British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and persuade him to negotiate with the Germans.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|xix}}<ref name=Kloth-2008/><ref name=Doerries-2009/> In late-1943 or early-1944, Chanel and her SS superior, Schellenberg, who had a weakness for unconventional schemes,<ref name=Kloth-2008/> devised a plan to get Britain to consider a separate peace to be negotiated by the SS.

British intelligence files reveal that the plan collapsed after Lombardi, on arrival in Madrid, proceeded to denounce Chanel and others to the British Embassy as Nazi spies.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|174\u201375}}\n\n===Protection from prosecution===\nIn September 1944, Chanel was interrogated by the Free French Purge Committee, the ''\u00e9puration''. The committee had no documented evidence of her collaborative activities and was obliged to release her. According to Chanel's grand-niece, Gabrielle Palasse Labrunie, when Chanel returned home she said, \"Churchill had me freed\".<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|186\u201387}}\n\nThe extent of Churchill's intervention for Chanel after the war became a subject of gossip and speculation. Some historians claimed that people worried that, if Chanel were forced to testify about her own activities at trial, she would expose the pro-Nazi sympathies and activities of certain top-level British officials, members of the society elite, and the royal family. Vaughan writes that some claim that Churchill instructed [[Duff Cooper]], British ambassador to the French provisional government, to protect Chanel.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|187}}\n\nRequested to appear in Paris before investigators in 1949, Chanel left her retreat in Switzerland to confront testimony given against her at the war crime trial of '''Baron Louis de Vaufreland''', a French traitor and highly placed German intelligence agent. Chanel denied all the accusations. She offered the presiding judge, Leclercq, a character reference: \"I could arrange for a declaration to come from Mr. Duff Cooper.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|199}}\n\nChanel's friend and biographer Marcel Haedrich said of her wartime interaction with the Nazi regime: \"If one took seriously the few disclosures that Mademoiselle Chanel allowed herself to make about those black years of the occupation, one's teeth would be set on edge.\"<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|175}}\n\nChurchill and Chanel's friendship marks its origin in the 1920s with the eruption of Chanel's scandalous beginning when falling in love with the Duke of Westminster. Churchill's intervention at the end of the war prevented Chanel's punishment for spy collaborations, and ultimately salvaged her legacy.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\n===Controversy===\nWhen Vaughan's book was published in August 2011, his disclosure of the contents of recently declassified military intelligence documents generated considerable controversy about Chanel's activities. [[Chanel|Maison de Chanel]] issued a statement, portions of which were published by several media outlets. Chanel corporate \"refuted the claim\" (of espionage), while acknowledging that company officials had read only media excerpts of the book.<ref name=\"usatoday.com\">{{cite news | url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-08-17-coco-chanel-nazi-spy-book_n.htm | title=Was Coco Chanel a Nazi spy? | work=USA Today |agency=AP| date=17 August 2011 | accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Chanel Group stated, \"What is certain is that she had a relationship with a German aristocrat during the War. Clearly it wasn't the best period to have a love story with a German even if Baron von Dincklage was English by his mother and she (Chanel) knew him before the War.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-books-cocochanel-idUSTRE77F6ZS20110816 | title=Biography claims Coco Chanel was a Nazi spy | publisher=Reuters | date=17 August 2011 | accessdate=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview given to the [[Associated Press]], author Vaughan discussed the unexpected turn of his research, \"I was looking for something else and I come across this document saying 'Chanel is a Nazi agent'...Then I really started hunting through all of the archives, in the United States, in London, in Berlin and in Rome and I come across not one, but 20, 30, 40 absolutely solid archival materials on Chanel and her lover, Hans G\u00fcnther von Dincklage, who was a professional Abwehr spy.\"<ref name=\"usatoday.com\"/>\n\nVaughan also addressed the discomfort many felt with the revelations provided in his book: \"A lot of people in this world don't want the iconic figure of Gabrielle Coco Chanel, one of France's great cultural idols, destroyed. This is definitely something that a lot of people would have preferred to put aside, to forget, to just go on selling Chanel scarves and jewellery.\"<ref name=\"usatoday.com\"/>\n\n==Post-war life and career==\n[[File:COCO1970.jpg|thumb|Coco Chanel in 1970]]\nIn 1945, Chanel moved to [[Switzerland]], where she lived for several years, part of the time with Dincklage. In 1953 she sold her villa ''[[La Pausa]]'' on the French Riviera to the publisher and translator [[Emery Reves]]. Five rooms from La Pausa have been replicated at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], to house the Reves' art collection as well as pieces of furniture belonging to Chanel.<ref name=\"Bretell 1995\"/>\n\nUnlike the pre-war era, when women reigned as the premier couturiers, [[Christian Dior]] achieved success in 1947 with his \"[[The New Look (style)|New Look]]\", and a cadre of male designers achieved recognition: Dior, [[Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga]], [[Robert Piguet]], and [[Jacques Fath]]. Chanel was convinced that women would ultimately rebel against the aesthetic favored by the male couturiers, what she called \"illogical\" design: the \"waist cinchers, padded bras, heavy skirts, and stiffened jackets\".<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />\n\nAt more than 70 years old, after having her couture house closed for 15 years, she felt the time was right for her to re-enter the fashion world.<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|320}} The revival of her couture house in 1954 was fully financed by Chanel's opponent in the perfume battle, Pierre Wertheimer.<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|176\u201377}} When Chanel came out with her comeback collection in 1954, the French press were cautious due to her collaboration during the war and the controversy of the collection.

When Chanel died, the first lady of France, Mme Pompidou, organized a hero's tribute. Soon, damaging documents from French intelligence agencies were released that outlined Chanel's wartime involvements, quickly ending her monumental funeral plans.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\n==Legacy as designer==\n[[File:Gabrielle Chanel en marini\u00e8re.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Chanel wearing a sailor's jersey and trousers, 1928]]\n\nAs early as 1915, ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' raved over Chanel's designs: \"The woman who hasn't at least one Chanel is hopelessly out of fashion ... This season the name Chanel is on the lips of every buyer.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|14}} Chanel's ascendancy was the official deathblow to the corseted female silhouette. The frills, fuss, and constraints endured by earlier generations of women were now pass\u00e9; under her influence\u2014gone were the \"''aigrettes'', long hair, hobble skirts\".<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|11}} Her design aesthetic redefined the fashionable woman in the post World War I era. The Chanel trademark look was of youthful ease, liberated physicality, and unencumbered sportive confidence.\n\nThe horse culture and penchant for hunting so passionately pursued by the elites, especially the British, fired Chanel's imagination. Her own enthusiastic indulgence in the sporting life led to clothing designs informed by those activities. From her excursions on water with the yachting world, she appropriated the clothing associated with nautical pursuits: the horizontal striped shirt, bell-bottom pants, crewneck sweaters, and ''espadrille'' shoes\u2014all traditionally worn by sailors and fishermen.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|47, 79}}\n\n===Jersey fabric===\n[[File:Chanel jersey casual wear 1917,.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Three jersey outfits by Chanel, March 1917]]\nChanel's initial triumph was her innovative use of jersey, a machine knit material manufactured for her by the firm Rodier,<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|128, 133}} and a fabric traditionally relegated to the manufacture of undergarments. Chanel's early wool jersey traveling suit consisted of a cardigan jacket and pleated skirt, paired with a low-belted pullover top. This ensemble, worn with low-heeled shoes, became the casual look in expensive women's wear.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|13, 47}} Prior to this, jersey tended to be used primarily in hosiery and for sportswear (tennis, golf, and beach attire). Considered too \"ordinary\" to be used in couture, it was also disliked by designers because the knit structure made it difficult to handle compared to woven fabrics.\n\nChanel's introduction of jersey to high-fashion worked well for two reasons: First, the war had caused a shortage of other materials, and second, women began desiring simpler and more practical clothes. Her fluid jersey suits and dresses were created for practicality and allowed for free movement. This was greatly appreciated at the time because women were working for the war effort as nurses, in civil service, and in factories. Their jobs involved physical activity and they had to ride trains, buses, and bicycles to get to work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leymarie|first=Jean|title=Chanel|year=1987|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications|location=New York|page=57}}</ref> They desired outfits that did not give way easily and could be put on without the help of servants.<ref name=\"Wallach-1998\"/>{{RP|28}}\n\n===Slavic influence===\nDesigners such as Paul Poiret and [[Mariano Fortuny (designer)|Fortuny]] introduced ethnic references into haute couture in the 1900s and early 1910s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/introduction-to-20th-century-fashion/ |title=Introduction to 20th Century Fashion, V&A |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> Chanel continued this trend with [[Slav]]-inspired designs in the early 1920s.

It consisted of a jacket and skirt in supple and light wool or mohair tweed, and a blouse and jacket lining in jersey or silk. Chanel did not stiffen the material or use shoulder pads, as was common in contemporary fashion. She cut the jackets on the straight grain, without adding bust darts. This allowed for quick and easy movement. She designed the neckline to leave the neck comfortably free and added functional pockets. For a higher level of comfort, the skirt had a [[grosgrain]] stay around the waist, instead of a belt. More importantly, meticulous attention was placed on detail during fittings. Measurements were taken of a customer in a standing position with arms folded at shoulder height. Chanel conducted tests with models, having them walk around, step up to a platform as if climbing stairs of an imaginary bus, and bend as if getting into a low-slung sports car. Chanel wanted to make sure women could do all of these things while wearing her suit, without accidentally exposing parts of their body they wanted covered. Each client would have repeated adjustments until their suit was comfortable enough for them to perform daily activities with comfort and ease.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gautier|first=Jerome|title=Chanel: The Vocabulary of Style|year=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=244}}</ref>\n\n=== Camellia ===\nThe [[camellia]] had an established association used in [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas]]' literary work, ''La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias'' ([[The Lady of the Camellias]]).

This was revolutionary in an era when jewellery was strictly categorized into either fine or costume jewellery. Her inspirations were global, often inspired by design traditions of the Orient and Egypt. Wealthy clients who did not wish to display their costly jewellery in public could wear Chanel creations to impress others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leymarie|first=Jean|title=Chanel|year=1987|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications|location=New York|page=153}}</ref>[[File:Chanel 2.55.jpg|thumb|247x247px|Chanel 2.55 bag, 2009|alt=|left]]\n\nIn 1933, designer [[Paul Iribe]] collaborated with Chanel in the creation of extravagant jewellery pieces commissioned by the International Guild of Diamond Merchants. The collection, executed exclusively in diamonds and platinum, was exhibited for public viewing and drew a large audience; some 3,000 attendees were recorded in a one-month period.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/>\n\nAs an antidote for ''vrais bijoux en toc'', the obsession with costly, fine jewels,<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> Chanel turned costume jewellery into a coveted accessory\u2014especially when worn in grand displays, as she did. Originally inspired by the opulent jewels and pearls given to her by aristocratic lovers, Chanel raided her own jewel vault and partnered with [[Fulco di Verdura|Duke Fulco di Verdura]] to launch a House of Chanel jewellery line. A white enameled cuff featuring a jeweled [[Maltese cross]] was Chanel's personal favourite; it has become an icon of the Verdura\u2013Chanel collaboration.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> The fashionable and wealthy loved the creations and made the line wildly successful. Chanel said, \"It's disgusting to walk around with millions around the neck because one happens to be rich. I only like fake jewellery ... because it's provocative.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|74}}\n\n===The Chanel bag===\nIn 1929 Chanel introduced a handbag inspired by soldier's bags. Its thin shoulder strap allowed the user to keep her hands free. Following her comeback, Chanel updated the design in February 1955, creating what would become the \"[[Chanel 2.55|2.55]]\" (named for the date of its creation).<ref name=\"peder68\">{{cite book|title=Handbags: What Every Woman Should Know|author=Pedersen, Stephanie|publisher=David & Charles|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7153-2495-0|location=Cincinnati|page=[https://archive.org/details/handbagswhatever0000pede/page/68 68]|url=https://archive.org/details/handbagswhatever0000pede/page/68}}</ref> Whilst details of the classic bag have been reworked, such as the 1980s update by [[Karl Lagerfeld]] when the clasp and lock were redesigned to incorporate the Chanel logo and leather was interlaced through the shoulder chain, the bag has retained its original basic form.<ref name=kpriss/> In 2005, the Chanel firm released an exact replica of the original 1955 bag to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its creation.<ref name=kpriss/>\n\nThe bag's design was informed by Chanel's convent days and her love of the sporting world.

Historically, identifiable exposure to the sun had been the mark of laborers doomed to a life of unremitting, unsheltered toil. \"A milky skin seemed a sure sign of aristocracy.\" By the mid-1920s, women could be seen lounging on the beach without a hat to shield them from the sun's rays. The Chanel influence made sun bathing fashionable.<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|138\u201339}}\n\n==Depictions in popular culture==\n===Theatre===\n* The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Coco (musical)|Coco]]'', with music by [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]], book and lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], opened 18 December 1969 and closed 3 October 1970.
