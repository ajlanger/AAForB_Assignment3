Before changing its profile to fully focus on these aspects, it used to be a regular German public Gymnasium with a special separate school section ''(Spezialschulteil)'' attached to it. The school is named after the famous optician [[Carl Zeiss]] and is located in the city of [[Jena]] in Germany ''(federal state of [[Thuringia]])''. They accept students from all over the federal state.\n\n== Pupils ==\n\nCurrently there are about 500 students attending this school. But not all of those are enrolled in the special educational program. This program is restricted to [[highly gifted]] students. Hence, there are certain requirements for an individual to be able to obtain a place at this school, including qualification exams and other background checks like grades and awards accomplished by the prospective student mostly at the former school.\n\nIn the early phases of the school students got to go from 9th grade onto the special section of the school (usually two new groups [classes] accepted per year). The year before is severe because this is when the exams take place and the school decides about their new students for the upcoming year. Later on it was also possible for kids to attend the school from 5th grade on.\n\nHowever, students starting 5th grade also had to take an exam, which didn't guarantee that they would pass the exam for 9th grade because they had to take this exam as well as everybody else (albeit they have a slight advantage by having been educated longer on a higher level).\n\nAnyway, 5th grade students do not have the possibility to stay at the boarding school. The boarding school, established in 2000,<ref>{{Cite web | title =10 Years VACOM Internat of Carl Zeiss- Gymnasium Jena, 23 April 2010 | work =VACOM News - Company News | publisher =VACOM Vakuum Komponenten & Messtechnik GmbH | date =23 April 2010 | url =http://www.vacom-vacuum.com/1/1/firmenneuigkeiten.php | accessdate =8 November 2010 }}</ref> is separate and privately maintained. It offers a possibility for students from 9th (to 12th) grade to live close to the school. Fees for this boarding school are subsidized by the federal state. Even though this is a good opportunity there are very few places being offered.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Forming ===\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium formed after the [[German reunification]] by affiliating the ''Polytechnische Oberschule \"Clara Zetkin\"'' (polytechnic grammar school \"Clara Zetking\"), which was founded in 1963, and the ''Spezialschule mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlich-technischer Richtung \"Carl Zeiss\"'' (special school with mathematical and natural scientific orientation). This process first yielded a normal Gymnasium ''(Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium)'' and in addition a special section ''(Spezialschulteil)''. This particular part of the school has been accessible for students from 9th grade onwards. Since the educational system of federal state of [[Thuringia]] didn't provide to maintain a school as only being a ''Spezialschule'' (special school) it was necessary to connect it with a regular Gymnasium.\n\n=== Support ===\n\nThe '''Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena''' has especially been supported by the [[Carl-Zeiss company|Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung]] that is also located in [[Jena]]. During the times of the [[German Democratic Republic]] a lot of students were recruited by the company and found themselves becoming engineers or in leadership positions after their graduation. Programs during the school times helped the students to get an orientation for their later profession. Even today there is a more or less close connection between the school and the enterprise with the same name. For instance, funding for good achievements of students are often given out by the company to support the school.\n\n=== Equipment ===\n\nThe school often receives good funding by the federal state and is therefore very well-equipped compared to other Gymnasiums in the region. The technical sections of the school meet high standards and can be considered pretty modern in terms of education.\n\nThe special school section used to be in a separate building from the regular one. But after the main building got renovated in the years from 2003 to 2005 the special school moved in this building, too. After their abandoning the old building is now used by an elementary school.\n\n=== Perspective ===\n\nBy 2008 the school is supposed to be completely transformed into a mere ''Spezialschule'' (literal translation: special school) since this school has been running as a trial so far. Then the program will run for students officially from 5th grade on.\n\nThereby, the position of the ''\"Leiter der Spezialklassen\"'' (\"Guidance of the special classes\") would not be needed anymore because the leading of the school is currently separate. This office had been held for a long time by ''R\u00fcdiger Eisenbrand'' who quit his official school service. He is now mayor of the city of [[Apolda]]. If he will return to any office at the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is not sure yet.\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\n=== Syllabus and Appearance ===\n\nThe curriculum of the ''Spezialschule'' (special school) differs tremendously from those in regular Gymnasiums in [[Thuringia]]. The coverage is, as mentioned earlier above, mainly in the fields mathematics and natural science and goes very deep into the topics. Therefore, there is an abundance of classes related to these topics and lot of periods to be taken by the students. But since students are very into their subjects discussion in class are sometimes very intens and are appreciated with high interest by the students even if arguing sometimes runs riot. Classes are kept very small, often from 14-20 students maximum, and are also pretty often separated again (for certain scientific subjects) so that a group of 6-8 people yields a very good learning result.\n\nStudents learn informatics related subjects already in 10th and 9th grade, which is not usual.\n\n=== Projects ===\n\nIn 11th and 12th grade when the ''Kurssystem'' (course system) applies for the students they have to take [[mathematics]] as their major field of study. As the second major field of study they can choose between informatics (what is not usual offered), chemistry, biology or physics.\n\nThe ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper) - a big project work during 11th grade - has to be written about a mathematical or scientific topic only.\n\n9th grade students have to write their first project paper on a topic of their choice - the only restriction is that it has to be scientific. This is very unusual to start off already in this early grade with such a relatively big project.\n\nIt continues in 10th grade when students get to write the ''Informatikprojekt'' (informatics project) where students (mostly in small groups) have to write a program as well as a documentation paper in which they describe their problem sets, used solutions, algorithm, and problems that occurred on their way. At the end there is a presentation to be prepared and hold in front of a judging auditorium.\n\n=== Wahlobligatorischer Unterricht (selective compulsory curriculum) ===\n\nSince the curriculum of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is highly mathematical and scientifically oriented it offers advanced educational sessions for the student body. Starting from 9th grade every student gets to choose one deeper subject of study of his interest in the fields of math, physics, biology, chemistry or informatics. Now, two extra periods a week are dedicated to this particular field only. Unlike normal subject tutors of the ''wahlobligatorischer Unterricht'' do not proceed grading of students for those extra sessions. This often provides the opportunity for students as well as for teachers to take the matters of studies more airy and to deepen certain aspects of concern on behalf of special interest areas.\n\n=== Graduation ===\n\nThe [[Abitur|''Abitur'' (German high school diploma)]] can be taken in a slightly modified form in a so-called \"special version\" that has been fitted for a particular high requirement even though the German ''[[Abitur]]'' is compared to the diploma of the United States already pretty hard. But there is still the possibility to culminate the 'special school section' by taking the regular \"central Abitur\" for the federal state of [[Thuringia]].\n\n== Reputation ==\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is especially famous for the success of its students in several academic competitions on a national and an international level. Tournaments e. g. are the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], the ''Bundeswettbewerb Informatik'' (federal informatics contest), the [[International Chemistry Olympiad]] or the [[International Biology Olympiad]].\n\nOn some occasions the school also gets to host some of those competitions mentioned above.\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe [[University of Jena|Friedrich Schiller University of Jena (FSU)]] offers a possibility for the school to catch up with science just in their own town. Furthermore, a lot of students enjoy the opportunity of the convenience to visit professors and doctors of the numerous faculties of the university, which are scattered all over the town. Students can especially gain knowledge by getting help with their scientific projects and works assigned at school (bigger project like the ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper).\n\nA lot of students will take their chance and attain the university after they graduated from school and continue their studies in [[Jena]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cz-gymnasium.jena.de Homepage of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060918230836/http://internat.vacom.de/ Homepage of the boarding school]\n* [http://www.morgenpost.de/content/2007/01/21/biz/878071.html An article in the newspaper \"Berliner Morgenpost\" about the school (in German)]\n\n[[Category:Gymnasiums in Germany]]\n[[Category:Specialist schools in Germany]]\n[[Category:Schools in Thuringia]]\n[[Category:Education in Jena]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Jena]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1963]]\n[[Category:1963 establishments in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=November 2010}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n{{original research|date=September 2007}}\n{{Copy edit|date=March 2020}}\n{{Tone|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n{{Infobox school\n|name                   = Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena\n|native_name            =\n|latin_name             =\n|logo                   =\n|seal_image             =\n|image                  = Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena.jpg\n|image_size             =\n|alt                    =\n|caption                =\n|motto                  =\n|motto_translation      =\n|location               =\n|streetaddress          = Erich-Kuithan-Str. 7\n|region                 =\n|city                   = [[Jena]]\n|state                  = [[Thuringia]]\n|province               =\n|county                 =\n|postcode               =\n|postalcode             =\n|zipcode                =\n|country                = Germany\n|country1               =\n|coordinates            = {{Coord|50|57|08|N|11|36|33|E|region:DE_type:edu_source:dewiki|display=inline,title}}\n|schooltype             =\n|fundingtype            =\n|type                   = German elite [[Gymnasium school|''Gymnasium'']] for maths, science, and technology\n|religious_affiliation  =\n|religion               =\n|denomination           =\n|patron                 =\n|established            = 1963\n|founded                =\n|opened                 =\n|founder                =\n|status                 =\n|closed                 =\n|locale                 =\n|schoolboard            =\n|district               =\n|LEA                    =\n|authority              =\n|category               =\n|category_label         =\n|oversight              =\n|oversight_label        =\n|authorizer             =\n|superintendent         =\n|trustee                =\n|specialist             =\n|session                =\n|schoolnumber           =\n|school code            =\n|MOE                    =\n|ofsted                 =\n|ceeb                   =\n|president              =\n|chair                  =\n|chairman               =\n|chairperson            =\n|dean                   =\n|administrator          =\n|rector                 =\n|director               =\n|principal              = Dr. Carsten M\u00fcller\n|principal_label        =\n|principal1             =\n|principal2             =\n|principal3             =\n|principal4             =\n|viceprincipal          =\n|viceprincipal_label    =\n|viceprincipal1         =\n|viceprincipal2         =\n|viceprincipal3         =\n|viceprincipal4         =\n|asst principal         =\n|assistant_principals   =\n|campus director        =\n|headmistress           =\n|headmaster             =\n|head of school         =\n|head_teacher           =\n|executive_headteacher  =\n|acting_headteacher     =\n|head                   =\n|head_label             =\n|chaplain               =\n|custodian              =\n|staff                  =\n|faculty                =\n|teaching_staff         =\n|employees              =\n|key_people             =\n|grades                 =\n|years                  =\n|gender                 = [[Coeducational]]\n|lower_age              =\n|upper_age              =\n|age range              =\n|enrollment              = ca. 500\n|website                = {{URL|http://carl-zeiss-gymnasium.de/}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena''' is a state-funded German elite [[Gymnasium school|Gymnasium]] ''(grammar school)'' for highly gifted students in the fields of math, science, and technology.

This is very unusual to start off already in this early grade with such a relatively big project.\n\nIt continues in 10th grade when students get to write the ''Informatikprojekt'' (informatics project) where students (mostly in small groups) have to write a program as well as a documentation paper in which they describe their problem sets, used solutions, algorithm, and problems that occurred on their way. At the end there is a presentation to be prepared and hold in front of a judging auditorium.\n\n=== Wahlobligatorischer Unterricht (selective compulsory curriculum) ===\n\nSince the curriculum of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is highly mathematical and scientifically oriented it offers advanced educational sessions for the student body. Starting from 9th grade every student gets to choose one deeper subject of study of his interest in the fields of math, physics, biology, chemistry or informatics. Now, two extra periods a week are dedicated to this particular field only. Unlike normal subject tutors of the ''wahlobligatorischer Unterricht'' do not proceed grading of students for those extra sessions. This often provides the opportunity for students as well as for teachers to take the matters of studies more airy and to deepen certain aspects of concern on behalf of special interest areas.\n\n=== Graduation ===\n\nThe [[Abitur|''Abitur'' (German high school diploma)]] can be taken in a slightly modified form in a so-called \"special version\" that has been fitted for a particular high requirement even though the German ''[[Abitur]]'' is compared to the diploma of the United States already pretty hard. But there is still the possibility to culminate the 'special school section' by taking the regular \"central Abitur\" for the federal state of [[Thuringia]].\n\n== Reputation ==\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is especially famous for the success of its students in several academic competitions on a national and an international level. Tournaments e. g. are the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], the ''Bundeswettbewerb Informatik'' (federal informatics contest), the [[International Chemistry Olympiad]] or the [[International Biology Olympiad]].\n\nOn some occasions the school also gets to host some of those competitions mentioned above.\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe [[University of Jena|Friedrich Schiller University of Jena (FSU)]] offers a possibility for the school to catch up with science just in their own town. Furthermore, a lot of students enjoy the opportunity of the convenience to visit professors and doctors of the numerous faculties of the university, which are scattered all over the town. Students can especially gain knowledge by getting help with their scientific projects and works assigned at school (bigger project like the ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper).\n\nA lot of students will take their chance and attain the university after they graduated from school and continue their studies in [[Jena]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cz-gymnasium.jena.de Homepage of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060918230836/http://internat.vacom.de/ Homepage of the boarding school]\n* [http://www.morgenpost.de/content/2007/01/21/biz/878071.html An article in the newspaper \"Berliner Morgenpost\" about the school (in German)]\n\n[[Category:Gymnasiums in Germany]]\n[[Category:Specialist schools in Germany]]\n[[Category:Schools in Thuringia]]\n[[Category:Education in Jena]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Jena]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1963]]\n[[Category:1963 establishments in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Samaniran", "label": "safe", "comment": "Copy editing", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium_Jena"}
