As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining the illusion of a shared design, the British design departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 to such a degree that it was effectively a new design.<ref name=\"thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk\">http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/jaguar/history.php</ref>\n\nA separate partnership was formed between [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Turbomeca]] to develop the [[Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour|Adour]] afterburning turbofan engine.<ref name=\"JAWA80 p105\">Taylor 1980, p. 105.</ref><ref name=\"JAWA80 p708\">Taylor 1980, p. 708.</ref> The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca's Tourmalet engine for ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR RB.172 and their [[joint venture]] would use elements of both. The new engine, which would be used for the AFVG as well, would be built in Derby and Tarnos.<ref>Bowman 2007. pp. 18\u201319.</ref> Previous collaborative efforts between Britain and France had been complicated \u2013 the [[BAC/Dassault AFVG]] programme had ended in cancellation, while controversy surrounded the development of the supersonic airliner [[Concorde]].<ref name = 'wallace 27'>Wallace 1984, p. 27.</ref>\n\nEarly on, collaboration between BAC and Breguet went well;<ref name=\"WAPJ11 p58\">Jackson 1992, p. 58.</ref> however, following Dassault's takeover of Breguet in 1971, the firm encouraged acceptance of its own designs, such as the [[Dassault-Breguet Super \u00c9tendard|Super \u00c9tendard]] naval attack aircraft and the [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F1]], for which it would receive more workshare and profit, over the Jaguar.<ref name = 'wallace 27'/><ref name=\"WAPJ11 p77\">Jackson 1992, p. 77.</ref> Specifically, Dassault claimed that the Super \u00c9tendard was simpler and cheaper than the Jaguar, successfully persuading the French Navy to order it instead of the marinised Jaguar M, leading to the variant's cancellation in 1973.<ref name=\"WAPJ11 p77\"/><ref>Bowman 2007, p. 26.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the type's adoption by France and the United Kingdom, the Jaguar was successfully exported abroad as well. As early as 1968, [[India]] had been approached as a possible customer for the Jaguar, but had declined, partly on the grounds that it was not yet clear if the French and British would themselves accept the aircraft into service.<ref>Cohen and Dasgupta 2010, p. 77.</ref> India had already developed the indigenously [[HAL Marut|Marut]] fighter-bomber, and was at one point keen to upgrade the type, until such efforts failed. The [[Indian Air Force]] (IAF) became the largest single export customer of the Jagaur, placing a $1 billion order for the aircraft in 1978, the Jaguar being chosen ahead of competitors such as the Dassault Mirage F1 and the [[Saab Viggen]] after a long and difficult evaluation process.<ref name = 'Barua 274'>Barua 2005, p. 274.</ref><ref name=\"AI Oct88 p177-181\">''Air International'' October 1988, pp. 177\u2013181.</ref> The order involved 40 Jaguars built in Europe at [[Warton Aerodrome|Warton]], and 120 [[licence-built]] aircraft from [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] (HAL) under the local name ''[[Shamshir|Shamsher]]'' (\"Sword of Justice\").<ref name = 'Barua 274'/><ref name=\"Eden p.400-1\">Eden 2004, pp. 400\u2013401.</ref>\n\n<!-- ==See also== -->\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Barua, Pradeep.
