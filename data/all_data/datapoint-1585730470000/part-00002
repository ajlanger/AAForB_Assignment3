Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006 Pp. 79.</ref> However the Italian government changed its positions on the border throughout April, later supporting the annexation of Ohrid while giving the territory lying directly outside of Ohrid (including the sacred birthplace of [[Clement of Ohrid|Saint Clement]]) to the Slavic Macedonians.<ref name=\"Davide Rodogno Pp. 79\"/> After a period of negotiations Italy's new Balkan borders \u2013 including Albania's new borders, were declared by royal decree on 7 June 1941.<ref name=\"Davide Rodogno Pp. 79\"/>\n\nAfter the [[Armistice with Italy|Italian capitulation]] in September 1943, the country was [[Albania under Germany|occupied by the Germans]] until the end of the war.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Map of Albania during WWII.png|thumbnail|Albania during World War II]]\nUpon the occupation of Albania and installation of a new government, the economies of Albania and Italy were connected through a [[customs union]] that resulted in the removal of most trade restrictions.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005. Pp. 102\"/> Through a [[tariff]] union, the Italian tariff system was put in place in Albania.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005. Pp. 102\"/> Due to the expected economic losses in Albania from the alteration in tariff policy, the Italian government provided Albania 15 million [[Albanian lek]]s each year in compensation.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005. Pp. 102\"/> Italian customs laws were to apply in Albania and only Italy alone could conclude treaties with third parties.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005. Pp. 102\"/> Italian capital was allowed to dominate the Albanian economy.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005. Pp. 102\"/> As a result, Italian companies were allowed to hold monopolies in the exploitation of Albanian natural resources.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005. Pp. 102\"/>\n\nIn 1944, the number of companies and industrial enterprises reached 430, from just 244 in 1938 and only 71 such in 1922. The degree of concentration of workers in industrial production in 1938 doubled compared with 1928. At this time, Albania's economy had trade relations with 21 countries, but most developed were first to Italy and then to Yugoslavia, France, Germany, Greece, etc.\n\nThe country entered capitalist economic development much later than other European countries. Despite the presence of some foreign (mainly Italian) investment, Albania had made little move towards industrial development at the onset of World War II. Agriculture, which employed over 87% of the workforce, was the main sector of the economy and contributed 92.4% of the national income, with main outputs being wheat, maize and rye. Agriculture used primitive tools such as wood ploughs, whilst fertilisers were hardly known at all, and drainage poor. The level of productivity and level of organization and mechanization of agriculture in this period were very low.\n\n==Administrative division==\nThe Italians adopted the existing Albanian system of prefectures ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''prefetture''). In line with the administrative structure of the rest of Italy these were also called provinces (Italian: ''provincia''). However, unlike Italy the Albanian sub-prefecture (Italian: ''sotto prefetture'') was retained. There were initially 10 prefectures.<ref>Great Britain, War Office; Italy OR 5301 (1943)</ref><ref>Great Britain, War Office; Albania OR 5824 (1943)</ref> Under this was 30 sub-prefectures and 23 municipalities (Italian: ''municipalit\u00e0'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.com.al/2014/04/22/historia-e-ndarjes-administrative-nga-ismail-qemali-ne-92/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029135311/http://www.panorama.com.al/2014/04/22/historia-e-ndarjes-administrative-nga-ismail-qemali-ne-92/ |archivedate=29 October 2014 }}</ref> Each Prefecture was run by a Prefect located in the city of the same name.

[[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] was proclaimed king of Albania, creating a [[personal union]] with Italy; he was represented in Tirana by a [[viceroy]]. A customs union was created, and Rome took over Albanian foreign policy. The Albanian armed forces were subsumed into the Italian military, Italian advisers were placed inside all levels of the Albanian administration, and the country was fascisticized with the establishment of an [[Albanian Fascist Party]] and its attendant organizations, modelled after the Italian prototype. The Albanian Fascist Party was a branch of the National Fascist Party of Italy, members of the Albanian Fascist Party took an oath to obey the orders of the Duce of Fascism, Mussolini.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005.

Later, during the [[High Middle Ages]] some coastal areas (like [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]]) had been influenced and owned by Italian powers, chiefly the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Republic of Venice]] for many years (cf. [[Albania Veneta]]).

Mussolini planned to invade Greece and other countries like [[Yugoslavia]] in the area to give Italy territorial control of most of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coastline, as part of the Fascists' objective of creating the objective of ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' (\"Our Sea\") in which Italy would dominate the Mediterranean. But the Albanian army under the command of colonel (later general) Prenk Pervizi<ref>Pieter Hidri, General Prenk Pervizi, Tirana, Toena, 2002.</ref> abandoned the Italians in combat, causing a major unraveling of their lines. The Albanian army believed to be the cause of the betrayal was removed from the front. The Colonel Pervizi and his staff of officials was isolated in the mountains of Puka and Shkodra to the North.<ref>''Julian Amery, The sons of the Eagle, London, 1946, s. 302\u2013306''</ref> This was the first action of revolt against the Italian occupation.\n\n[[File:1940 Albanian Kingdom Laissez Passer issued for traveling to Fascist Italy after the invasion of 1939.jpg|thumb|1940 Albanian Kingdom Laissez Passer issued for traveling to Italy after the invasion of 1939]]\n\nBut, soon after the Italian invasion, the Greeks counter-attacked and a sizable portion of Albania was in Greek hands (including the cities of [[Gjirokast\u00ebr]] and [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]]). In April 1941, Greece capitulated after an overwhelming [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]]. All of Albania returned to Italian control, which was also extended to most of Greece, which was [[Axis Occupation of Greece|jointly occupied]] by Italy, Germany and Bulgaria. Italian plans however to annex Chameria to Albania were shelved due strong opposition and ethnic conflict between Albanians and Greeks, as well as opposition by [[Aromanians]] to the region being Albanianized.<ref name=Ro108>{{cite book|last=Rodogno. |first=Davide |title=Fascism's European empire: Italian occupation during the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcUNELPsQQsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fascism%27s+European+empire:+Italian+occupation+during+the+Second+World+War&hl=en&ei=dig_TPn6OYKC8gaGlcDpCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-84515-7|page=108}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of Yugoslavia and Greece in April 1941, the Italian government began negotiations with Germany, Bulgaria, and the newly established client state, the [[Independent State of Croatia]], on defining their borders. In April Mussolini called for the borders of Albania to be expanded \u2013 including annexing [[Montenegro]] into Albania that would have an autonomous government within Albania, and expanding Albania's border eastwards, though not as far as the Vardar river as some had proposed \u2013 citing that [[Ohrid]]  should be left to the Slavic Macedonians, regardless of whether [[Vardar Macedonia]] would become an independent state or be annexed by Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Davide Rodogno Pp. 79\">Davide Rodogno.

Pp. 102\"/> Through a [[tariff]] union, the Italian tariff system was put in place in Albania.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005.

The degree of concentration of workers in industrial production in 1938 doubled compared with 1928. At this time, Albania's economy had trade relations with 21 countries, but most developed were first to Italy and then to Yugoslavia, France, Germany, Greece, etc.\n\nThe country entered capitalist economic development much later than other European countries. Despite the presence of some foreign (mainly Italian) investment, Albania had made little move towards industrial development at the onset of World War II. Agriculture, which employed over 87% of the workforce, was the main sector of the economy and contributed 92.4% of the national income, with main outputs being wheat, maize and rye. Agriculture used primitive tools such as wood ploughs, whilst fertilisers were hardly known at all, and drainage poor. The level of productivity and level of organization and mechanization of agriculture in this period were very low.\n\n==Administrative division==\nThe Italians adopted the existing Albanian system of prefectures ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''prefetture''). In line with the administrative structure of the rest of Italy these were also called provinces (Italian: ''provincia''). However, unlike Italy the Albanian sub-prefecture (Italian: ''sotto prefetture'') was retained. There were initially 10 prefectures.<ref>Great Britain, War Office; Italy OR 5301 (1943)</ref><ref>Great Britain, War Office; Albania OR 5824 (1943)</ref> Under this was 30 sub-prefectures and 23 municipalities (Italian: ''municipalit\u00e0'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.com.al/2014/04/22/historia-e-ndarjes-administrative-nga-ismail-qemali-ne-92/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029135311/http://www.panorama.com.al/2014/04/22/historia-e-ndarjes-administrative-nga-ismail-qemali-ne-92/ |archivedate=29 October 2014 }}</ref> Each Prefecture was run by a Prefect located in the city of the same name.
