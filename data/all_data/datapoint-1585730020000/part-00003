India is the last country with both lions and tigers in the wild. Historically, the modern lion and tiger co-occupied a vast portion of [[Eurasia]],<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/> from India in the east, through northern [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], to the shores of the [[Black Sea]] in the west.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/>]]\n\nHistorically, a comparison of the [[tiger]] (''Panthera tigris'') versus the [[lion]] (''Panthera leo'')<ref name=Geptner /><ref name=CAP /> has been a popular topic of discussion by [[hunter]]s,<ref name=Ortega2007 /><ref name=\"Porter1894\" /> naturalists,<ref name=\"TOTW2010\" /> artists, and poets, and continues to inspire the popular imagination.<ref name=\"Thespokesmanreview1959\" /><ref name=lat /><ref name=Thomas2006 /><ref name=\"PapersPast1900\" /> In the past, lions and tigers reportedly [[#Competition or coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness|competed in the wilderness]],<ref name=minn /><ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\" /> where their ranges overlapped in [[Eurasia]].<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Humphreys1999 /> The most common reported circumstance of their meeting is in [[Captive animal|captivity]],<ref name=\"Beatty1941\" /> either deliberately<ref name=lat/><ref name=\"Auguet1994\" /> or accidentally.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"newspaperarchive.com\" />\n\n== Physical and behavioral comparison ==\n\n=== Behavioral comparison ===\nBoth the lion and the tiger have fearsome reputations in their native areas in relation to prey, [[sympatric]] predators, and people. Both may [[Man-eater|prey on humans]], though rates of man-eating tend to be higher for the [[Tiger attack|tiger]].<ref name=\"Porter1894\"/><ref name=\"BCKM1993\"/> \n\nGeneral differences in behavior:\n\n* The lion is usually a [[social animal]], while the tiger is [[Solitary animal|solitary]]. For this reason, even if tigers had individual advantages over lions, such as in intelligence, lions often killed tigers in captivity by ganging up on them, whereas tigers tended not to form fighting gangs.<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\" />\n* Lions roam in prides of up to 30 individuals headed by a mature male or group of related males, until an incumbent male is killed or driven away by a new male leader. The majority of single roaming lions tend to be males preparing for maturation and assimilation with a new or existing pride. While male lions are generally larger and stronger than female lions, it is the close-knit female pride alliance that typically hunts and provides for the pride. By contrast, tigers are often solitary,<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\"/> though they do socialize.<ref name=CAP/> During a mating tryst, a tiger and tigress are hostile to other creatures, with the same applying to lions.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\nMore specifically, however, the Asiatic lion has similarities and differences with both its African relative and the tiger. For example, Asiatic lions are social like their African relatives, and females may be [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]].<ref name=Schaller1972/> However, the structures of the prides of African and Asiatic lions vary,<ref name=S&S02/> with male Asiatic lions usually associating with females during times of mating,<ref name=\"Joslin1973\" /><ref name=\"Meena2008\" /> similar to tigers,<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Pocock1939/> and whereas Asiatic lionesses and tigresses may practice promiscuity in order to defend their [[Cub (organism)|cub]]s, African lionesses are believed not to do it for that purpose.<ref name=\"HT2016\" />\n\n== Coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness ==\nCurrently, India is the only country confirmed to have both wild lions and tigers, specifically [[Asiatic lion]]s and [[Bengal tiger]]s.<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Partington1835 /><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997 /> Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past,<ref name=minn/><ref name=ToT1838/><ref name=Pocock1939 /><ref name=Karanth03 /> and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild.<ref name=\"cambridge\" /><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\" />\n\nBefore the end of the 20th century, Asiatic lions<ref name=Haas2005 /><ref name=Catsg /> and [[Caspian tiger]]s<ref name=Mazak1981 /><ref name=Luo04 /> had occurred in other [[Asia]]n<ref name=\"Tudge2011\" /> or Eurasian nations, including [[Iran]].<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997/><ref name=Pocock1939/> As such, there is a word for 'Lion',<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Catsg/> which can also mean 'Tiger',<ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Kipling /> and is used in Iran, [[South Asia]] and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}}}}),<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\" /> and its significance is discussed below.\n\nAccording to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large [[herbivore]]s, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia. Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers on an individual basis, as they would with each other.<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/>\n\nApart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring, which would be [[liger]]s or [[tigon]]s.<ref name=messybeast2012 /><ref name=\"ligerfacts.org\" /><ref name=\"krypto\" /><ref name=\"lair\" /><ref name=shi /> From the [[fossil]] record, besides [[genetics]],<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Luo04/><ref name=\"KitchenerDugmore2000\" /> it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the [[Pleistocene]], when now-extinct relatives also existed there.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Haas2005/><ref name=Mazak1981/> Additionally, in the days before [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]], the [[Maharaja of Gwalior]] introduced African lions into [[Gwalior|his area]], which is a habitat for Bengal tigers.<ref name=\"Jhaletal2011\" />\n\n[[File:Asiatic Lion Gir Forest.jpg|left|thumb|An Asiatic lion in [[Gir Forest]], [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]]' [[ecoregion]], India]]\n[[File:Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (3619932614).jpg|right|thumb|T-12 the Bengal tiger in [[Ranthambore National Park]], Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests' ecoregion, India]]\nThe possibility of conflict between lions and tigers had been raised in relation to India's [[Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project]], which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the Asiatic lion, that is [[Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Madhya Pradesh,<ref name=\"cambridge\"/> before December 2017.<ref name=\"HT 2017\" /><ref name=\"TOI 12-2017\" /> Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\"/> Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would \"trigger frequent clashes.\"<ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2006\" /> The [[University of Minnesota]]'s Lion Research Project describes one reason to delay the introduction of lions to Kuno Palpur, is the fear that tigers living there would kill the incoming lions. In a one-on-one encounter, it is believed that a Bengal tiger could beat an Indian lion, given its weight advantage.<ref name=minn/> Despite the fact that the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favor solitary hunters of prey,<ref name=Kailash1978/> these lions are social like their African relatives,<ref name=S&S02 /> and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary. The american biologist [[Craig Packer]] considers that a group of lions (two to three males) or lionesses (two to four females) is more than a match for a single tiger or tigress. Craig Packer is of the opinion that, in order for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be translocated there as intact groups rather than as individuals.<ref name=minn/>\n\n[[Reginald Innes Pocock]] (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Indian Subcontinent before lions. The tigers likely entered [[Northern India]] from the eastern end of the [[Himalayas]], through [[Burma]], and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from [[Balochistan]] or [[Persia]], and spread to places like the Bengal and the [[Nerbudda River]]. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it,<ref name=Pocock1939/> as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Mazak1981/><ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Karanth03/> As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\n== Observed fights ==\n[[File:Indischer Maler um 1650 (II) 001.jpg|thumb|A [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] painting of a [[Dervish]] with a lion and tiger]]\n\nIn the [[circus (building)|circuses]] of [[Ancient Rome]], exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other,<ref name=\"Auguet1994\"/> including [[Barbary lion]]s<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Beinglion2005-2014 /><ref name=Petermaas2000-2011 /> and tigers.<ref name=Hoage8-18 /> A [[mosaic]] in the [[House of the Faun]] in [[Pompeii]] shows a fight between a lion and a tiger.<ref name=\"King2002\" /> There are different accounts of which of these [[animal]]s gained the victory.

The two animals were found fighting each other, in which the keepers made fruitless efforts to part the two animals. Towards the end of the fight, the lion gained a brief advantage, at which point the tiger, while on his back, with swift strikes and using his back legs, tore open the lion's stomach.

The tiger was more than {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=off}} long, over {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=off}} feet at the shoulder, had strong shoulders and long teeth and claws, and was agile. The lion looked taller at the head than the tiger, and had a large mane, legs and paws.

The Gaekwad agreed to pay 37,000 [[rupee]]s, accepted that the tiger was the \"King of the [[Cat Family]],\" decreed that Atlas' body be given a Royal burial, and that the tiger should have a \"cage of honour\" in the [[menagerie]] of [[Baroda]], and decided to prepare the tiger for a battle with a Sierran [[grizzly bear]] weighing more than {{convert|1500|lb|kg|abbr=in}}.

Pursuing it, they caught a glimpse of it, but by that time, the tiger had attacked a local. It disappeared with the victim, and after pursuing it for about {{convert|50.0|yard|ft|abbr=on}}, they heard the roar of a lion, and besides it, sounds which suggested that it was in a struggle with the tiger, such as growls. The party not only managed to see the lion and tiger rolling about in their battle, after going through bushes, but also the man who fell victim to the tiger. The author termed both the lion and tiger as \"tyrants of the [[forest]],\" given that they would attack weaker creatures. The tiger was about the same size as the lion, but more agile. As for the lion, it used greater strength, and its mane, which was somewhat deeper than those of its bigger African cousins, could protect its head from the tiger's claws, though not other parts of its body, such as the back. They were as determined and brave as each other, but the lion endured. It caught the tiger's [[throat]], turned it on its back, and killed it by clawing its abdomen open. The lion was thus hailed as the \"King of Beasts.\" Otherwise, the fight had been harsh for both beasts, to the extent that the author felt that it would avenge their victims.<ref name=\"CUL1855\" />\n* ''[[The Sun (New York)]]'' reported that in a [[Population decline|depopulated]] Indian village at the bank of a [[Creek (stream)|creek]] connected to the [[Cauvery River]], about {{convert|30.0|mile|km|abbr=on}} [[Bayalu Seeme|north-west]] of [[Bangalore]], a hunter injured by a [[venom]]ous creature saw a tiger on his left-hand side, and a lion on his right-hand side. The tiger was a \"rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life,\" and had muscular limbs. The male lion was \"medium-sized.\" Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first, as they were separated by a wall that was about {{convert|4.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} tall, and their focus was on the witness. When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry [[cat]], which included making a noise that startled the latter. The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe. After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it. Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary,<ref name=Schaller1967 /> but that was not the case with this struggle. Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall. After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured. Still, they were determined to destroy each other. The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled. The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him. The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again, and struggling to its feet like it. The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its fore shoulder, before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck. Now the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it. Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like [[Dog fighting|that of dogs]] unable to beat each other. They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek. They fell into the water, which was about {{convert|2.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} deep, and this stopped the fight. They retreated from each other, [[limp]]ing into the [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests|forest]].{{efn|As reported by ''St. Landry Democrat'' (1887),<ref name=\"StLandryDemocrat1887\"/> ''The Eaton Democrat'' (1887),<ref name=\"EatonDemocrat1887\"/> ''The Iola Register'' (1887),<ref name=\"IolaRegister1887\"/> ''The Milan Exchange'' (1887),<ref name=\"MilanExchange1887\"/> and ''[[The Sydney Mail]]'' (1889),<ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\"/> in [[chronological order]].}}\n* Rivalry between the Asiatic lion and \"[[Siberia]]n tiger\"{{efn|Though this term was used,<ref name=\"SanFranciscoCall1911\" /> genetic tests showed that the [[Siberian tiger]] was closely related to the [[Caspian tiger]],<ref name=\"CSG2017\" /><ref name=\"Driscolletal2009\" /> which also inhabited the former [[Soviet Union]] (where Siberia is located), and whose range would have overlapped with that of the lion in places like the Caucasus.<ref name=\"Geptner\" />}} is mentioned in Hamilton M.

Historically, the modern lion and tiger co-occupied a vast portion of [[Eurasia]],<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/> from India in the east, through northern [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], to the shores of the [[Black Sea]] in the west.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/>]]\n\nHistorically, a comparison of the [[tiger]] (''Panthera tigris'') versus the [[lion]] (''Panthera leo'')<ref name=Geptner /><ref name=CAP /> has been a popular topic of discussion by [[hunter]]s,<ref name=Ortega2007 /><ref name=\"Porter1894\" /> naturalists,<ref name=\"TOTW2010\" /> artists, and poets, and continues to inspire the popular imagination.<ref name=\"Thespokesmanreview1959\" /><ref name=lat /><ref name=Thomas2006 /><ref name=\"PapersPast1900\" /> In the past, lions and tigers reportedly [[#Competition or coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness|competed in the wilderness]],<ref name=minn /><ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\" /> where their ranges overlapped in [[Eurasia]].<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Humphreys1999 /> The most common reported circumstance of their meeting is in [[Captive animal|captivity]],<ref name=\"Beatty1941\" /> either deliberately<ref name=lat/><ref name=\"Auguet1994\" /> or accidentally.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"newspaperarchive.com\" />\n\n== Physical and behavioral comparison ==\n\n=== Behavioral comparison ===\nBoth the lion and the tiger have fearsome reputations in their native areas in relation to prey, [[sympatric]] predators, and people. Both may [[Man-eater|prey on humans]], though rates of man-eating tend to be higher for the [[Tiger attack|tiger]].<ref name=\"Porter1894\"/><ref name=\"BCKM1993\"/> \n\nGeneral differences in behavior:\n\n* The lion is usually a [[social animal]], while the tiger is [[Solitary animal|solitary]]. For this reason, even if tigers had individual advantages over lions, such as in intelligence, lions often killed tigers in captivity by ganging up on them, whereas tigers tended not to form fighting gangs.<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\" />\n* Lions roam in prides of up to 30 individuals headed by a mature male or group of related males, until an incumbent male is killed or driven away by a new male leader. The majority of single roaming lions tend to be males preparing for maturation and assimilation with a new or existing pride. While male lions are generally larger and stronger than female lions, it is the close-knit female pride alliance that typically hunts and provides for the pride. By contrast, tigers are often solitary,<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\"/> though they do socialize.<ref name=CAP/> During a mating tryst, a tiger and tigress are hostile to other creatures, with the same applying to lions.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\nMore specifically, however, the Asiatic lion has similarities and differences with both its African relative and the tiger. For example, Asiatic lions are social like their African relatives, and females may be [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]].<ref name=Schaller1972/> However, the structures of the prides of African and Asiatic lions vary,<ref name=S&S02/> with male Asiatic lions usually associating with females during times of mating,<ref name=\"Joslin1973\" /><ref name=\"Meena2008\" /> similar to tigers,<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Pocock1939/> and whereas Asiatic lionesses and tigresses may practice promiscuity in order to defend their [[Cub (organism)|cub]]s, African lionesses are believed not to do it for that purpose.<ref name=\"HT2016\" />\n\n== Coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness ==\nCurrently, India is the only country confirmed to have both wild lions and tigers, specifically [[Asiatic lion]]s and [[Bengal tiger]]s.<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Partington1835 /><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997 /> Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past,<ref name=minn/><ref name=ToT1838/><ref name=Pocock1939 /><ref name=Karanth03 /> and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild.<ref name=\"cambridge\" /><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\" />\n\nBefore the end of the 20th century, Asiatic lions<ref name=Haas2005 /><ref name=Catsg /> and [[Caspian tiger]]s<ref name=Mazak1981 /><ref name=Luo04 /> had occurred in other [[Asia]]n<ref name=\"Tudge2011\" /> or Eurasian nations, including [[Iran]].<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997/><ref name=Pocock1939/> As such, there is a word for 'Lion',<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Catsg/> which can also mean 'Tiger',<ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Kipling /> and is used in Iran, [[South Asia]] and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}}}}),<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\" /> and its significance is discussed below.\n\nAccording to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large [[herbivore]]s, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia. Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers on an individual basis, as they would with each other.<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/>\n\nApart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring, which would be [[liger]]s or [[tigon]]s.<ref name=messybeast2012 /><ref name=\"ligerfacts.org\" /><ref name=\"krypto\" /><ref name=\"lair\" /><ref name=shi /> From the [[fossil]] record, besides [[genetics]],<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Luo04/><ref name=\"KitchenerDugmore2000\" /> it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the [[Pleistocene]], when now-extinct relatives also existed there.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Haas2005/><ref name=Mazak1981/> Additionally, in the days before [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]], the [[Maharaja of Gwalior]] introduced African lions into [[Gwalior|his area]], which is a habitat for Bengal tigers.<ref name=\"Jhaletal2011\" />\n\n[[File:Asiatic Lion Gir Forest.jpg|left|thumb|An Asiatic lion in [[Gir Forest]], [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]]' [[ecoregion]], India]]\n[[File:Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (3619932614).jpg|right|thumb|T-12 the Bengal tiger in [[Ranthambore National Park]], Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests' ecoregion, India]]\nThe possibility of conflict between lions and tigers had been raised in relation to India's [[Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project]], which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the Asiatic lion, that is [[Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Madhya Pradesh,<ref name=\"cambridge\"/> before December 2017.<ref name=\"HT 2017\" /><ref name=\"TOI 12-2017\" /> Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\"/> Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would \"trigger frequent clashes.\"<ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2006\" /> The [[University of Minnesota]]'s Lion Research Project describes one reason to delay the introduction of lions to Kuno Palpur, is the fear that tigers living there would kill the incoming lions. In a one-on-one encounter, it is believed that a Bengal tiger could beat an Indian lion, given its weight advantage.<ref name=minn/> Despite the fact that the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favor solitary hunters of prey,<ref name=Kailash1978/> these lions are social like their African relatives,<ref name=S&S02 /> and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary. The american biologist [[Craig Packer]] considers that a group of lions (two to three males) or lionesses (two to four females) is more than a match for a single tiger or tigress. Craig Packer is of the opinion that, in order for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be translocated there as intact groups rather than as individuals.<ref name=minn/>\n\n[[Reginald Innes Pocock]] (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Indian Subcontinent before lions. The tigers likely entered [[Northern India]] from the eastern end of the [[Himalayas]], through [[Burma]], and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from [[Balochistan]] or [[Persia]], and spread to places like the Bengal and the [[Nerbudda River]]. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it,<ref name=Pocock1939/> as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Mazak1981/><ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Karanth03/> As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\n== Observed fights ==\n[[File:Indischer Maler um 1650 (II) 001.jpg|thumb|A [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] painting of a [[Dervish]] with a lion and tiger]]\n\nIn the [[circus (building)|circuses]] of [[Ancient Rome]], exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other,<ref name=\"Auguet1994\"/> including [[Barbary lion]]s<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Beinglion2005-2014 /><ref name=Petermaas2000-2011 /> and tigers.<ref name=Hoage8-18 /> A [[mosaic]] in the [[House of the Faun]] in [[Pompeii]] shows a fight between a lion and a tiger.<ref name=\"King2002\" /> There are different accounts of which of these [[animal]]s gained the victory.

The two animals were found fighting each other, in which the keepers made fruitless efforts to part the two animals. Towards the end of the fight, the lion gained a brief advantage, at which point the tiger, while on his back, with swift strikes and using his back legs, tore open the lion's stomach.

The tiger was more than {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=off}} long, over {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=off}} feet at the shoulder, had strong shoulders and long teeth and claws, and was agile.

The Gaekwad agreed to pay 37,000 [[rupee]]s, accepted that the tiger was the \"King of the [[Cat Family]],\" decreed that Atlas' body be given a Royal burial, and that the tiger should have a \"cage of honour\" in the [[menagerie]] of [[Baroda]], and decided to prepare the tiger for a battle with a Sierran [[grizzly bear]] weighing more than {{convert|1500|lb|kg|abbr=in}}.

Pursuing it, they caught a glimpse of it, but by that time, the tiger had attacked a local. It disappeared with the victim, and after pursuing it for about {{convert|50.0|yard|ft|abbr=on}}, they heard the roar of a lion, and besides it, sounds which suggested that it was in a struggle with the tiger, such as growls. The party not only managed to see the lion and tiger rolling about in their battle, after going through bushes, but also the man who fell victim to the tiger. The author termed both the lion and tiger as \"tyrants of the [[forest]],\" given that they would attack weaker creatures. The tiger was about the same size as the lion, but more agile. As for the lion, it used greater strength, and its mane, which was somewhat deeper than those of its bigger African cousins, could protect its head from the tiger's claws, though not other parts of its body, such as the back. They were as determined and brave as each other, but the lion endured. It caught the tiger's [[throat]], turned it on its back, and killed it by clawing its abdomen open. The lion was thus hailed as the \"King of Beasts.\" Otherwise, the fight had been harsh for both beasts, to the extent that the author felt that it would avenge their victims.<ref name=\"CUL1855\" />\n* ''[[The Sun (New York)]]'' reported that in a [[Population decline|depopulated]] Indian village at the bank of a [[Creek (stream)|creek]] connected to the [[Cauvery River]], about {{convert|30.0|mile|km|abbr=on}} [[Bayalu Seeme|north-west]] of [[Bangalore]], a hunter injured by a [[venom]]ous creature saw a tiger on his left-hand side, and a lion on his right-hand side. The tiger was a \"rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life,\" and had muscular limbs. The male lion was \"medium-sized.\" Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first, as they were separated by a wall that was about {{convert|4.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} tall, and their focus was on the witness. When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry [[cat]], which included making a noise that startled the latter. The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe. After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it. Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary,<ref name=Schaller1967 /> but that was not the case with this struggle. Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall. After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured. Still, they were determined to destroy each other. The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled. The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him. The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again, and struggling to its feet like it. The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its fore shoulder, before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck. Now the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it. Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like [[Dog fighting|that of dogs]] unable to beat each other. They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek. They fell into the water, which was about {{convert|2.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} deep, and this stopped the fight. They retreated from each other, [[limp]]ing into the [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests|forest]].{{efn|As reported by ''St. Landry Democrat'' (1887),<ref name=\"StLandryDemocrat1887\"/> ''The Eaton Democrat'' (1887),<ref name=\"EatonDemocrat1887\"/> ''The Iola Register'' (1887),<ref name=\"IolaRegister1887\"/> ''The Milan Exchange'' (1887),<ref name=\"MilanExchange1887\"/> and ''[[The Sydney Mail]]'' (1889),<ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\"/> in [[chronological order]].}}\n* Rivalry between the Asiatic lion and \"[[Siberia]]n tiger\"{{efn|Though this term was used,<ref name=\"SanFranciscoCall1911\" /> genetic tests showed that the [[Siberian tiger]] was closely related to the [[Caspian tiger]],<ref name=\"CSG2017\" /><ref name=\"Driscolletal2009\" /> which also inhabited the former [[Soviet Union]] (where Siberia is located), and whose range would have overlapped with that of the lion in places like the Caucasus.<ref name=\"Geptner\" />}} is mentioned in Hamilton M.
