The sect integrated the belief of [[Jesus]] as the [[Messiah in Judaism|prophesied Messiah]] and his teachings into the Jewish faith, including the observance of the [[Jewish law]]. Jewish Christianity is the foundation of [[Early Christianity]], which later developed into [[Christianity]]. Christianity started with [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish eschatological]] expectations, and it developed into the veneration of a deified [[Jesus]] after his earthly [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]], his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], and the post-crucifixion experiences of his followers.\n\nThe inclusion of [[gentile]]s led to a growing split between Jewish Christians and gentile Christianity. From the latter [[Great Church|\"orthodox\" Christianity]] eventually arose, while mainstream Judaism developed into [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Jewish Christians drifted apart from mainstream Judaism, eventually becoming a minority strand which had mostly disappeared by the fifth century.\n\nThe split of [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] took place during the [[Early Christianity|first centuries CE]].<ref name=\"Shiffman\">{{cite web |url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/how-jewish-christians-became-christians/ |title=How Jewish Christians Became Christians |last=Shiffman |first=Lawrence H. |date=2018 |website=My Jewish Learning}}</ref><ref name=\"JVL\">{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/christianity-2 |title=Christianity: Severance from Judaism |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2008 |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |publisher=[[American\u2013Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|AICE]] |access-date=17 December 2018 |quote=A major difficulty in tracing the growth of Christianity from its beginnings as a [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messianic sect]], and its relations to the various other normative-Jewish, sectarian-Jewish, and Christian-Jewish groups is presented by the fact that what ultimately became normative Christianity was originally but one among various contending Christian trends. Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the [[Early Christianity|Church]], the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]). After the disappearance of the early Jewish Christian sects and the triumph of gentile Christianity, to become a Christian meant, for a Jew, to [[Apostasy in Judaism|apostatize]] and to leave the Jewish community.}}</ref> While the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]] and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of the Second Temple]] in 70 CE were main events, the separation was a long-term process, in which the boundaries were not clear-cut.<ref name=\"Shiffman\"/><ref name=\"JVL\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nEarly Jewish Christians referred to themselves as 'The Way' ({{lang|grc|\u1f21 \u1f41\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2}} - h\u0117 od\u00f3s), probably coming from {{bibleref|Isaiah|40:3|NIV}}, \"prepare the way of the Lord.\"{{sfn|Cwiekowski|1988|p=79-80}}{{sfn|Pao|2016|p=65}}{{refn|group=note|It appears in the Acts of the Apostles, {{bibleref|Acts|9:2|NKJV}}, {{bibleref|Acts|19:9|NKJV}} and {{bibleref|Acts|19:23|NKJV}}).

The inroads into Judaism gave rise to Hellenistic Judaism in the Jewish diaspora which sought to establish a [[Judaism|Hebraic-Jewish religious tradition]] within the culture and language of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]].\n\nHellenistic Judaism spread to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] from the 3rd century BCE, and became a notable ''[[religio licita]]'' after the [[Roman conquest of Greece]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Anatolia]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Roman Judea|Judea]], and [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], until its decline in the 3rd century parallel to the rise of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Early Christianity]].\n\nAccording to [[Burton Mack]], the Christian vision of Jesus' death for the redemption of mankind was only possible in a Hellenised milieu.{{refn|group=note|{{harvp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WgROZMp4zDMC&pg=PA136 136]}}: \"Burton Mack argues that Paul\u2019s view of Jesus as a divine figure who gives his life for the salvation of others had to originate in a Hellenistic rather than a Jewish environment.

But it can be traced to a Strong Greek tradition of extolling a noble death.\" More specifically, Mack argues that a Greek \"myth of martyrdom\" and the \"noble death\" tradition are ultimately responsible for influencing the hellenized Jews of the Christ cults to develop a divinized Jesus.\"<br /> {{harvp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WgROZMp4zDMC&pg=PA93 93]}}further note that \"The most sophisticated and influential version of the hellenization thesis was forged within the German ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\u2014now often referred to as the \u201cold history of religions school.\u201d Here, the crowning literary achievement in several ways is Wilhelm Bousset\u2019s 1913 work ''Kyrios Christos''.

The two most relevant are the Messiah ben Joseph and the traditional Messiah ben David. Some scholars have argued that the idea of two messiahs, one suffering and the second fulfilling the traditional messianic role, was normative to ancient Judaism, predating Jesus.

Jewish messianism has its root in the [[apocalyptic literature]] of the 2nd century BCE to 1st century BCE, promising a future \"anointed\" leader or [[messiah]] to restore the Israelite \"[[Kingship and kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]]\", in place of the foreign rulers of the time. This corresponded with the [[Maccabean Revolt]] directed against the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Following the fall of the [[Hasmonean]] kingdom, it was directed against the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] administration of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea Province]], which, according to [[Josephus]], began with the formation of the [[Zealots]] and [[Sicarii]] during the [[Census of Quirinius]] (6 CE), although full-scale open revolt did not occur until the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]] in 66 CE.\n\n====Resurrection====\nAccording to the New Testament, some Christians reported that they [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|encountered Jesus after his crucifixion]]. They argued that he had been [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] (belief in the resurrection of the dead in the [[Messianic Age]] was a core [[Pharisees|Pharisaic]] doctrine), and would [[Second Coming|soon return]] to usher in the [[Kingdom of God]] and fulfill the rest of [[Messianic prophecy]] such as the [[resurrection of the dead]] and the [[Last Judgment]].\n\n=====Resurrection experiences=====\n[[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3-9]] gives an early testimony, which was delivered to Paul,<ref>''Creeds of the Churches, Third Edition'' by John H. Leith (1982) {{ISBN|0804205264}} p. 12.</ref> of the atonement of Jesus and the appearances of the risen Christ to \"Cephas and the twelve\", and to \"James [...] and all the apostles\", possibly reflecting a fusion of two early Christian groups:\n{{quote|3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br />\n4 and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;<br />\n5 and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;<br />\n6 then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;<br />\n7 then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;<br />\n8 and last of all, as to the [child] untimely born, he appeared to me also.<ref>[[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3-9]]</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Geza Vermes, the concept of resurrection formed \"the initial stage of the belief in his exaltation\", which is \"the apogee of the triumphant Christ\".{{sfn|Vermes|2008|p=138-139}} The focal concern of the early communities is the expected return of Jesus, and the entry of the believers into the kingdom of God with a transformed body.{{sfn|Vermes|2008|p=139}}\n\nAccording to Ehrman, the resurrection experiences were a denial response to his disciples' sudden disillusionment following Jesus' death. According to Ehrman, some of his followers claimed to have seen him alive again, resulting in a multitude of stories which convinced others that Jesus had risen from death and was exalted to Heaven.<ref name=\"Ehrman.1april2018\"/>{{refn|group=note|Ehrman: \"What started Christianity was the Belief in the Resurrection.  It was nothing else.  Followers of Jesus came to believe he had been raised.  They did not believe it because of \u201cproof\u201d such as the empty tomb.  They believed it because some of them said they saw Jesus alive afterward.  Others who believed these stories told others who also came to believe them.  These others told others who told others \u2013 for days, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries, and now millennia.  Christianity is all about believing what others have said.  It has always been that way and always will be.<br /><br />Easter is the celebration of the first proclamation that Jesus did not remain dead.  It is not that his body was resuscitated after a Near Death Experience.   God had exalted Jesus to heaven never to die again; he will (soon) return from heaven to rule the earth.  This is a statement of faith, not a matter of empirical proof.  Christians themselves believe it.  Non-Christians recognize it as the very heart of the Christian message.  It is a message based on faith in what other people claimed and testified based on what others claimed and testified based on what others claimed and testified \u2013 all the way back to the first followers of Jesus who said they saw Jesus alive afterward.<ref name=\"Ehrman.1april2018\"/>}}\n\nAccording to [[Paula Fredriksen]], Jesus's impact on his followers was so great that they could not accept the failure implicit in his death.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Paula Fredriksen, ''From Jesus to Christ''</ref> According to Fredricksen, before his death Jesus created amongst his believers such certainty that the Kingdom of God and the resurrection of the dead was at hand, that with few exceptions (John 20: 24-29) when they saw him shortly after his execution, they had no doubt that he had been resurrected, and the general resurrection of the dead was at hand. These specific beliefs were compatible with Second Temple Judaism.<ref name=\"Paula Fredricksen pp. 133-134\">Paula Fredricksen, ''From Jesus to Christ'' Yale university Press. pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\nAccording to Johan Leman, the resurrection must be understood as a sense of presence of Jesus even after his death, especially during the ritual meals which were continued after his death.{{sfn|Leman|2015|p=167-183}} His early followers regarded him as a [[righteousness|righteous]] man and prophet, who was therefore resurrected and exalted.{{sfn|Leman|2015|p=173-174}} In time, Messianistic, [[Isaiah]]ic, apocalyptic and eschatological expectations were blended in the experience and understanding of Jesus, who came to be expected to return to earth.{{sfn|Leman|2015|p=173-174}}\n\n=====Bodily resurrection=====\nA point of debate is how Christians came to believe in a bodily resurrection, which was \"a comparatively recent development within Judaism.\"<ref>Stanley E.

Mack]] the early Christian communities started with \"Jesus movements\" new religious movements centering on a human teacher called Jesus. A number of these \"Jesus movements\" can be discerned in early Christian writings.{{sfn|Mack|1997}} According to Mack, within these Jesus-movements developed within 25 years the belief that Jesus was the Messiah, and had risen from death.{{sfn|Mack|1995}}\n\nAccording to Erhman, the gospels show a development from a \"low Christology\" towards a \"high Christology\".{{sfn|Ehrman|2014}} Yet, a \"high Christology\" seems to have been part of Christian traditions a few years after his death, and over a decade before the writing of the Pauline epistles, which are the oldest Christian writings.<ref name=\"Bouma\"/> According to Martin Hengel, as summarized by Jeremy Bouma, the letters of Paul already contain a fully developed Christology, shortly after the death of Jesus, including references to his pre-existence<ref name=\"Bouma\"/> According to Hengel, the Gospel of John shows a development which builds on this early high Christology, fusing it with [[Wisdom (personification)|Jewish wisdom traditions]], in which Wisdom was personified an descended into the world. While this \"Logos Christology\" is recognizable for Greek metaphysics, it is nevertheless not derived from pagan sources, and Hengel rejects the idea of influence from \"Hellenistic mystery cults or a Gnostic redeemer myth\".<ref name=\"Bouma\"/>\n\n===Jewish practices and identity===\nThe [[Book of Acts]] reports that the early followers continued daily [[Second Temple|Temple]] attendance and traditional Jewish home prayer.

James the brother of Jesus and Paul, the two other most prominent leading figures in first-century Christianity, were too much identified with their respective \"brands\" of Christianity, at least in the eyes of Christians at the opposite ends of this particular spectrum. But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in Gal 2, had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage, which Paul lacked, and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked. John might have served as such a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself.

Judaism is a material religion, in which membership is based not on [[belief]] but rather descent from [[Abraham]], physically marked by [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision]], and focusing on [[orthopraxy|how to live this life properly]]. Paul saw in the symbol of a resurrected Jesus the possibility of a spiritual rather than corporeal Messiah. He used this notion of Messiah to argue for a religion through which all people \u2014 not just descendants of Abraham \u2014 could worship the [[Yahweh|God of Abraham]].

With persecution by the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene Christians]] from the time of the [[Constantine I and Judaism|Roman Emperor Constantine]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], Jewish Christians sought refuge [[Early centers of Christianity#Outside the Roman Empire|outside the boundaries of the Empire]], in [[Early centers of Christianity#Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and further afield.<ref>[[Hans K\u00fcng|K\u00fcng, Hans]] (2008). \"Islam: Past, Present and Future\".

In 70 CE the Temple was destroyed. The destruction of the Second Temple was a profoundly traumatic experience for the Jews, who were now confronted with difficult and far-reaching questions.<ref name=\"Neusner\">Jacob Neusner 1984 ''Toah From our Sages'' Rossell Books. p. 175</ref>{{refn|group=note|Such as:<ref name=\"Neusner\"/>\n* How to achieve atonement without the Temple?\n* How to explain the disastrous outcome of the rebellion?\n* How to live in the post-Temple, Romanized world?\n* How to connect present and past traditions?\nHow people answered these questioned depended largely on their position prior to the revolt.}} After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, sectarianism largely came to an end. The Zealots, Sadducees, and Essenes disappeared, while the [[Early Christians]] and the [[Pharisees]] survived, the latter transforming into Rabbinic Judaism, today known simply as \"Judaism\". The term \"Pharisee\" was no longer used, perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian, and the rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews.\n\nMany historians argue that the gospels took their final form after the Great Revolt and the destruction of the Temple, although some scholars put the authorship of Mark in the 60s; this could help one understand their context.<!-- Why do they \"need\" to be understood in this context if this is merely what \"many historians argue\"? --><ref>Cook, Michael J.

See, for example, Grayzel, ''A History of the Jews'', Penguin Books, 1984, p. 193.}}\n\nA significant contributing factor to the split was the two groups' differing theological interpretations of the Temple's destruction. Rabbinic Judaism saw the destruction as a chastisement for neglecting the Torah. The early Christians however saw it as God's punishment for the Jewish rejection of Jesus, leading to the claim that the 'true' Israel [[Supersessionism|was now the Church]]. Jews believed this claim was scandalous.<ref>[http://www.oztorah.com/2008/07/jewish-attitudes-to-gentiles-in-the-first-century/ Raymond Apple, \"Jewish attitudes to Gentiles in the First Century\"]</ref> According to Fredriksen, since early Christians believed that Jesus had already replaced the Temple as the expression of a [[New Covenant (theology)|new covenant]], they were relatively unconcerned with the destruction of the Temple during the First Jewish-Roman War.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nIn Christian circles, \"[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]\" later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, were not at first declared to be unorthodox but were later excluded and denounced. Some Jewish Christian groups, such as the [[Ebionite]]s, were considered to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and gentile converts. The Nazarenes, holding to orthodoxy except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]]. The Ebionites may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, \"Ebionite\" was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp.157\u2013159.</ref>\n\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. There was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. It is believed that there was no direct confrontation or persecution between gentile and Judaic Christianity. However, by this time the practice of Judeo-Christianity was diluted both by internal schisms and external pressures. Gentile Christianity remained the sole strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref>Dauphin (1993), pp.235, 240\u2013242.</ref>\n\n===Growing anti-Jewish sentiment in Christian writings===\nGrowing anti-Jewish sentiment among early Christians is evidenced by the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], a late-1st/early-2nd century letter attributed to [[Barnabas]], the companion of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], although it could be by [[Epistle of Barnabas|Barnabas of Alexandria]], or an anonymous author using the name Barnabas. In no other writing of that early time is the [[List of events in early Christianity|separation of the gentile Christians from observant Jews]] so clearly insisted upon. Christians, according to Barnabas, are the only true covenant people, and the Jewish people are no longer in [[Covenant (Biblical)|covenant with God]]. [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Circumcision]] and the entire Jewish sacrificial and ceremonial system have been abolished in favor of \"the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ\". Barnabas claims that [[Hebrew Bible|Jewish scriptures]], rightly understood, serve as a foretelling of Christ and its laws often contain allegorical meanings.\n\nWhile 2nd-century [[Marcionism]] rejected all Jewish influence on Christianity, [[Proto-orthodox Christianity]] instead retained some of the doctrines and practices of 1st-century Judaism while rejecting others.{{refn|group=note|See the [[Biblical law in Christianity#Historical background|Historical background to the issue of Biblical law in Christianity]] and [[Early Christianity]].}} They held the [[Tanakh|Jewish scriptures]] to be authoritative and sacred, employing mostly the [[Septuagint]] or [[Targum]] translations, and adding other texts as the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon developed]]. Christian [[baptism]] was another continuation of a Judaic practice.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&letter=B&search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: \"According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a [[proselyte]] to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab.

Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the [[Early Christianity|Church]], the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries.

The inroads into Judaism gave rise to Hellenistic Judaism in the Jewish diaspora which sought to establish a [[Judaism|Hebraic-Jewish religious tradition]] within the culture and language of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]].\n\nHellenistic Judaism spread to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] from the 3rd century BCE, and became a notable ''[[religio licita]]'' after the [[Roman conquest of Greece]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Anatolia]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Roman Judea|Judea]], and [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], until its decline in the 3rd century parallel to the rise of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Early Christianity]].\n\nAccording to [[Burton Mack]], the Christian vision of Jesus' death for the redemption of mankind was only possible in a Hellenised milieu.{{refn|group=note|{{harvp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WgROZMp4zDMC&pg=PA136 136]}}: \"Burton Mack argues that Paul\u2019s view of Jesus as a divine figure who gives his life for the salvation of others had to originate in a Hellenistic rather than a Jewish environment.

John might have served as such a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself.

Judaism is a material religion, in which membership is based not on [[belief]] but rather descent from [[Abraham]], physically marked by [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision]], and focusing on [[orthopraxy|how to live this life properly]]. Paul saw in the symbol of a resurrected Jesus the possibility of a spiritual rather than corporeal Messiah. He used this notion of Messiah to argue for a religion through which all people \u2014 not just descendants of Abraham \u2014 could worship the [[Yahweh|God of Abraham]].

With persecution by the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene Christians]] from the time of the [[Constantine I and Judaism|Roman Emperor Constantine]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], Jewish Christians sought refuge [[Early centers of Christianity#Outside the Roman Empire|outside the boundaries of the Empire]], in [[Early centers of Christianity#Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and further afield.<ref>[[Hans K\u00fcng|K\u00fcng, Hans]] (2008). \"Islam: Past, Present and Future\".

In 70 CE the Temple was destroyed. The destruction of the Second Temple was a profoundly traumatic experience for the Jews, who were now confronted with difficult and far-reaching questions.<ref name=\"Neusner\">Jacob Neusner 1984 ''Toah From our Sages'' Rossell Books. p. 175</ref>{{refn|group=note|Such as:<ref name=\"Neusner\"/>\n* How to achieve atonement without the Temple?\n* How to explain the disastrous outcome of the rebellion?\n* How to live in the post-Temple, Romanized world?\n* How to connect present and past traditions?\nHow people answered these questioned depended largely on their position prior to the revolt.}} After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, sectarianism largely came to an end. The Zealots, Sadducees, and Essenes disappeared, while the [[Early Christians]] and the [[Pharisees]] survived, the latter transforming into Rabbinic Judaism, today known simply as \"Judaism\". The term \"Pharisee\" was no longer used, perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian, and the rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews.\n\nMany historians argue that the gospels took their final form after the Great Revolt and the destruction of the Temple, although some scholars put the authorship of Mark in the 60s; this could help one understand their context.<!-- Why do they \"need\" to be understood in this context if this is merely what \"many historians argue\"? --><ref>Cook, Michael J.

See, for example, Grayzel, ''A History of the Jews'', Penguin Books, 1984, p. 193.}}\n\nA significant contributing factor to the split was the two groups' differing theological interpretations of the Temple's destruction. Rabbinic Judaism saw the destruction as a chastisement for neglecting the Torah. The early Christians however saw it as God's punishment for the Jewish rejection of Jesus, leading to the claim that the 'true' Israel [[Supersessionism|was now the Church]]. Jews believed this claim was scandalous.<ref>[http://www.oztorah.com/2008/07/jewish-attitudes-to-gentiles-in-the-first-century/ Raymond Apple, \"Jewish attitudes to Gentiles in the First Century\"]</ref> According to Fredriksen, since early Christians believed that Jesus had already replaced the Temple as the expression of a [[New Covenant (theology)|new covenant]], they were relatively unconcerned with the destruction of the Temple during the First Jewish-Roman War.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nIn Christian circles, \"[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]\" later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, were not at first declared to be unorthodox but were later excluded and denounced. Some Jewish Christian groups, such as the [[Ebionite]]s, were considered to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and gentile converts. The Nazarenes, holding to orthodoxy except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]]. The Ebionites may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, \"Ebionite\" was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp.157\u2013159.</ref>\n\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. There was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. It is believed that there was no direct confrontation or persecution between gentile and Judaic Christianity. However, by this time the practice of Judeo-Christianity was diluted both by internal schisms and external pressures. Gentile Christianity remained the sole strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref>Dauphin (1993), pp.235, 240\u2013242.</ref>\n\n===Growing anti-Jewish sentiment in Christian writings===\nGrowing anti-Jewish sentiment among early Christians is evidenced by the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], a late-1st/early-2nd century letter attributed to [[Barnabas]], the companion of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], although it could be by [[Epistle of Barnabas|Barnabas of Alexandria]], or an anonymous author using the name Barnabas. In no other writing of that early time is the [[List of events in early Christianity|separation of the gentile Christians from observant Jews]] so clearly insisted upon. Christians, according to Barnabas, are the only true covenant people, and the Jewish people are no longer in [[Covenant (Biblical)|covenant with God]]. [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Circumcision]] and the entire Jewish sacrificial and ceremonial system have been abolished in favor of \"the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ\". Barnabas claims that [[Hebrew Bible|Jewish scriptures]], rightly understood, serve as a foretelling of Christ and its laws often contain allegorical meanings.\n\nWhile 2nd-century [[Marcionism]] rejected all Jewish influence on Christianity, [[Proto-orthodox Christianity]] instead retained some of the doctrines and practices of 1st-century Judaism while rejecting others.{{refn|group=note|See the [[Biblical law in Christianity#Historical background|Historical background to the issue of Biblical law in Christianity]] and [[Early Christianity]].}} They held the [[Tanakh|Jewish scriptures]] to be authoritative and sacred, employing mostly the [[Septuagint]] or [[Targum]] translations, and adding other texts as the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon developed]]. Christian [[baptism]] was another continuation of a Judaic practice.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&letter=B&search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: \"According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a [[proselyte]] to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab.

Adherents, many of whom are ethnically Jewish, worship in congregations that include [[Hebrew prayers]]. They baptize messianic believers who are of the [[Age of accountability#Judaism|age of accountability]] (able to accept Jesus as the Messiah), often observe kosher\n[[Kashrut|dietary laws]] and [[Shabbat|Saturday as the Sabbath]]. Although they do recognize the Christian [[New Testament]] as holy scripture, most do not use the label \"Christian\" to describe themselves.\n\nThe two groups are not completely distinct; some adherents, for example, favor Messianic congregations but freely live in both worlds, such as theologian [[Arnold Fruchtenbaum]], the founder of Ariel Ministries.<ref>{{cite web|title=About us \u2013 Brief history|url=http://www.ariel.org/amcom.htm|work=Ariel Ministries|access-date=2011-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412235150/http://www.ariel.org/amcom.htm|archive-date=2015-04-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity|Judaism|History|Ancient Rome}}\n* [[Hebrew Christian movement]] \u2013 a 19th-century movement of Jewish converts to Christianity acting semi-autonomously within the Anglican and other established churches.<ref>Kessler, Edward and Neil Wenborn, ed.
