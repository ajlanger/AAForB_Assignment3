The sitcom consisted of 15 episodes that were co-written by Atkinson alongside Curtis and [[Robin Driscoll]]; for the [[Mr. Bean (Mr. Bean episode)|pilot]], it was co-written by [[Ben Elton]]. The series was originally broadcast on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], beginning with the pilot on 1 January 1990<ref name=TL /> and ending with \"[[The Best Bits of Mr. Bean]]\" on 15 December 1995. \n\nBased on a character originally developed by Atkinson while he was studying for his master's degree at [[Queen's College, Oxford|Oxford University]], the series centres on Mr. Bean, described by Atkinson as \"a child in a grown man's body\", as he solves various problems presented by everyday tasks and often causes disruption in the process.<ref name=cavendish>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=2323922005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018071947/http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=2323922005 |title=Atkinson has Bean there and he's done with that |archivedate=18 October 2006 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The series has been influenced by [[physical comedy]] actors such as [[Jacques Tati]] and those from early [[silent film]]s.<ref name=cavendish/>\n\nDuring its original five-year run, ''Mr. Bean'' met with widespread acclaim and attracted large television audiences. The series was viewed by 18.74&nbsp;million viewers for the episode \"[[The Trouble with Mr. Bean]]\"<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096657/trivia Viewing figures] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]. Retrieved 14 March 2008.</ref> and has received a number of international awards, including the [[Rose d'Or]]. The series has also been sold in 245 territories worldwide and has inspired an [[Mr. Bean (animated TV series)|animated spin-off]] and two theatrical feature-length films along with Atkinson reprising his role as Mr. Bean for a performance at the London [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]], television commercials and several sketches for [[Comic Relief]]. Besides the acclaim of the show, another reason for the show's appeal in hundreds of territories worldwide is the fact that the show uses very little intelligible dialogue, making it very accessible to people who know little or no English.\n\n==Origin==\nThe character of [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] was developed while [[Rowan Atkinson]] was studying for his master's degree in electrical engineering at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]]. A [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] featuring Bean was shown at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] in the early 1980s.<ref name=cavendish/> A similar character called Robert Box, also played by Atkinson, appeared in the one-off 1979 ITV sitcom ''[[Canned Laughter (sitcom)|Canned Laughter]]'' which also featured routines used in the [[Bean (film)|motion picture]] in 1997.<ref>''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125687/ Canned Laughter]'' at the [[Internet Movie Database]]. Retrieved 14 March 2008.</ref>\n\nOne of Bean's earliest appearances occurred at the \"[[Just for Laughs]]\" comedy festival in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, in 1987. When programme coordinators were scheduling him into the festival programme, Atkinson insisted that he perform on the French-speaking bill rather than the English-speaking programme. Having no French dialogue in his act at all, programme coordinators could not understand why Atkinson wanted to perform on the French bill instead. As it turned out, Atkinson's act at the festival was a test platform for his character and he wanted to see how his character's physical comedy would fare on an international stage with a non-English speaking audience.<ref name=\"Interview with Rowan Atkinson\">[http://www.justforlaughs.com/videos/show/3889-rowan-atkinson-mr-bean-s-rowan-atkinson-interview-2007_Festival Interview with Rowan Atkinson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405175111/http://www.justforlaughs.com/videos/show/3889-rowan-atkinson-mr-bean-s-rowan-atkinson-interview-2007_Festival |date=5 April 2008 }} at justforlaughs.com.

He lives alone at the address of Flat 2, 12 Arbour Road, [[Highbury]], and is almost always seen in his trademark [[Tweed (cloth)|tweed]] jacket and a skinny red tie. He also usually wears a digital [[calculator watch]]. Mr. Bean rarely speaks, and when he does, it is generally only a few mumbled words which are in a comically low-pitched voice. His first name (he names himself \"Bean\" to others) and profession, if any, are never mentioned. In the [[Bean (film)|first film adaptation]], \"Mr.\" appears on his passport in the \"first name\" field and he is shown employed as a guard at London's [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]].<ref>Mel Smith, ''Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie'', PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, 1997</ref>\n\nMr. Bean often seems unaware of basic aspects of the way the world works, and the programme usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, [[interior decorating]] or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, and his pettiness and occasional malevolence.\n\nIn the beginning of [[The Return of Mr. Bean|episode two]], Mr. Bean falls from the sky in a beam of light accompanied by a choir singing ''Ecce homo qui est faba'' (\"Behold the man who is a bean\") which was sung by the [[Southwark Cathedral]] choir in 1990. The opening sequence was initially in [[black and white]] in episodes two and [[The Curse of Mr. Bean|three]], which was intended by the producers to show his status as an \"ordinary man cast into the spotlight\". However, later episodes showed Mr. Bean dropping from the night sky in a deserted London street against the backdrop of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. At the end of episodes three and [[Mr. Bean Rides Again|six]], he is also shown being sucked right back up into the sky in the respective background scenes (black scene in episode 3 and street scene in episode 6). Regarding the opening credits, Atkinson has acknowledged that Bean \"has a slightly [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] aspect to him\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030217224736/http://www.rowanatkinson.org/articles/00062.htm \"The Fine Art of Being Mr. Bean\"], archive interview in ''The [[Buffalo News]]''. Retrieved 15 June 2006.</ref> In the  ''[[Mr. Bean (animated series)|Mr. Bean: The Animated Series]]'' episode \"Double Trouble\", the alien aspect of him was used in a storyline in which he is taken inside a spacecraft with aliens who look exactly like him and even have their own plushy toys. In an obvious homage towards the end, the aliens send him back home in a beam of light and music similar to the opening of the original ''Mr. Bean'' series. Whether Bean is an extraterrestrial is not made clear.\n\n===Irma Gobb===\nMr. Bean's long-suffering girlfriend, Irma Gobb (played by [[Matilda Ziegler]]), appears in three episodes. In \"[[The Curse of Mr. Bean]]\" and \"[[Mr. Bean Goes to Town]]\", the character is simply credited as \"the girlfriend\". She is treated relatively inconsiderately by Bean, who appears to regard her more as a friend and companion rather than as a love interest. However, he does become jealous when she dances with another man at a disco in \"Mr. Bean Goes to Town\" and she certainly expects him to propose to her on Christmas Day in \"[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean]]\"; his failure to do so results in her leaving him for good. Despite this, she later reappears in ''[[Mr. Bean (animated TV series)|Mr. Bean: The Animated Series]]''. It is revealed in the book ''Mr. Bean's Diary'' that Bean met Irma Gobb at a local library.<ref>Rowan Atkinson & Robin Driscoll, ''Mr. Bean's Diary'', London: Boxtree Ltd, 1993</ref> Ziegler has also played a waitress, a mother and a policewoman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0956126/filmoseries?ref_=nm_flmg_act_31#tt0096657|title=Matilda Ziegler|work=IMDb|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the Comic Relief sketch \"Torvill & Bean\", Bean is accompanied by a female companion portrayed by [[Sophie Thompson]] whose overall appearance resembles Gobb's.\n\n===Teddy===\n[[File:Beanandteddy.jpg|thumb|Mr. Bean and Teddy.]]\nTeddy is Mr. Bean's [[teddy bear]] and, apparently, best friend. This little brown bear is a knitted oddity with button eyes and sausage-shaped limbs which invariably end up broken in half or in various other states of destruction and disfiguration. Although Teddy is inanimate, Mr. Bean often pretends it is alive in which he always buys it a [[Christmas]] present or tries not to wake it up in the morning. For example, when Mr. Bean hypnotizes Teddy, he snaps his fingers and the bear's head falls backwards as if it had fallen asleep instantly. (Bean used his finger to prop Teddy's head up.) Teddy is often privy to Mr. Bean's various schemes and doubles as a tool or other items in emergencies; it has been decapitated (\"[[Mr. Bean in Room 426]]\"), used as his paint brush (\"[[Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean]]\") and shrunk in the wash (\"[[Tee Off, Mr. Bean]]\"). Teddy is also Mr. Bean's \"pet\" in \"[[Hair by Mr. Bean of London]]\" where he is used to win a pet show.\n\nOver the years, Teddy has undergone several changes. When it debuted on \"[[The Trouble with Mr. Bean]]\", it had a smaller head. Two episodes later, its head reached its current size but its \"eyes\" were not present until Bean placed gold [[thumb tack]]s on its face. The \"eyes\" have since been replaced with two small white buttons sewn over Teddy's face, giving it a distinctive image.\n\nAfter filming ended, Teddy was donated by Atkinson to [[Gyles Brandreth]]'s [[Teddy bear museum]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]. In 2008 upon the museum's closing, Teddy was sold at auction for \u00a3180.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/7606177.stm |title=Mr Bean's toy in teddy bear sale |website=BBC News |date=9 September 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===The Mini===\n[[File:Rowan Atkinson on a Mini at Goodwood Circuit in 2009.jpg|thumb|Rowan Atkinson re-enacting a famous scene from the episode \"[[Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean]]\" on a [[Mini]] at [[Goodwood Circuit]] Revival 2009]] \n[[File:Mr Beans Mini.jpg|thumb|right|Mr. Bean's Mini.]]\n\nMr Bean's vehicle, a [[Citron (color)|citron-green]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-02-15/mr-bean-25-facts-and-figures-for-his-25th-anniversary/|title=Mr Bean: 25 facts and figures for his 25th anniversary|work=Radio Times|date=15 February 2015}}</ref> 1977 [[British Leyland]] [[Mini]] 1000 Mark 4<ref>http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_35822-Mini-1000-ADO20-1977.html</ref> with a matte black [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]], was central to several antics such as Bean getting dressed in it, driving while sitting in an armchair strapped to the roof or attempting to avoid a car park fee by driving out through the entrance. In the [[Mr. Bean (Mr. Bean episode)|pilot episode]], Bean's vehicle was originally an orange 1969 [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] Morris Mini 1000 Mark 2 (registration RNT 996H), but was accidentally destroyed in an off-screen crash at the end. Throughout the sitcom, Bean keeps it locked with a bolt-latch and [[padlock]] rather than the lock fitted to the car, which formed a [[running gag]] in several episodes; in two episodes, he demonstrated an additional and innovative security measure in that he removes the steering wheel instead of the key which in one episode deterred a car thief. In \"[[Back to School Mr. Bean]]\", Bean's Mini is crushed by a [[Chieftain tank|tank]] as part of a demonstration after he replaced an identical Mini (registration ACW 497V) meant for the demonstration with his own to secure a parking space. After losing it, he removes his padlock and bolt-latch from the remains. Although the Mini has been crushed, it nonetheless reappears in subsequent episodes with the same colours and registration number (SLW 287R) as the car that has been crushed.\n\nThere were three Minis painted green and black used in the series, as well as two others painted with the same colour scheme but with no engine that got crushed by the tank. One of the main cars was also crushed by the tank. During filming many parts were swapped from car to car throughout production, including bonnets, wheel trims, grilles, steering wheels, rear lights, occasionally the driver's door and the seat covers.<ref>http://www.theminiforum.co.uk/forums/topic/336384-mr-beans-mini/</ref>\n\nAfter filming ended, one of the original Minis was sold to Kariker Kars to be hired for various events whereupon it was temporarily displayed as a major attraction at the Rover Group's museum. In 1997, it was purchased by the [[Cars of the Stars Motor Museum]] and displayed for a number of years, later being sold on to a museum in the United States. The main Mini is privately owned and nearing the end of a restoration in the south of England.\n\nTo promote ''Mr. Bean: The Animated Series'', a replica of the Mini with the registration number DRW 221T was used. This Mini is currently on display at the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalmotormuseum.org.uk/car_collection/mr-beans-mini/ |title=National Motor Museum, Beaulieu |accessdate=13 June 2018 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2018|reason=This ref does not indicate that the car on display is a replica.}} The London Motor Museum also has a replica on display.\n\nThe Mini was going to appear in the [[Bean (film)|first film adaptation of the series]] under the registration C607 EUW.<ref>http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_1057004-Mini-1000-ADO20-1985.html</ref> In the film, Mr. Bean drives his Mini through [[Harrods]] in order to avoid a traffic jam.

Unlike the previous Minis before (which were Austin Citron green), the Mini in the film is 'Nissan Amarillo Yellow'.<ref>http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_97382-Mini-1000-ADO20-1979.html</ref> The film also featured a second version of the Mini with the same colour scheme but with left-hand drive, driven by the female character Sabine befriended by Bean (played by [[Emma de Caunes]]).<ref>http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_97379-Mini-1000-ADO20-1978.html</ref>\n\nThe Mini reappeared in ''Mr. Bean: The Animated Series'' under the registration STE 952R. In 2015, Mr Bean returned in a sketch for Comic Relief in which he drives his Mini to attend a funeral. This Mini bore the same registration as the one in the animated spin-off.<ref>\"Funeral\" sketch on official Mr. Bean YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCsJKaoxr6I</ref>\n\n===The Reliant===\nSince the pilot episode, Mr. Bean has had a long-running feud with the unseen driver of a light-blue 1972 [[Reliant Regal|Reliant Regal Supervan III]] (registration GRA 26K), which would usually get turned over, crashed out of its parking space and so forth by Bean in his Mini, who is usually oblivious to the results. These mishaps also became a running gag throughout the series. In \"[[Tee Off, Mr. Bean]]\", Bean is hitchhiking and the Reliant pulls over for him but Bean, who recognizes the car, pretends to not see it until it leaves.\n\nThe Reliant reappears in ''Mr. Bean: The Animated Series'' under the registration 'DUW 742', again victimized by Mr. Bean in his Mini. In the episode \"Young Bean\", the identity of the Reliant driver is revealed for the first time (albeit shown in a flashback as a child). In the episode \"Car Wars\", after being abused by Mr. Bean for many years, the driver becomes angry and fed up, and decides to get his revenge by giving him a taste of his medicine.\n\n===Other characters===\nAlthough Mr. Bean is the only significant character in the programme, others appear usually as foils for his various antics. Other than his girlfriend Irma Gobb ([[Matilda Ziegler]]), there are more characters in each episode. However several notable British actors and comedians appear alongside Atkinson in the series as various one-off supporting characters, including [[Owen Brenman]], [[Richard Briers]], [[Roger Sloman]], [[Angus Deayton]], [[Stephen Frost]], [[Nick Hancock]], [[Christopher Ryan]], [[Paul Bown]], [[Caroline Quentin]], [[Danny La Rue]], [[Roger Brierley]], [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]], [[Rupert Vansittart]], [[David Battley]], [[David Schneider (actor)|David Schneider]], [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]] and [[Rudolph Walker]]. Vansittart and Walker would later appear alongside Atkinson in ''[[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|The Thin Blue Line]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096657/fullcredits Credits] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]. Retrieved 17 April 2008.</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Mr. Bean episodes}}\n\nAll 15 episodes of ''Mr. Bean'' were produced by [[Tiger Aspect Productions]]. Additionally, the character has been used in one-off sketches, guest appearances and television commercials in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe fourteenth episode, \"[[Hair by Mr. Bean of London]]\", was originally released as a direct-to-video VHS exclusive in 1995, and was not broadcast on television until 25 August 2006 on [[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/mr_bean/episodes/1/17/|title=Mr. Bean - Episode Guides - Series 1 - Episode 14|publisher=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\n''Mr. Bean'' originally aired in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from 1990 to 1995, with reruns later shown on [[Comedy Central Extra]], [[ITV3]] and [[ITV4]]. Due to its widespread popularity, the series aired in many other countries; in the United States, it aired on [[HBO]] starting on 2 April 1992, and also ran on [[PBS]] television stations across the United States. Mr. Bean was aired on the Philippine television network [[ABS-CBN]] in 1992 and later moved to the network's sister station [[Studio 23]] from its launch in 1996 until lasted a year. The series was aired on Malaysian TV channel, [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]] in 1995 and is still broadcast as of 2019. Reruns of the series were also shown on [[Television networks preceding ABC Family#Fox Family|Fox Family]] during the late 1990s, both as segments in the [[Variety show|variety series]] ''[[Ohh Nooo! Mr. Bill Presents]]'' and as stand-alone episodes. Episodes of the series have also been broadcast on [[TCN]]'s Sketch Comedy lineup broadcast by [[NHK | NHK GTV ]] from 1990 and [[Tokyo MX|Tokyo Metropolitan Television (TOKYO MX) ]] from November 2016 and [[Chiba Television Broadcasting | Chiba Television Broadcasting (Ciba-Tele)]] from December of the same year.\n\n==Music==\n''Mr. Bean'' features a [[choral]] theme tune in the key of [[C major]] written by [[Howard Goodall]] (adapted from a passage of \"[[Locus iste (Bruckner)|Locus iste]]\" by [[Anton Bruckner]]) and performed by the Choir of [[Southwark Cathedral]] (later [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]]). The words sung during the title sequences are in [[Latin]]:\n* \"''Ecce homo qui est faba''\"{{Snd}}\"Behold the man who is a bean\" (sung at beginning)\n* \"''Finis partis primae''\"{{Snd}}\"End of part one\"{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} (sung before the commercial break)\n* \"''Pars secunda''\"{{Snd}}\"Part two\" (sung after the commercial break and rarely)\n* \"''Vale homo qui est faba''\"{{Snd}}\"Farewell, man who is a bean\" (sung at end)\n\nThe theme was later released on Goodall's album ''Choral Works''. Goodall also wrote an accompanying music track for many episodes. The first episode of ''Mr. Bean'' did not feature the choral theme tune, but instead an up-beat instrumental piece also composed by Goodall, which was more an incidental tune than a theme. It was used while Bean drove between locations intimidating the blue Reliant, and as such, was sometimes heard in later episodes whenever Bean's nemesis is seen.

Much like the original live-action series, the animated spin-off contains little dialogue; although some words are spoken most is either little soundbites or mumbling. The series introduced a list of new characters alongside regulars in the original series (such as Teddy and Irma Gobb), including an unpleasant landlady of Mr. Bean named Mrs. Wicket and her evil one-eyed cat Scrapper. Other characters' voices are provided by [[Jon Glover]], [[Rupert Degas]], Gary Martin and [[Lorelei King]].<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20030422132605/http://www.rowanatkinson.org/articles/00094.htm Mr Bean Turned Into Cartoon]\" in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 February 2001</ref>\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004, 52 episodes were originally broadcast on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV1]] each consisting of two 11-minute segments.

The first film, ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'', was directed by [[Mel Smith]], released in 1997 and followed the misadventures of Mr. Bean as he oversaw the transfer of ''[[Whistler's Mother]]'' to a [[Los Angeles]] art gallery. The film broke from the programme's traditional narrative by using a subplot with more developed characters, whereby Bean was not the sole centre of attention, but interacted with a suburban Californian family that he stays with during the film. The film was commercially successful, grossing more than US$250&nbsp;million globally ($45&nbsp;million in the USA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bean.htm |title=Bean (1997) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref> on a budget estimated at $18&nbsp;million,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bean.htm Box office figures at boxofficemojo.com].

In the scene, Mr. Bean works within the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in its performance of \"[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]\", conducted by [[Simon Rattle]]. For this scene, Bean does not wear his usual brown tweed [[sport coat|sports jacket]] but the traditional clothing of the musician - [[white tie]] and [[tailcoat|tails]]. As they perform the piece, Bean is mostly bored with playing the same note repeatedly on the [[synthesiser]] and gets jealous of the more interesting part being played on the [[grand piano]]. Still bored, he takes out his mobile phone and takes a picture of himself, looking proud. He then sneezes in a comical fashion and tries to retrieve his handkerchief from his bag behind him, finding he cannot reach it while at the synthesizer until he uses an umbrella to maintain his performance. When he finally blows his nose with his serviette, he throws it into the grand piano.\n\nHe then falls asleep continuing to play the note. A [[dream sequence]] of the opening scene of the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up. Finding that the rest of the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound then stops.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mr. Bean's 'Chariots of Fire' Skit at 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/367792/20120727/mr-bean-rowan-atkinson-olympic-opening-ceremony.htm|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Books===\nTwo books tied-in to the original live-action series were released: ''Mr. Bean's Diary'' in 1992 and ''Mr. Bean's Pocket Diary'' in 1994. The two books have identical content and differ only in the format in which they are printed. The content of both is a template diary with handwritten content scrawled in by Mr. Bean. They provide some additional information on the setting: for example, they establish that Mr. Bean lives in [[Highbury]] and rents his flat from a landlady named Mrs. Wicket.\n\nThey confirm the name of Mr. Bean's girlfriend as \"Irma Gobb\" and also give the name of the other man she actually dances with in ''Mr. Bean Goes to Town'' (Giles Gummer). An additional book also called ''Mr. Bean's Diary'' was released in 2002 to accompany ''Mr. Bean: The Animated Series''; this book was also graded as a children's reader.\n\nTwo further books, ''Mr. Bean's Scrapbook: All About Me in America'' (1997) and ''Mr. Bean's Definitive and Extremely Marvelous Guide to France'' (2007), were released to tie-in with the feature films ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'' and ''[[Mr. Bean's Holiday]]'' respectively.\n\n===Other appearances===\n{{Main|List of Mr. Bean episodes#Other sketches}}\nRowan Atkinson has appeared in character as Bean in many television broadcasts, sometimes as a publicity stunt to promote a new episode, DVD or film. A number of short sketches for the [[Comic Relief]] telethon have also been produced and Bean also starred in various commercials and music videos.\n\n==Home media==\nThe series was available on a number of Thames Television [[VHS]] compilations. In the United Kingdom ([[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]), episodes of ''Mr. Bean'' were released on a yearly basis by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures UK]] from 2004. The complete collection is now available, including the two feature films and other extras. The episodes were released on VHS by [[A&E Home Video]] in the United States in the 1990s. These releases are unique in that they contain the original opening credits for the first three episodes, as seen when originally broadcast on television. In addition, they contain extra scenes which were edited into certain episodes at the request of [[Public Broadcasting System|PBS]], in order to extend the run-time for a commercial-free airing. In Canada, ''Mr. Bean'' was released on VHS by [[Polygram|Polygram Home Video]]. In the United States ([[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]), the complete series has been available since 2003 on [[A&E Television Networks|A&E Home Video]] as \"The Whole Bean\". The documentary ''The Story of Mr. Bean'' is edited on both the UK and USA DVD sets: it was originally 52 minutes when broadcast on television. However, it is 48 minutes on the UK DVD while only 40 on the American DVD. Most notably, in the UK version, the section detailing ''[[The Tall Guy]]'' has humorous clips from the film removed. The American DVD features the same edits as the British DVD but is also missing comments by Burt Reynolds on the set of ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'', comments by Jeff Goldblum, some clips from the show ''Mr. Bean'' and many others. The record-selling UK videos were withdrawn shortly before the release of ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'', and the DVDs were released on an annual basis since 2004.\n\nIn August 2009, an official [[YouTube]] channel of the series was launched featuring content from both the original live-action and animated series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/mrbean |title=Kanaal van MrBean |publisher=YouTube |date=1 January 1990 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe series was re-released by [[Shout Factory]] in North America on 24 March 2015 on [[DVD]] to coincide with its 25th anniversary.

Notably, a number of public figures have been compared to the character usually as an insult. For instance, then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Tony Blair]] was identified by [[Homer Simpson]] as \"Mr. Bean\" when his cartoon form greeted [[Simpson family|the Simpsons]] upon their arrival to the United Kingdom in an episode of the eponymous programme, allegedly demonstrating the stereotypical view of the British by Americans.<ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1231-05.htm Bob Roberts, \"D'oh!

The sitcom consisted of 15 episodes that were co-written by Atkinson alongside Curtis and [[Robin Driscoll]]; for the [[Mr. Bean (Mr. Bean episode)|pilot]], it was co-written by [[Ben Elton]]. The series was originally broadcast on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], beginning with the pilot on 1 January 1990<ref name=TL /> and ending with \"[[The Best Bits of Mr. Bean]]\" on 15 December 1995. \n\nBased on a character originally developed by Atkinson while he was studying for his master's degree at [[Queen's College, Oxford|Oxford University]], the series centres on Mr. Bean, described by Atkinson as \"a child in a grown man's body\", as he solves various problems presented by everyday tasks and often causes disruption in the process.<ref name=cavendish>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=2323922005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018071947/http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=2323922005 |title=Atkinson has Bean there and he's done with that |archivedate=18 October 2006 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The series has been influenced by [[physical comedy]] actors such as [[Jacques Tati]] and those from early [[silent film]]s.<ref name=cavendish/>\n\nDuring its original five-year run, ''Mr. Bean'' met with widespread acclaim and attracted large television audiences. The series was viewed by 18.74&nbsp;million viewers for the episode \"[[The Trouble with Mr. Bean]]\"<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096657/trivia Viewing figures] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]. Retrieved 14 March 2008.</ref> and has received a number of international awards, including the [[Rose d'Or]]. The series has also been sold in 245 territories worldwide and has inspired an [[Mr. Bean (animated TV series)|animated spin-off]] and two theatrical feature-length films along with Atkinson reprising his role as Mr. Bean for a performance at the London [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]], television commercials and several sketches for [[Comic Relief]]. Besides the acclaim of the show, another reason for the show's appeal in hundreds of territories worldwide is the fact that the show uses very little intelligible dialogue, making it very accessible to people who know little or no English.\n\n==Origin==\nThe character of [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] was developed while [[Rowan Atkinson]] was studying for his master's degree in electrical engineering at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]]. A [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] featuring Bean was shown at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] in the early 1980s.<ref name=cavendish/> A similar character called Robert Box, also played by Atkinson, appeared in the one-off 1979 ITV sitcom ''[[Canned Laughter (sitcom)|Canned Laughter]]'' which also featured routines used in the [[Bean (film)|motion picture]] in 1997.<ref>''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125687/ Canned Laughter]'' at the [[Internet Movie Database]]. Retrieved 14 March 2008.</ref>\n\nOne of Bean's earliest appearances occurred at the \"[[Just for Laughs]]\" comedy festival in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, in 1987. When programme coordinators were scheduling him into the festival programme, Atkinson insisted that he perform on the French-speaking bill rather than the English-speaking programme. Having no French dialogue in his act at all, programme coordinators could not understand why Atkinson wanted to perform on the French bill instead. As it turned out, Atkinson's act at the festival was a test platform for his character and he wanted to see how his character's physical comedy would fare on an international stage with a non-English speaking audience.<ref name=\"Interview with Rowan Atkinson\">[http://www.justforlaughs.com/videos/show/3889-rowan-atkinson-mr-bean-s-rowan-atkinson-interview-2007_Festival Interview with Rowan Atkinson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405175111/http://www.justforlaughs.com/videos/show/3889-rowan-atkinson-mr-bean-s-rowan-atkinson-interview-2007_Festival |date=5 April 2008 }} at justforlaughs.com.

He lives alone at the address of Flat 2, 12 Arbour Road, [[Highbury]], and is almost always seen in his trademark [[Tweed (cloth)|tweed]] jacket and a skinny red tie. He also usually wears a digital [[calculator watch]]. Mr. Bean rarely speaks, and when he does, it is generally only a few mumbled words which are in a comically low-pitched voice. His first name (he names himself \"Bean\" to others) and profession, if any, are never mentioned. In the [[Bean (film)|first film adaptation]], \"Mr.\" appears on his passport in the \"first name\" field and he is shown employed as a guard at London's [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]].<ref>Mel Smith, ''Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie'', PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, 1997</ref>\n\nMr. Bean often seems unaware of basic aspects of the way the world works, and the programme usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, [[interior decorating]] or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, and his pettiness and occasional malevolence.\n\nIn the beginning of [[The Return of Mr. Bean|episode two]], Mr. Bean falls from the sky in a beam of light accompanied by a choir singing ''Ecce homo qui est faba'' (\"Behold the man who is a bean\") which was sung by the [[Southwark Cathedral]] choir in 1990. The opening sequence was initially in [[black and white]] in episodes two and [[The Curse of Mr. Bean|three]], which was intended by the producers to show his status as an \"ordinary man cast into the spotlight\". However, later episodes showed Mr. Bean dropping from the night sky in a deserted London street against the backdrop of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. At the end of episodes three and [[Mr. Bean Rides Again|six]], he is also shown being sucked right back up into the sky in the respective background scenes (black scene in episode 3 and street scene in episode 6). Regarding the opening credits, Atkinson has acknowledged that Bean \"has a slightly [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] aspect to him\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030217224736/http://www.rowanatkinson.org/articles/00062.htm \"The Fine Art of Being Mr. Bean\"], archive interview in ''The [[Buffalo News]]''. Retrieved 15 June 2006.</ref> In the  ''[[Mr. Bean (animated series)|Mr. Bean: The Animated Series]]'' episode \"Double Trouble\", the alien aspect of him was used in a storyline in which he is taken inside a spacecraft with aliens who look exactly like him and even have their own plushy toys. In an obvious homage towards the end, the aliens send him back home in a beam of light and music similar to the opening of the original ''Mr. Bean'' series. Whether Bean is an extraterrestrial is not made clear.\n\n===Irma Gobb===\nMr. Bean's long-suffering girlfriend, Irma Gobb (played by [[Matilda Ziegler]]), appears in three episodes. In \"[[The Curse of Mr. Bean]]\" and \"[[Mr. Bean Goes to Town]]\", the character is simply credited as \"the girlfriend\". She is treated relatively inconsiderately by Bean, who appears to regard her more as a friend and companion rather than as a love interest. However, he does become jealous when she dances with another man at a disco in \"Mr. Bean Goes to Town\" and she certainly expects him to propose to her on Christmas Day in \"[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean]]\"; his failure to do so results in her leaving him for good. Despite this, she later reappears in ''[[Mr. Bean (animated TV series)|Mr. Bean: The Animated Series]]''. It is revealed in the book ''Mr. Bean's Diary'' that Bean met Irma Gobb at a local library.<ref>Rowan Atkinson & Robin Driscoll, ''Mr. Bean's Diary'', London: Boxtree Ltd, 1993</ref> Ziegler has also played a waitress, a mother and a policewoman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0956126/filmoseries?ref_=nm_flmg_act_31#tt0096657|title=Matilda Ziegler|work=IMDb|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the Comic Relief sketch \"Torvill & Bean\", Bean is accompanied by a female companion portrayed by [[Sophie Thompson]] whose overall appearance resembles Gobb's.\n\n===Teddy===\n[[File:Beanandteddy.jpg|thumb|Mr. Bean and Teddy.]]\nTeddy is Mr. Bean's [[teddy bear]] and, apparently, best friend. This little brown bear is a knitted oddity with button eyes and sausage-shaped limbs which invariably end up broken in half or in various other states of destruction and disfiguration. Although Teddy is inanimate, Mr. Bean often pretends it is alive in which he always buys it a [[Christmas]] present or tries not to wake it up in the morning. For example, when Mr. Bean hypnotizes Teddy, he snaps his fingers and the bear's head falls backwards as if it had fallen asleep instantly. (Bean used his finger to prop Teddy's head up.) Teddy is often privy to Mr. Bean's various schemes and doubles as a tool or other items in emergencies; it has been decapitated (\"[[Mr. Bean in Room 426]]\"), used as his paint brush (\"[[Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean]]\") and shrunk in the wash (\"[[Tee Off, Mr. Bean]]\"). Teddy is also Mr. Bean's \"pet\" in \"[[Hair by Mr. Bean of London]]\" where he is used to win a pet show.\n\nOver the years, Teddy has undergone several changes. When it debuted on \"[[The Trouble with Mr. Bean]]\", it had a smaller head. Two episodes later, its head reached its current size but its \"eyes\" were not present until Bean placed gold [[thumb tack]]s on its face. The \"eyes\" have since been replaced with two small white buttons sewn over Teddy's face, giving it a distinctive image.\n\nAfter filming ended, Teddy was donated by Atkinson to [[Gyles Brandreth]]'s [[Teddy bear museum]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]. In 2008 upon the museum's closing, Teddy was sold at auction for \u00a3180.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/7606177.stm |title=Mr Bean's toy in teddy bear sale |website=BBC News |date=9 September 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===The Mini===\n[[File:Rowan Atkinson on a Mini at Goodwood Circuit in 2009.jpg|thumb|Rowan Atkinson re-enacting a famous scene from the episode \"[[Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean]]\" on a [[Mini]] at [[Goodwood Circuit]] Revival 2009]] \n[[File:Mr Beans Mini.jpg|thumb|right|Mr. Bean's Mini.]]\n\nMr Bean's vehicle, a [[Citron (color)|citron-green]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-02-15/mr-bean-25-facts-and-figures-for-his-25th-anniversary/|title=Mr Bean: 25 facts and figures for his 25th anniversary|work=Radio Times|date=15 February 2015}}</ref> 1977 [[British Leyland]] [[Mini]] 1000 Mark 4<ref>http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_35822-Mini-1000-ADO20-1977.html</ref> with a matte black [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]], was central to several antics such as Bean getting dressed in it, driving while sitting in an armchair strapped to the roof or attempting to avoid a car park fee by driving out through the entrance. In the [[Mr. Bean (Mr. Bean episode)|pilot episode]], Bean's vehicle was originally an orange 1969 [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] Morris Mini 1000 Mark 2 (registration RNT 996H), but was accidentally destroyed in an off-screen crash at the end. Throughout the sitcom, Bean keeps it locked with a bolt-latch and [[padlock]] rather than the lock fitted to the car, which formed a [[running gag]] in several episodes; in two episodes, he demonstrated an additional and innovative security measure in that he removes the steering wheel instead of the key which in one episode deterred a car thief. In \"[[Back to School Mr. Bean]]\", Bean's Mini is crushed by a [[Chieftain tank|tank]] as part of a demonstration after he replaced an identical Mini (registration ACW 497V) meant for the demonstration with his own to secure a parking space. After losing it, he removes his padlock and bolt-latch from the remains. Although the Mini has been crushed, it nonetheless reappears in subsequent episodes with the same colours and registration number (SLW 287R) as the car that has been crushed.\n\nThere were three Minis painted green and black used in the series, as well as two others painted with the same colour scheme but with no engine that got crushed by the tank. One of the main cars was also crushed by the tank. During filming many parts were swapped from car to car throughout production, including bonnets, wheel trims, grilles, steering wheels, rear lights, occasionally the driver's door and the seat covers.<ref>http://www.theminiforum.co.uk/forums/topic/336384-mr-beans-mini/</ref>\n\nAfter filming ended, one of the original Minis was sold to Kariker Kars to be hired for various events whereupon it was temporarily displayed as a major attraction at the Rover Group's museum. In 1997, it was purchased by the [[Cars of the Stars Motor Museum]] and displayed for a number of years, later being sold on to a museum in the United States. The main Mini is privately owned and nearing the end of a restoration in the south of England.\n\nTo promote ''Mr. Bean: The Animated Series'', a replica of the Mini with the registration number DRW 221T was used. This Mini is currently on display at the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalmotormuseum.org.uk/car_collection/mr-beans-mini/ |title=National Motor Museum, Beaulieu |accessdate=13 June 2018 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2018|reason=This ref does not indicate that the car on display is a replica.}} The London Motor Museum also has a replica on display.\n\nThe Mini was going to appear in the [[Bean (film)|first film adaptation of the series]] under the registration C607 EUW.<ref>http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_1057004-Mini-1000-ADO20-1985.html</ref> In the film, Mr. Bean drives his Mini through [[Harrods]] in order to avoid a traffic jam.

Unlike the previous Minis before (which were Austin Citron green), the Mini in the film is 'Nissan Amarillo Yellow'.<ref>http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_97382-Mini-1000-ADO20-1979.html</ref> The film also featured a second version of the Mini with the same colour scheme but with left-hand drive, driven by the female character Sabine befriended by Bean (played by [[Emma de Caunes]]).<ref>http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_97379-Mini-1000-ADO20-1978.html</ref>\n\nThe Mini reappeared in ''Mr. Bean: The Animated Series'' under the registration STE 952R. In 2015, Mr Bean returned in a sketch for Comic Relief in which he drives his Mini to attend a funeral. This Mini bore the same registration as the one in the animated spin-off.<ref>\"Funeral\" sketch on official Mr. Bean YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCsJKaoxr6I</ref>\n\n===The Reliant===\nSince the pilot episode, Mr. Bean has had a long-running feud with the unseen driver of a light-blue 1972 [[Reliant Regal|Reliant Regal Supervan III]] (registration GRA 26K), which would usually get turned over, crashed out of its parking space and so forth by Bean in his Mini, who is usually oblivious to the results. These mishaps also became a running gag throughout the series. In \"[[Tee Off, Mr. Bean]]\", Bean is hitchhiking and the Reliant pulls over for him but Bean, who recognizes the car, pretends to not see it until it leaves.\n\nThe Reliant reappears in ''Mr. Bean: The Animated Series'' under the registration 'DUW 742', again victimized by Mr. Bean in his Mini. In the episode \"Young Bean\", the identity of the Reliant driver is revealed for the first time (albeit shown in a flashback as a child). In the episode \"Car Wars\", after being abused by Mr. Bean for many years, the driver becomes angry and fed up, and decides to get his revenge by giving him a taste of his medicine.\n\n===Other characters===\nAlthough Mr. Bean is the only significant character in the programme, others appear usually as foils for his various antics. Other than his girlfriend Irma Gobb ([[Matilda Ziegler]]), there are more characters in each episode. However several notable British actors and comedians appear alongside Atkinson in the series as various one-off supporting characters, including [[Owen Brenman]], [[Richard Briers]], [[Roger Sloman]], [[Angus Deayton]], [[Stephen Frost]], [[Nick Hancock]], [[Christopher Ryan]], [[Paul Bown]], [[Caroline Quentin]], [[Danny La Rue]], [[Roger Brierley]], [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]], [[Rupert Vansittart]], [[David Battley]], [[David Schneider (actor)|David Schneider]], [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]] and [[Rudolph Walker]]. Vansittart and Walker would later appear alongside Atkinson in ''[[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|The Thin Blue Line]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096657/fullcredits Credits] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].

Additionally, the character has been used in one-off sketches, guest appearances and television commercials in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe fourteenth episode, \"[[Hair by Mr. Bean of London]]\", was originally released as a direct-to-video VHS exclusive in 1995, and was not broadcast on television until 25 August 2006 on [[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/mr_bean/episodes/1/17/|title=Mr. Bean - Episode Guides - Series 1 - Episode 14|publisher=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\n''Mr. Bean'' originally aired in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from 1990 to 1995, with reruns later shown on [[Comedy Central Extra]], [[ITV3]] and [[ITV4]]. Due to its widespread popularity, the series aired in many other countries; in the United States, it aired on [[HBO]] starting on 2 April 1992, and also ran on [[PBS]] television stations across the United States. Mr. Bean was aired on the Philippine television network [[ABS-CBN]] in 1992 and later moved to the network's sister station [[Studio 23]] from its launch in 1996 until lasted a year. The series was aired on Malaysian TV channel, [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]] in 1995 and is still broadcast as of 2019. Reruns of the series were also shown on [[Television networks preceding ABC Family#Fox Family|Fox Family]] during the late 1990s, both as segments in the [[Variety show|variety series]] ''[[Ohh Nooo! Mr. Bill Presents]]'' and as stand-alone episodes. Episodes of the series have also been broadcast on [[TCN]]'s Sketch Comedy lineup broadcast by [[NHK | NHK GTV ]] from 1990 and [[Tokyo MX|Tokyo Metropolitan Television (TOKYO MX) ]] from November 2016 and [[Chiba Television Broadcasting | Chiba Television Broadcasting (Ciba-Tele)]] from December of the same year.\n\n==Music==\n''Mr. Bean'' features a [[choral]] theme tune in the key of [[C major]] written by [[Howard Goodall]] (adapted from a passage of \"[[Locus iste (Bruckner)|Locus iste]]\" by [[Anton Bruckner]]) and performed by the Choir of [[Southwark Cathedral]] (later [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]]). The words sung during the title sequences are in [[Latin]]:\n* \"''Ecce homo qui est faba''\"{{Snd}}\"Behold the man who is a bean\" (sung at beginning)\n* \"''Finis partis primae''\"{{Snd}}\"End of part one\"{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} (sung before the commercial break)\n* \"''Pars secunda''\"{{Snd}}\"Part two\" (sung after the commercial break and rarely)\n* \"''Vale homo qui est faba''\"{{Snd}}\"Farewell, man who is a bean\" (sung at end)\n\nThe theme was later released on Goodall's album ''Choral Works''. Goodall also wrote an accompanying music track for many episodes. The first episode of ''Mr. Bean'' did not feature the choral theme tune, but instead an up-beat instrumental piece also composed by Goodall, which was more an incidental tune than a theme. It was used while Bean drove between locations intimidating the blue Reliant, and as such, was sometimes heard in later episodes whenever Bean's nemesis is seen. The instrumental of the theme tune was used in the original [[series finale]] of ''[[Mr. Bean (animated TV series)|Mr. Bean: The Animated Series]]'' titled \"Double Trouble\".\n\nIn the episode \"[[Tee Off, Mr. Bean]]\", Goodall's choral theme tune for another Richard Curtis comedy, ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'', is heard playing on a car stereo. In \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean\", while playing with Queen's Royal Guards figurines and the nativity set, he hums \"[[The British Grenadiers]]\", which was quoted in the theme to ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]''.<ref>[http://www.howardgoodall.co.uk/tvthemes/tv.htm howardgoodall.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205022625/http://www.howardgoodall.co.uk/tvthemes/tv.htm |date=5 February 2012 }}.

Much like the original live-action series, the animated spin-off contains little dialogue; although some words are spoken most is either little soundbites or mumbling. The series introduced a list of new characters alongside regulars in the original series (such as Teddy and Irma Gobb), including an unpleasant landlady of Mr. Bean named Mrs. Wicket and her evil one-eyed cat Scrapper.

The first film, ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'', was directed by [[Mel Smith]], released in 1997 and followed the misadventures of Mr. Bean as he oversaw the transfer of ''[[Whistler's Mother]]'' to a [[Los Angeles]] art gallery. The film broke from the programme's traditional narrative by using a subplot with more developed characters, whereby Bean was not the sole centre of attention, but interacted with a suburban Californian family that he stays with during the film. The film was commercially successful, grossing more than US$250&nbsp;million globally ($45&nbsp;million in the USA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bean.htm |title=Bean (1997) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref> on a budget estimated at $18&nbsp;million,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bean.htm Box office figures at boxofficemojo.com].

In the scene, Mr. Bean works within the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in its performance of \"[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]\", conducted by [[Simon Rattle]]. For this scene, Bean does not wear his usual brown tweed [[sport coat|sports jacket]] but the traditional clothing of the musician - [[white tie]] and [[tailcoat|tails]]. As they perform the piece, Bean is mostly bored with playing the same note repeatedly on the [[synthesiser]] and gets jealous of the more interesting part being played on the [[grand piano]]. Still bored, he takes out his mobile phone and takes a picture of himself, looking proud. He then sneezes in a comical fashion and tries to retrieve his handkerchief from his bag behind him, finding he cannot reach it while at the synthesizer until he uses an umbrella to maintain his performance. When he finally blows his nose with his serviette, he throws it into the grand piano.\n\nHe then falls asleep continuing to play the note. A [[dream sequence]] of the opening scene of the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up. Finding that the rest of the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound then stops.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mr. Bean's 'Chariots of Fire' Skit at 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/367792/20120727/mr-bean-rowan-atkinson-olympic-opening-ceremony.htm|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Books===\nTwo books tied-in to the original live-action series were released: ''Mr. Bean's Diary'' in 1992 and ''Mr. Bean's Pocket Diary'' in 1994. The two books have identical content and differ only in the format in which they are printed. The content of both is a template diary with handwritten content scrawled in by Mr. Bean. They provide some additional information on the setting: for example, they establish that Mr. Bean lives in [[Highbury]] and rents his flat from a landlady named Mrs. Wicket.\n\nThey confirm the name of Mr. Bean's girlfriend as \"Irma Gobb\" and also give the name of the other man she actually dances with in ''Mr. Bean Goes to Town'' (Giles Gummer). An additional book also called ''Mr. Bean's Diary'' was released in 2002 to accompany ''Mr. Bean: The Animated Series''; this book was also graded as a children's reader.\n\nTwo further books, ''Mr. Bean's Scrapbook: All About Me in America'' (1997) and ''Mr. Bean's Definitive and Extremely Marvelous Guide to France'' (2007), were released to tie-in with the feature films ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'' and ''[[Mr. Bean's Holiday]]'' respectively.\n\n===Other appearances===\n{{Main|List of Mr. Bean episodes#Other sketches}}\nRowan Atkinson has appeared in character as Bean in many television broadcasts, sometimes as a publicity stunt to promote a new episode, DVD or film. A number of short sketches for the [[Comic Relief]] telethon have also been produced and Bean also starred in various commercials and music videos.\n\n==Home media==\nThe series was available on a number of Thames Television [[VHS]] compilations. In the United Kingdom ([[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]), episodes of ''Mr. Bean'' were released on a yearly basis by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures UK]] from 2004. The complete collection is now available, including the two feature films and other extras. The episodes were released on VHS by [[A&E Home Video]] in the United States in the 1990s. These releases are unique in that they contain the original opening credits for the first three episodes, as seen when originally broadcast on television. In addition, they contain extra scenes which were edited into certain episodes at the request of [[Public Broadcasting System|PBS]], in order to extend the run-time for a commercial-free airing. In Canada, ''Mr. Bean'' was released on VHS by [[Polygram|Polygram Home Video]]. In the United States ([[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]), the complete series has been available since 2003 on [[A&E Television Networks|A&E Home Video]] as \"The Whole Bean\". The documentary ''The Story of Mr. Bean'' is edited on both the UK and USA DVD sets: it was originally 52 minutes when broadcast on television. However, it is 48 minutes on the UK DVD while only 40 on the American DVD. Most notably, in the UK version, the section detailing ''[[The Tall Guy]]'' has humorous clips from the film removed. The American DVD features the same edits as the British DVD but is also missing comments by Burt Reynolds on the set of ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'', comments by Jeff Goldblum, some clips from the show ''Mr. Bean'' and many others. The record-selling UK videos were withdrawn shortly before the release of ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'', and the DVDs were released on an annual basis since 2004.\n\nIn August 2009, an official [[YouTube]] channel of the series was launched featuring content from both the original live-action and animated series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/mrbean |title=Kanaal van MrBean |publisher=YouTube |date=1 January 1990 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe series was re-released by [[Shout Factory]] in North America on 24 March 2015 on [[DVD]] to coincide with its 25th anniversary.

Notably, a number of public figures have been compared to the character usually as an insult. For instance, then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Tony Blair]] was identified by [[Homer Simpson]] as \"Mr. Bean\" when his cartoon form greeted [[Simpson family|the Simpsons]] upon their arrival to the United Kingdom in an episode of the eponymous programme, allegedly demonstrating the stereotypical view of the British by Americans.<ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1231-05.htm Bob Roberts, \"D'oh! Blair Hounds Simpsons to Drop Dog\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821191053/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1231-05.htm |date=21 August 2008 }} in ''The [[Daily Mirror]], 31 December 2003</ref>\n* Arthur Batchelor, one of the Royal Navy captives held by Iran during the [[2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel]], stated that some of his captors had mocked him calling him \"Mr. Bean\".<ref>\"[http://timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1631521.ece?token=null&offset=12 Military banned from selling their stories]\" in ''[[The Times]]'', 9 April 2007</ref>\n*[[National Rugby League|NRL]] referee Sean Hampstead is regularly nicknamed \"Mr. Bean\" in nationally broadcast commentary by television/radio personality [[Ray Warren]] as a result of his similar appearance.\n* In 2007, [[Vincent Cable]], the acting leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] at the time, described the recent decline in Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]]'s fortunes as his \"remarkable transformation in the last few weeks from [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] to Mr. Bean\".<ref>\"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2963664.ece Not so much Stalin as Mr. Bean: Gordon Brown is made to play the fool in stage farce]\" in ''[[The Times]]'', 29 November 2007</ref>\n* The former Spanish Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] is often mocked in his own country for his facial resemblance to Mr. Bean to which a computer hacker broke into Spain's official website for its presidency of the [[European Union]], inserting the character on the front page of the website. Satirists have also compared Zapatero to Mr. Bean when discussing government policies that are deemed to have been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/05/2785561.htm|title=EU website hijacked by Mr Bean}}</ref>\n* Several of the visual jokes in the series have been used as experiments on the [[Discovery Channel]] series ''[[MythBusters]]''. In episode 52&nbsp;\u2013 \"[[MythBusters (2006 season)#Painting With Explosives|Mind Control]]\", the idea of painting a room with explosives (fireworks or other) placed in a tin of paint, as seen in \"[[Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean]]\", was tested and deemed impossible as adequate coverage was not achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2006/05/episode_52_mind_control_painti.html |title=Annotated Mythbusters| accessdate= 2 June 2008}}</ref>\n* An image of Mr. Bean grinning mischievously has been used as an [[internet meme]] for highlighting sexual [[double entendre]]s, usually accompanied by the statement \"If you know what I mean.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=If You Know What I Mean Meme|url=http://weknowmemes.com/2012/02/if-you-know-what-i-mean-meme/|publisher=WeKnowMemes LLC|accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref>\n* Though Rowan Atkinson is not [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] to characters like Mr. Bean, he has played similar characters in other works such as Enrico Pollini in the 2001 film ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]'', and [[Johnny English (film series)|Johnny English]] in the eponymous film series.\n*In [[Tetsuo Hara]] and [[Buronson]]'s [[manga]] ''[[Souten no Ken]]'', a parody of Mr. Bean can be found in a minor character appearing in Chapter 45, contained in Vol. 5. In it, a barman identical to Mr. Bean tends the main character Kenshiro Kasumi for comic relief.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1.p.s.mfcdn.net/store/manga/2979/05-045.0/compressed/snk_v05c45p023.jpg |title=Pages of the manga Souten no Ken, with a character very similar to Mr. Bean in appearance |accessdate=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904183258/http://1.p.s.mfcdn.net/store/manga/2979/05-045.0/compressed/snk_v05c45p023.jpg |archivedate=4 September 2013  }}</ref>\n* In the video game ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', during the opening sequence in the streets of [[Raccoon City]], Mr. Bean's [[British Leyland]] [[Mini]] 1000 can be seen parked against a barricade.\n*''Mr. Bean'' has also been influential on later series, such as ''[[The World of Lee Evans]]''.\n*''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine in the UK, features a cartoon strip, The Adventures of Mr Milibean; in which the-then Labour Party leader [[Ed Miliband]] is drawn as Bean. Milliband was depicted as Bean by cartoonists.<ref>{{cite news|title=Exclusive interview: Is Ed Miliband ready?|url=https://www.ft.com/content/101913f6-acc1-11e4-beeb-00144feab7de|agency=Financial Times|date=2 October 2016}}</ref>\n* An image of Mr. Bean is employed on the [[cybercrime]] website \"Mr. [[Bank Identification Number|Bin]].\"<ref name=\"Mr. Bean & Mr. Bin\">{{cite web | url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/05/carding-sites-turn-to-the-dark-cloud/ | title=Carding Sites Turn to the 'Dark Cloud' | publisher=Krebs on Security | date=4 May 2016 | accessdate=16 May 2016 | author=Krebs, Brian}}</ref>\n* In the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', Mr. Bean's British Leyland Mini 1000 is featured in an online [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mission in which the vehicle has the same colour scheme and registration number SLW 287R. In the game, players are required to steal the Mini during 'Business Battles' and drive it back to their [[nightclub]] property.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of films based on British sitcoms]]\n*[[Uncle Max]]\n*[[Ernest P.
