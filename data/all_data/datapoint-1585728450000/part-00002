He is best known for his work on the Canadian [[sketch comedy]] ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' from 1976 to 1984 (on which he also served as a writer), and as Harold Weir on ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]''.\n\n==Life and career==\nJoseph O'Flaherty<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/51/Joe-Flaherty.html Joe Flaherty Biography (1941-)]</ref> was born in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], the son of a production clerk at Westinghouse Electric. His father was of Irish heritage and his mother was of Italian descent.<ref>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/the-worrier-in-the-comic-mask/article1001345/</ref>\n\nHe moved to [[Chicago]], where he started his comedy career with the [[The Second City|Second City]] Theater as Joe O'Flaherty. Along with several other Second City performers, he began appearing on the ''[[National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'' from 1973 to 1974. After seven years in Chicago, he moved to [[Toronto]] to help establish the Toronto Second City theatre troupe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.secondcity.com/people/other/joe-flaherty/|title=The Second City \u2013 Joe Flaherty|website=The Second City|accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref> During those years, he was one of the original writer/performers on ''SCTV'', where he spent eight years on the show, playing such characters as Big Jim McBob (of ''Farm Film Report'' fame), [[Count Floyd]]/[[Floyd Robertson]], and station owner/manager [[Guy Caballero]] who goes around in a [[wheelchair]] only for respect.\n\nOther memorable Flaherty characterizations included emotional talk show host Sammy Maudlin, seedy saxophonist-private eye Vic Arpeggio, aggressive elocution lecturer Norman Gorman, myopic public television host Hugh Betcha, and \"crazy as a snake\" ex-convict Rocco.\n\n''SCTV'' ceased production in 1984. The same year, Flaherty played Count Floyd in a short-film that was shown at concerts by the rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] before the song \"The Weapon\", for their tour in support of ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]'' (and can be seen in the home video, ''[[Grace Under Pressure Tour (video)|Grace Under Pressure Tour]]'').\n\nFlaherty has appeared in a number of cult favorite films, for example, playing the part of the [[Western Union]] postal worker who delivers [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown's]] 70-year-old letter to [[Marty McFly]] in ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989), as well as the crazed fan yelling \"jackass!\" in ''[[Happy Gilmore]]''. In [[Family Guy (season 8)|season eight]] of ''[[Family Guy]]'', Flaherty once again played the Western Union man in \"[[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]]\". He likewise satirizes his ''Back to the Future Part II'' character in \"[[The Big Bang Theory (Family Guy)|The Big Bang Theory]]\", this time playing a Vatican worker whose role is essentially identical to that of his Western Union character.\n\nIn 1989, Flaherty played a guest role in ''[[Married... with Children]]'' in season-four episode \"Tooth or Consequences\", as a recently divorced dentist who must repair Al Bundy's teeth.\n\nDuring 1997\u20131998, Flaherty starred in the television adaptation of ''Police Academy'' (''[[Police Academy: The Series]]'') as Cmdt. Stuart Hefilfinger. The series lasted for only one season.\n\nIn 1999, Flaherty joined the cast of ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', an [[NBC]] hour-long [[dramedy]] set in the 1980\u20131981 academic year, in which he played Harold Weir, the irascible father of two teens. Despite a dedicated cult following, the show only lasted one season. In the third episode, \"Tricks and Treats\", he dons a cheap vampire costume reminiscent of his \"Count Floyd\" character of the depicted era.\n\nHe made appearances on the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]'' as Father McAndrew, priest at the Heffernans' church. He currently stars on the [[Bite TV]] original program called ''Uncle Joe's Cartoon Playhouse'', and serves as a judge on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] program ''Second City's: Next Comedy Legend''.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2004, he had appeared in various [[Disney]] shows and films including ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'' and ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary|author=Hischak, Thomas S.|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2011|page=74|isbn=978-0-7864-6271-1}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 2004, Flaherty was a member of the faculty at [[Humber College]], where he taught a comedy-writing course. He was also on the program's advisory committee.\n\n==Discography==\n*''[[Gold Turkey]]'' ([[National Lampoon Radio Hour|National Lampoon]] album, 1975)\n*''Count Floyd'' (1982) (RCA)\n\n==Filmography==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|1976-1984\n|''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]''\n|Various\n|Canadian sketch comedy|-\n|-\n|1979\n|''[[1941 (film)|1941]]''\n|Sal Stewart/Raoul Lipschitz\n|Movie\n|-\n|1980\n|''[[Nothing Personal (1980 film)|Nothing Personal]]''\n|Patrol Car Policeman #2 \n|Movie\n|-\n|1980\n|''[[Used Cars]]'' \n|Sam Slaton\n|Movie\n|-\n|1981\n|''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]''\n|Border Guard\n|Movie \n|-\n|1981\n|''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]''  \n|Lawyer (segment \"Captain Sternn\"), General (segment \"So Beautiful and So Dangerous\")\n|Movie\n|-\n|1983 \n|''[[Going Berserk]]''\n|Chick Leff\n|Movie\n|-\n|1984\n|''[[Johnny Dangerously]]''\n|Death Row inmate ''(uncredited)''\n|Movie\n|-\n|1985 \n|''[[Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird]]''\n|Sid Sleaze\n|Movie\n|-\n|1986\n|''[[One Crazy Summer]]''\n|General Raymond\n|Movie\n|-\n|1986\n|''[[Club Paradise]]'' \n|Pilot \n|Movie\n|-\n|1987\n|''[[Innerspace]]'' \n|Waiting Room Patient\n|Movie\n|-\n|-\n|1988\n|''[[Kid Safe: The Video]]''\n|[[Count Floyd]]\n|Educational direct-to-video \n|-\n|1989\n|''[[Speed Zone|Speed Zone (Cannonball Fever)]]''\n|Vic DeRubis\n|Movie\n|-\n|1989\n|''[[Who's Harry Crumb?]]''\n|Doorman\n|Movie \n|-\n|1989\n|''[[Back to the Future Part II]]''  \n|Western Union Man \n|Movie\n|-\n|1990 \n|''[[Maniac Mansion (TV Series)|Maniac Mansion]]'' \n|Dr. Fred Edison\n|Television series\n|-\n|1994 \n|''[[Stuart Saves His Family]]''  \n|Cousin Ray - Funeral \n|Movie\n|-\n|1995 \n|''[[A Pig's Tale]]''  \n|Milt\n|Movie\n|-\n|1996\n|''[[Happy Gilmore]]'' \n|Donald the Jeering Fan\n|Movie\n|-\n|1996\n|''[[Snowboard Academy]]''\n|Mr. Barry\n|Movie \n|-\n|1997 \n|''[[The Wrong Guy]]''  \n|Fred Holden\n|Movie\n|-\n|1999\n|''[[Detroit Rock City (film)|Detroit Rock City]]'' \n|Father McNulty\n|Movie\n|-\n|1999-2000\n|''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' \n|Harold Weir\n|Television Series\n|-\n|2001\n|''[[That '70s Show]]''\n|Bryan (Mountie)\n|Television Series\n|-\n|2002-04\n|''[[Teamo Supremo]]''\n|Cloaked Skull (voice)\n|4 episodes \n|-\n|2002\n|''[[Clone High]]''\n|Abe's Foster Dad (voice)\n|Television Series\n|-\n|2002\n|''[[Slackers (film)|Slackers]]''  \n|Mr. Leonard \n|Movie\n|-\n|2003 \n|''[[National Security (2003 film)|National Security]]''\n|Owen Fergus \n|Movie\n|-\n|2004\n|''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]''\n|Himself\n|Only appears in deleted scene in the DVD edition.\n|-\n|2004\n|''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]'' \n|Jeb the Goat\n|Movie\n|-\n|}\n\n==Characterizations==\nCelebrities impersonated by Flaherty on SCTV include: [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[William F.
