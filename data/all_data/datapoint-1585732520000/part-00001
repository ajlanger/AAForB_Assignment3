At the age of 12, he impressed scouts at a youth tournament in [[Mossel Bay]] and was offered a scholarship at Grey Junior in Port Elizabeth. He  was subsequently offered a rugby scholarship to the prestigious [[Grey High School]], which South African cricketer [[Graeme Pollock]] and England International [[Mike Catt]] had attended. Kolisi was a regular  member of the first XV rugby team. He was also a part of the {{Rut Eastern Province Kings}} youth set-up between 2007 and 2009, playing in the Under-16 Grant Khomo week and the Under-18 [[Craven Week]] before shifting west to join Western Province.<ref name=\"Kolisi\u2019s living the dream\">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugbymag.co.za/blog/details/kolisis-living-the-dream | title=Kolisi's living the dream | work=[[SA Rugby Mag]] | date = 13 June 2013 | accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"reunion\">{{cite web | url=http://www.supersport.com/rugby/springboks/news/130612/Kolisi_a_Green_Gold_father_son_reunion | title=Kolisi \u2013 a Green & Gold, father & son reunion | publisher=[[SuperSport (South African TV channel)|Supersport]] | date = 12 June 2013 | accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>  He further represented the [[South Africa national under-18 rugby union team]] (SA Schools team) for two consecutive years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sablenetwork.com/resources/siya-kolisi-true-story.pdf|title=Siya Kolisi True Story|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nKolisi made his senior debut for Western Province against the {{Rut Golden Lions}} during the [[2011 Vodacom Cup]] and later in the year several injuries and international call-ups gave him the opportunity to make regular starts in the [[2011 Currie Cup Premier Division|Currie Cup]].

The second half of the year was not so kind to him as a thumb injury restricted him to just one appearance in the [[2012 Currie Cup Premier Division|2012 Currie Cup]] and he had to watch on from the sidelines as Province lifted their 33rd Currie Cup title.<ref name=\"WP's Kolisi out for the season\">{{cite web | url=http://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/CurrieCup/WPs-Siya-Kolisi-out-for-the-season-20120826 | title=WP's Kolisi out for the season | work=Sport 24 | date = 26 August 2012 | accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nKolisi returned with a bang the following year and held his place in the Stormers side despite fierce competition among the loose forwards.   13 appearances and 2 tries were recorded and this earned him his first international recognition.
