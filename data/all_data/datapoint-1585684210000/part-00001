It was nominated for three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for [[Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)]].

By the second season, they move up to eighth grade rather than remaining the same age. In this season, Darren has his unwieldy [[orthodontic headgear]] that he has worn for the entire first season removed, which results in rising popularity. They graduate junior high in the middle of the third season and move on to becoming freshmen in high school. Carl's age group works in a same way, as they become junior high students by the third season. Many episodes make references to past episodes, giving the episodes a definite order.\n\nOne of the most noticeable developments is that the characters change clothes every episode and often newer every day within the same episode, a highly unusual characteristic of cartoons in animation.<ref name=\"EW2016\"/> Most animated cartoons have their characters remain in the same outfits throughout the series to save time and money. This was most conspicuous amongst the girls in Ginger's age group (Dodie, Courtney, Macie, Miranda and Ginger herself) and some of the adults such as Ginger's mother. After Darren got his orthodontic headgear removed, he changed clothes as well. Carl's age group changes clothes only infrequently and with few changes. Hoodsey's coat rack has similar purple hoodies, satirizing cartoons whose characters always remain in the same outfits. Unlike most live-action shows whose characters only wear an outfit once, ''As Told by Ginger'' characters wear their outfits in rotation, and new outfits are added every few episodes.\n\nThe series also deals with several deeper themes.<ref name=\"EW2016\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Salamon|first=Julie|title=Grabbing Viewers 'Tween 8 and 14|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/15/movies/critic-s-notebook-grabbing-viewers-tween-8-and-14.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=September 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 15, 2002}}</ref> In \"Wicked Game\", Ginger's two best friends [[betray]] her after feeling [[jealousy]] toward her new boyfriend, Darren.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Wicked Game|series=As Told by Ginger|network=[[Nickelodeon]]|date=August 30, 2003|season=3|number=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Oppliger|first=Patrice A.|title=Bullies and Mean Girls in Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ndz4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA197|accessdate=July 15, 2018|year=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6865-2|page=197}}</ref> In \"And She Was Gone\", the staff and students at school think Ginger is suicidally [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] after she writes a disturbing poem that worries them.<ref name=\"EW2016\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Banet-Weiser|first=Sarah|title=Kids Rule!: Nickelodeon and Consumer Citizenship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWrmQWznHGQC&pg=PA130|accessdate=July 15, 2018|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3993-5|page=130}}</ref> In the episode \"No Hope for Courtney\", Carl's pranks cause his teacher to retire.

One tombstone reads \"ATBG\" while another reads \"RIP\". ATBG is short for ''As Told by Ginger'' and RIP is short for \"Rest in Peace\". This is a nod to the fact that the film is the series finale.\n* A girl named Leandra, who had a bone marrow illness and was a [[Make-A-Wish]] patient, was a fan of the series and watched it during her treatments.

The episode \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" ended with a song called \"Wrong\", sung by voice actor [[Kenny Blank]] as Darren Patterson, and \"And She Was Gone\" ended with a musical version of Ginger's poem during the credits. The episode \"Come Back, Little Seal Girl\" featured the songs \"Courtney's World\" and \"The Little Seal Girl\" blended together. In \"About Face\", a song called \"Diamonds Are Expensive\", presumably sung by the engaged Lois and Dr. Dave, is played over the credits. \"Next Question\" ended with \"The Teen Seal Girl\" song. Finally, the episode \"No Hope for Courtney\" had no music during the credits, being dedicated to the memory of Kathleen Freeman.\n\n==Awards==\n* Three [[Emmy]] nominations for \"Hello Stranger\" (in 2001), \"Lunatic Lake\" (in 2002), and \"And She Was Gone\" (in 2003).

By the second season, they move up to eighth grade rather than remaining the same age. In this season, Darren has his unwieldy [[orthodontic headgear]] that he has worn for the entire first season removed, which results in rising popularity. They graduate junior high in the middle of the third season and move on to becoming freshmen in high school. Carl's age group works in a same way, as they become junior high students by the third season. Many episodes make references to past episodes, giving the episodes a definite order.\n\nOne of the most noticeable developments is that the characters change clothes every episode and often newer every day within the same episode, a highly unusual characteristic of cartoons in animation.<ref name=\"EW2016\"/> Most animated cartoons have their characters remain in the same outfits throughout the series to save time and money. This was most conspicuous amongst the girls in Ginger's age group (Dodie, Courtney, Macie, Miranda and Ginger herself) and some of the adults such as Ginger's mother. After Darren got his orthodontic headgear removed, he changed clothes as well. Carl's age group changes clothes only infrequently and with few changes. Hoodsey's coat rack has similar purple hoodies, satirizing cartoons whose characters always remain in the same outfits. Unlike most live-action shows whose characters only wear an outfit once, ''As Told by Ginger'' characters wear their outfits in rotation, and new outfits are added every few episodes.\n\nThe series also deals with several deeper themes.<ref name=\"EW2016\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Salamon|first=Julie|title=Grabbing Viewers 'Tween 8 and 14|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/15/movies/critic-s-notebook-grabbing-viewers-tween-8-and-14.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=September 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 15, 2002}}</ref> In \"Wicked Game\", Ginger's two best friends [[betray]] her after feeling [[jealousy]] toward her new boyfriend, Darren.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Wicked Game|series=As Told by Ginger|network=[[Nickelodeon]]|date=August 30, 2003|season=3|number=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Oppliger|first=Patrice A.|title=Bullies and Mean Girls in Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ndz4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA197|accessdate=July 15, 2018|year=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6865-2|page=197}}</ref> In \"And She Was Gone\", the staff and students at school think Ginger is suicidally [[depressed]] after she writes a disturbing poem that worries them.<ref name=\"EW2016\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Banet-Weiser|first=Sarah|title=Kids Rule!: Nickelodeon and Consumer Citizenship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWrmQWznHGQC&pg=PA130|accessdate=July 15, 2018|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3993-5|page=130}}</ref> In the episode \"No Hope for Courtney\", Carl's pranks cause his teacher to retire.

One tombstone reads \"ATBG\" while another reads \"RIP\". ATBG is short for ''As Told by Ginger'' and RIP is short for \"Rest in Peace\". This is a nod to the fact that the film is the series finale.\n* A girl named Leandra, who had a bone marrow illness and was a [[Make-A-Wish]] patient, was a fan of the series and watched it during her treatments.

But this version was replaced before initial North American broadcasts with another version performed by [[Cree Summer]]. This would be used for half of the first season before a third version, featuring vocals by R&B artist [[Macy Gray]],<ref name=\"TweensNYT\"/> which was used for the rest of the series' run.\n\nIn the UK broadcasts, the Melissa Disney and Cree Summer versions were used for the first two seasons, while the Macy Gray version was used for season three. Internationally, the Macy Gray version is the most recognizable version.\n\n===Closing credits===\nThe closing credits are generally designed backgrounds with the show's signature font. These backgrounds include the ice cream cones from Ginger's bedroom walls, ladybugs from Dodie's bedroom walls, pencils, lizards and more. In several episodes, the ending theme is an rock-based instrumental, although there have been exceptions. \"Piece of My Heart\" ends with a different and softer instrumental melody. The episode \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" ended with a song called \"Wrong\", sung by voice actor [[Kenny Blank]] as Darren Patterson, and \"And She Was Gone\" ended with a musical version of Ginger's poem during the credits. The episode \"Come Back, Little Seal Girl\" featured the songs \"Courtney's World\" and \"The Little Seal Girl\" blended together. In \"About Face\", a song called \"Diamonds Are Expensive\", presumably sung by the engaged Lois and Dr. Dave, is played over the credits. \"Next Question\" ended with \"The Teen Seal Girl\" song. Finally, the episode \"No Hope for Courtney\" had no music during the credits, being dedicated to the memory of Kathleen Freeman.\n\n==Awards==\n* Three [[Emmy]] nominations for \"Hello Stranger\" (in 2001), \"Lunatic Lake\" (in 2002), and \"And She Was Gone\" (in 2003).
