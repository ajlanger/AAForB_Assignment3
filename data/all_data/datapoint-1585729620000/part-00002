The network is among the few online channels to generate more than 1&nbsp;billion views since launching on YouTube, which does not market a channel on the Roku app store. Young Turks COO Steve Oh acknowledged that making the TYT Network available on Roku was the first part of a strategy to continue the network's growth, regardless of what medium in which its viewers are watching its content, with the intent to figure out a way to monetize its programming through multiple distribution channels, rather than relying on one or two larger channels (such as YouTube or cable television distribution). The network also announced plans to unveil native apps for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. Oh also noted that the network's representatives were speaking with other media platforms about expanding its programming.\n\nIn April 2014, ''The Young Turks'' began offering its content on [[Hulu]]. With this, it began providing a condensed 30-minute version of the program featuring excerpts from the full two-hour daily show, along with a 30-minute weekly version of its daily pop-culture show ''PopTrigger'', with other shows being added shortly afterward. Oh stated on the Hulu launch that, \"as TYT Network has grown from a single show to an entire network, we've consistently found ways to bring our shows to more people[..] We've long admired Hulu as a leader of online video and both parties saw an opportunity to bring digitally-native politics and pop culture talk shows to Hulu's audience.\" He also stated that the company is pitching shows to cable network, but had no immediate plans to revive a television broadcast as either a relaunched program or a show similar in format to the one it formerly produced for Current TV.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cenk Uygur's Young Turks Network launches shows on Hulu |url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-the-young-turks-network-launches-shows-on-hulu-20140321-story.html |first=Ryan |last=Faughnder |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tribune Publishing |date=March 24, 2014 |access-date=May 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315035048/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-the-young-turks-network-launches-shows-on-hulu-20140321-story.html |archive-date=March 15, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe website's yearly revenue was roughly US$3&nbsp;million in 2013.

Young Turks with Cenk Uygur''===\nThe first linear television incarnation of the program began as an hour-long show that premiered on [[Current TV]] on December 5, 2011. Co-created and hosted by Cenk Uygur (who executive produced the series with original program co-creator Dave Koller, with Jesus Godoy, Jayar Jackson and Mark Register serving as producers), the program was co-presented by Ana Kasparian, with Ben Mankiewicz, Michael Shure, Brian Unger, Wes Clark Jr. and RJ Eskow as contributors and correspondents. It was filmed at studio facilities in the [[Los Angeles]] suburb of [[Culver City, California|Culver City]].\n\nCurrent TV announced the launch of a separate television broadcast of ''The Young Turks'' on September 20, 2011, with the program intending to air Monday through Friday evenings at 7:00&nbsp;pm. Eastern Time beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. It was the second news and opinion program to air on Current, alongside ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'', and was part of a strategy to refocus the network's prime time schedule around progressive talk programming (which was followed by the debut of ''[[The War Room with Jennifer Granholm]]'' in January 2012). According to the show's website, the show was titled ''The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur'' to differentiate itself from the popular web series.<ref name=\"CurrTV\">{{cite web |title=The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur |url=http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/ |website=Current TV |access-date=August 5, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807205849/http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/ |archive-date=August 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For two years, the two separate shows were produced each Monday through Thursday, with a one-hour break between the production airtimes of the television and web shows.

The network is among the few online channels to generate more than 1&nbsp;billion views since launching on YouTube, which does not market a channel on the Roku app store. Young Turks COO Steve Oh acknowledged that making the TYT Network available on Roku was the first part of a strategy to continue the network's growth, regardless of what medium in which its viewers are watching its content, with the intent to figure out a way to monetize its programming through multiple distribution channels, rather than relying on one or two larger channels (such as YouTube or cable television distribution). The network also announced plans to unveil native apps for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. Oh also noted that the network's representatives were speaking with other media platforms about expanding its programming.\n\nIn April 2014, ''The Young Turks'' began offering its content on [[Hulu]]. With this, it began providing a condensed 30-minute version of the program featuring excerpts from the full two-hour daily show, along with a 30-minute weekly version of its daily pop-culture show ''PopTrigger'', with other shows being added shortly afterward. Oh stated on the Hulu launch that, \"as TYT Network has grown from a single show to an entire network, we've consistently found ways to bring our shows to more people[..] We've long admired Hulu as a leader of online video and both parties saw an opportunity to bring digitally-native politics and pop culture talk shows to Hulu's audience.\" He also stated that the company is pitching shows to cable network, but had no immediate plans to revive a television broadcast as either a relaunched program or a show similar in format to the one it formerly produced for Current TV.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cenk Uygur's Young Turks Network launches shows on Hulu |url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-the-young-turks-network-launches-shows-on-hulu-20140321-story.html |first=Ryan |last=Faughnder |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tribune Publishing |date=March 24, 2014 |access-date=May 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315035048/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-the-young-turks-network-launches-shows-on-hulu-20140321-story.html |archive-date=March 15, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe website's yearly revenue was roughly US$3&nbsp;million in 2013.

Co-created and hosted by Cenk Uygur (who executive produced the series with original program co-creator Dave Koller, with Jesus Godoy, Jayar Jackson and Mark Register serving as producers), the program was co-presented by Ana Kasparian, with Ben Mankiewicz, Michael Shure, Brian Unger, Wes Clark Jr. and RJ Eskow as contributors and correspondents. It was filmed at studio facilities in the [[Los Angeles]] suburb of [[Culver City, California|Culver City]].\n\nCurrent TV announced the launch of a separate television broadcast of ''The Young Turks'' on September 20, 2011, with the program intending to air Monday through Friday evenings at 7:00&nbsp;pm. Eastern Time beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. It was the second news and opinion program to air on Current, alongside ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'', and was part of a strategy to refocus the network's prime time schedule around progressive talk programming (which was followed by the debut of ''[[The War Room with Jennifer Granholm]]'' in January 2012). According to the show's website, the show was titled ''The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur'' to differentiate itself from the popular web series.<ref name=\"CurrTV\">{{cite web |title=The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur |url=http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/ |website=Current TV |access-date=August 5, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807205849/http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/ |archive-date=August 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For two years, the two separate shows were produced each Monday through Thursday, with a one-hour break between the production airtimes of the television and web shows.
