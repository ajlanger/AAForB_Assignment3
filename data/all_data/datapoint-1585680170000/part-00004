They were generally known as the White Guard in the West due to their opposition to the communist [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]]. In the White Army of Finland many participants were recruits, draftees and [[J\u00e4ger Movement|German-trained J\u00e4gers]] and not part of the paramilitary. The central organization was named the White Guard Organization, and the organization consisted of local chapters in municipalities.\n\nThe [[Russian revolution of 1905]] led to social and political unrest and a breakdown of security in Finland, which was then a Grand Duchy under the sovereignty of the [[Russian Czar]]. Citizen militias were formed as a response, but soon these would be transformed along political (left-right) lines. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the subsequent independence of Finland also caused conflicts in the country. On January 27, 1918, the Finnish government ordered the disarmament of all remaining Russian garrisons with the forces of the White Guard, and on the same day the Reds proclaimed revolution, leading to a bloody civil war. White Guards, led by Gen. [[C.G.E. Mannerheim]], constituted the bulk of the victorious [[Whites (Finland)|White Army]] during the [[Finnish Civil War]] (1918).\n\nAfter the war the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] and a regular police service were founded. From 1919\u20131934 White Guards were considered a voluntary part of the army, and separate Guard formations were in the reserve, but in 1934 all defence was consolidated into the regular army and the Guard became a voluntary defence training organization only. Politically it was neutral, although unofficially it was anti-leftist, clearly anti-Communist and conservative and largely rejected by the labor movement and the political left. However, units of it formed the main forces of the [[Lapua Movement]]'s abortive coup d'\u00e9tat, the [[M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 Rebellion]] in 1932. White Guardsmen served in the regular army during the [[Second World War]]. The White Guard was disbanded according to the terms of the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Finno-Soviet peace treaty]] after the Second World War.\n\nSimilar [[militia]]s existed in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, lands that, like Finland, were under Russian [[sovereignty]] until the end of [[World War I]]. These militias remained in existence until [[World War II]], evolving somewhat into home guard militias. The phenomenon should be distinguished from the [[Freikorps]] established in Germany after its defeat in World War I, although some similarities exist.\n\n== Historical context ==\n{{See also|Finnish Civil War}}\nDuring the first years of the 20th century, Russia had been working on the [[Russification of Finland|abolition of Finland's autonomous status]]. As a result, there was strong discontent in Finnish society. In 1905 Russia lost the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. This stunning and unexpected defeat led to the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. In Finland the unrest was expressed in the [[Finnish general strike of 1905]]. During the strike Finnish police forces were effectively disbanded, as they had been closely associated with the occupying Russian authorities. Municipal, mostly unarmed, security guards were spontaneously organised by individuals associated with the constitutional  and  [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic]] parties. At first all political groups were able to work together, but towards 1906 the civil guards of large towns had become divided along party lines. The first violent clash between Red and White Guards occurred in July 1906 in [[Helsinki]], but after the return of Finnish autonomy the moderate Social Democrats and the whole constitutional party withdrew from military activities. However, the radicalized Red Guard of Helsinki did not disband, despite an order from the Social Democratic leadership to do so, and took part in the mutiny at Viapori fortress alongside revolutionary, anti-imperial Russian soldiers. In the ensuing fighting Czarist Russian troops destroyed the Red Guard as an organisation.\n\n[[Image:Anarkistimatruuseja.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The collapse of discipline in the Czarist Russian armed forces in 1917 created a power vacuum. Here, anarchist Russian sailors are photographed in Helsinki during the summer of 1917.]]\nThe [[February Revolution]] in Russia in 1917 caused the collapse of Russian political and military power in Finland. Again, the Russian-associated Finnish police were effectively disbanded, while the largely undisciplined Russian troops engaged in violence, mostly towards their own officers. During the summer of 1917 paramilitary groups were formed for protection and to preserve order. Although the founding of these \"fire brigades\" was often done in a non-partisan manner, they often split into two opposing factions during the autumn of 1917. The initially unarmed Red and White Guards strove to obtain weapons. The Red Guards usually were able to get arms from  revolutionary Russian military units, while the White Guards got theirs from Swedish and German supporters abroad. At the same time,  political tensions between socialists and non-socialists escalated. Inside the Social Democratic party, the official leadership was derailed while the executive committee of the Red Guards and the labour unions gained more power.\n\n== The White Guards in the Civil War ==\n\n[[File:Whites in Ruovesi 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Whites in trench at [[battle of Ruovesi]], March 1918.]]\n\nThe Senate, led by [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]], proposed a [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], which the Parliament adopted on December 6, 1917. Declaring independence was one thing, but exercising control over the territory was another. Svinhufvud's \"[[Whites (Finland)|White Senate]]\" had nothing but the White Guards to rely on as yet. There were 42,500 Russian soldiers in Finland. Although the [[Imperial Russian Army]] was slowly disintegrating and had already started to withdraw its units from Finland, the demoralized, poorly trained and undisciplined Russian military forces in the country posed a substantial challenge to Finnish authority.\n\nIn parliament the question on forming a new security force was hotly debated. On January 13, 1918, the non-socialist majority gave authorization to the Senate (Finnish cabinet) to organize a police force of the White Guard. Soon the Senate asked [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|General Mannerheim]] to form a new Finnish army on the basis on the White Guard militia. In southern [[Karelia]] the White and Red Guards clashed in small-scale engagements as both sides attempted to secure the railway to [[St. Petersburg]]. During the night of January 27\u201328, 1918, the White Guards started to disarm and arrest the Russian garrisons in [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]]. During the night the [[Finnish People's Delegation|executive committee of the Red Guards]] declared the [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]] in Helsinki. The [[Civil War of Finland]] had begun.\n\nNeither the Red nor the White Guard were trained for combat. Structures had to be built in extreme haste by both parties. The White Army had a better foundation for this, as it received the [[Finnish Jaeger troops]], some 2,000 men trained by Germany since 1915. These soldiers were able to act as instructors and officers, forming the officer and NCO corps of the new conscript army. In addition, the White side had 1,200 volunteers from Sweden, many of whom were officers), and a significant number of Finnish officers who had previously served in the [[imperial Russian Army]] but returned home after the revolution.\n\nAlthough in the beginning of the war the White Guard formed the bulk of the White army, the conscript units very soon matched the White Guard units in number. These troops, which were much better disciplined and trained than the volunteer Guards, proved to be crucial for the outcome of the war. The Red side never accomplished conscription, which was one of the reasons for its demise.\n\nAfter four months of bitter fighting, the Red Guards were defeated and the White Guards were recognized as one of the key agents in the victory, downplaying for political reasons the role of the German intervention units and the German-trained 2,000 Jaegers.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The Civil War was portrayed as a liberation from Russian control after a 20-year-long [[Russification]] programme, with the Whites stressing the links of the Reds to the Russian Bolshevik regime.{{fact|date=August 2015}} However the White victory was achieved with assistance from the Germans. German [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|influence]] after the war was so strong that the independence of Finland was greatly in question until the end of World War I.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n[[File:Tornion valkoisia 1918.jpg|thumb|right|White Guard soldiers after the [[Battle of Tornio (1918)|Battle of Tornio]].]]\n\nThere were reparations in the aftermath of the Civil War. As the Reds had murdered some 1,100 people in their zone of control (the so-called ''Red terror''), the Whites retaliated ruthlessly, executing some 7,370 people after the recapture of the Red areas (the so-called ''White terror'').{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Approximately 4,000 Whites and 4,500 Reds were killed in action. The [[famine]] of 1918 claimed another 20,000 lives. Of those who perished, some 13,000 died in the prison camps.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Because of their ruthlessness and eagerness to retaliate, the White Guards earned the title ''Lahtarikaarti'' (Butcher Guard) among the Reds.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n== The White Guards after the Civil War ==\n[[File:Suojeluskunnan ratsuv\u00e4ke\u00e4 Rautatientorilla. - N2112 (hkm.HKMS000005-000001js).jpg|thumb|White Guard cavalry during a parade in Helsinki, March 1919.]]\n\nAfter the Civil War the function of the White Guards was unclear. In some municipalities the local White Guard was understood to be a part of the municipal administration. In others, the organisation was considered to have a primarily political role in safeguarding the result of the war.<ref>{{in lang|fi}}Sel\u00e9n, K. and Pylkk\u00e4nen, A. (2004).

Changes to the decree were made later, refining the organisation's structure. From the beginning, the White Guard was considered to be a voluntary part of the Finnish military.<ref>{{in lang|fi}}Sel\u00e9n, K. and Pylkk\u00e4nen, A. (2004).

WSOY, Juva. {{ISBN|951-0-29418-7}}. pp. 35\u201336, 165.</ref>\n\nThe local White Guards' function in the following 20 years\u2014up to the [[Winter War]]\u2014was a mixture of [[Veteran Corps]] and [[Militia|Home Guards]]. After 1921 the White Guard organisation consisted of the General Staff, White Guard districts and local White Guard chapters. Every municipality had at least a single chapter, which in part acted as an NGO (non-governmental organization) but in military affairs was part of the national chain of command. In an economical sense, each chapter was responsible for its own funding, although it received a minor grant from the state budget.<ref>{{in lang|fi}}Sel\u00e9n, K. and Pylkk\u00e4nen, A. (2004).

It is estimated that about one-fifth of all get-togethers in Finland were organised by the White Guard. To this end, the White Guard chapters had several hundred choirs, orchestras and theatre groups.<ref>{{in lang|fi}}Sel\u00e9n, K. and Pylkk\u00e4nen, A. (2004).

From 1921 until the organisation's demise, this post was occupied by Gen. [[Lauri Malmberg]]. Usually, the district chiefs and most officers in the district headquarters were from the regular army.\n\nOnly able-bodied males between 17 and 40 years of age could be full members of the White Guard. Every member was required to attend a specified amount of training on pain of losing membership. The members were required to buy their own equipment and rifle, but the local chapters helped their members if the chapters had funds for it. Until 1934 the White Guard would have formed a division in the full-scale mobilisation.<ref>{{in lang|fi}}Sel\u00e9n, K. and Pylkk\u00e4nen, A. (2004). ''Sarkatakkien armeija \u2013 Suojeluskunnat ja suojeluskuntalaiset''. WSOY, Juva. {{ISBN|951-0-29418-7}}. pp. 53\u201354, 335).</ref>\n\nIn 1934 the Finnish mobilisation system was changed. The new system was based on military districts acting as the local mobilization centers. In practice, the military districts coincided with the White Guard districts. In case of mobilisation these two would be unified to act as a single home front district. After the change, the White Guard members formed the cadre of all wartime units, but no specific guard units were planned for mobilisation. On the other hand, the separate wartime White Guard units were removed from the mobilisation plans. The aim of the White Guard was no longer to provide ready fighting units but to act as a voluntary training organisation for reservists. Only the Guard chapters immediately adjacent to the eastern border had responsibility for starting the initial defence against invasion.<ref>{{in lang|fi}}Sel\u00e9n, K. and Pylkk\u00e4nen, A.

In the home area the Guard districts formed the local headquarters for the military districts and the oldest and youngest Guard members served in guard and anti-aircraft duties. There were some small anti-[[desant]] actions on the home front, e.g. in Hollola in 1941. After the [[Continuation War]], the Finnish White Guards were disbanded in 1944, as demanded by the [[Soviet Union]]. However, the military district system as the basis for mobilisation was retained, now fully as an army structure. In the Winter War the White Guard was responsible for the carrying out of the mobilisation. A quarter of the manpower of the field army consisted of Guard members. This contribution proved important, as Guard members were the best trained and equipped personnel in an army which lacked even basic supplies.\n\n==Strength==\n{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

During the 1920s Socialists had demanded the White Guards be demobilised, but as the Guard leadership and the overwhelming majority of the members remained loyal to the government during [[M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 rebellion]], the demands were changed to making the Guards an official part of the army.\n\nThe political rift between the White Guard and the labour movement was ultimately healed during the Winter War, when leadership of the Guard and the Social Democratic Party issued a joint statement February 15, 1940, in which the Guard leadership recommended local Guards to recruit Socialists and the Party leadership recommended to its members that they join the Guards. At the same time, the employers' associations conceded to collective-bargaining agreements with the trade unions.\n\nThe White Guards' relations towards non-socialist parties were mostly warm. The Guard did not distinguish between any non-socialist political views and received the support of all non-socialist parties. Only during the M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 rebellion did these relations deteriorate, as some more radical parts of the Guard were linked with the extreme right-wing.\n\n==Heritage==\n[[Image:Suojeluskuntien kilvet ja merkit.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A selection of Suojeluskunta insignia]]\nOne of the chapters of the [[Treaty of Paris (1947)]] was disbandment of all \"fascist-like organizations\". The Soviet Union considered that the White Guard and [[Lotta Sv\u00e4rd]] were fascist organizations, and they were disbanded.\n\nThe disbanding of the White Guard effectively ended all Finnish voluntary military training for the next several decades. The sports activities of the Guard were taken over by ordinary civilian sports associations, while the psychological work of instilling a national defence spirit was continued by the reservists' associations. However, the Guard itself is a contentious issue, which still divides the people along political lines.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Finland unilaterally renounced the military articles of the [[Treaty of Paris (1947)|Paris Peace Treaty of 1947]].{{cn|date=June 2019}} Following this, the NGOs working in fields with connections to [[total defence]] formed the [[National Defence Training Association of Finland]] ({{lang-fi|Maanpuolustuskoulutus ry}}), which started to organise supplemental voluntary training primarily for [[Finnish Defence Forces]] reservists in conjunction with the Defence Forces. The legal basis for the activities was given by changing the Act on Defence Forces in 1994. More accurate basis was given by the Act on Voluntary Defence Work of 2007, which will make the Association a nominally independent public organization under political state control. As the heritage of the White Guard in Finland is very mixed, the National Defence Training Association does not consider itself to be the successor of the White Guard.\n\nIn 2007 formation of [[Territorial Forces (Finland)|Territorial Forces]] was started, a volunteer military organization composed of reservists. Some political groups have criticized formation of these units, saying that they are too close to White Guards that were abolished as fascist organization in 1944. However, unlike the White Guard, local defense troops are not a separate organization, but fully in the control of the Finnish Defence Forces.\n\n== Dress and insignia ==\n[[Image:AM.017147.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An officer's uniform (1924).]]\nThe first ''ad hoc'' symbols were a white [[armband]] and a small, three-branched shoot from a [[spruce]] branch, placed into the hat. The basic insignia was an embroidered [[badge]] with a white \"S\" topped by three single shoots of spruce branches. The badge and the \"S\" were embroidered with a gold-colored border. The symbol worn by General [[C.G.E. Mannerheim]] had a blue field, but in the provinces, the field was divided (party per sinister), with two or three colors representing each province. The white armband also bore the name of the municipality. Each chapter had its own flag, but generally it was a symmetric variant of the modern [[Flag of Finland|State Flag of Finland]] where the cross was extended with small swastika arms, the \"S\" symbol in the canton and local symbols instead of the coat of arms.<ref>http://wiki.narc.fi/portti/index.php/Suojeluskuntien_lippupiirustuskokoelma <br>Also, for example, see the [http://digi.narc.fi/digi/view.ka?kuid=1625653 Myrskyl\u00e4 suojeluskunta flag] in the National Archive.</ref>\n\nThe rank insignia was rather different from [[Finnish military ranks|modern Finnish insignia]]. In principle, the enlisted did not have a rank system, and there was only one officer rank (''suojeluskuntaupseeri''), marked by a single metal spruce branch worn on the collar. However, task-specific insignia was used instead. [[Underofficer]]s wore a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] pointed downwards, and chiefs of local chapters wore 1\u20134 horizontal bars, the number depending on the size of the chapter. It must be kept in mind that ''Suojeluskunnat'' were a civilian organization and many members did not have formal military training. Those members who had served in the military held a separate rank in reserve.\n\nUniforms were Swedish and German-style and in \"field gray\" (''[[Feldgrau]]'') color.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Red Guards (Finland)]]\n* [[Lotta Sv\u00e4rd]] \u2013 voluntary auxiliary organisation for women.\n* [[Local Defence troops (Finland)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Suojeluskuntaj\u00e4rjest\u00f6}}\n*[http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/TheCivilGuardOfFinland.asp THE SUOJELUSKUNTA: A History Of The Finnish Civil Guard] by Jarkko Vihavainen\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Finnish anti-communists]]\n[[Category:Finnish nationalism]]\n[[Category:Finnish Civil War]]\n[[Category:Paramilitary organisations based in Finland]]\n[[Category:1917 establishments in Finland]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1944]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations of the Russian Civil War]]\n[[Category:Anti-communist organizations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}\n{{Infobox Government agency\n|agency_name   = Civil Guard\n|nativename    = Suojeluskunnat\n|nativename_a  = Skyddsk\u00e5r\n|nativename_r  =\n|logo          = \n|logo_width    = 175px\n|logo_caption  = General Headquarters badge\n|seal          =\n|seal_width    =\n|seal_caption  =\n|picture       = Suojeluskunta.jpg\n|picture_width = 300px\n|picture_caption = White Guard of [[Nummi (municipality)|Nummi]] in 1930s\n|formed        = 1918\n|preceding1    = Kansalliskaarti\n|dissolved     = 1944\n|superseding   = [[Finnish Defence Forces]]\n|jurisdiction  = Finland\n|headquarters  =\n|coordinates   = \n|employees     =\n|budget        =\n|minister1_name  =\n|minister1_pfo   =\n|minister2_name  =\n|minister2_pfo   =\n|chief1_name     =\n|chief1_position =\n|chief2_name     =\n|chief2_position =\n|agency_type   = Volunteer militia\n|parent_agency =\n|child1_agency =\n|child2_agency =\n|keydocument1=\n|website       =\n|footnotes     =\n|map       =\n|map_width =\n|map_caption =\n}}\n\nThe '''White Guard''' or '''Civil Guard''' ({{Lang-fi|Suojeluskunta}}, {{Lang-sv|Skyddsk\u00e5r}}, lit. protection corps){{Ref|Other possible translations include Protection Guard, Protection Corps, White Militia and Protection Militia.}} was a voluntary [[militia]] that emerged victorious over the socialist [[Red Guard (Finland)|Red Guards]] as a part of the [[Whites (Finland)|Whites]] in the [[Finnish Civil War]] of 1918.

However, the radicalized Red Guard of Helsinki did not disband, despite an order from the Social Democratic leadership to do so, and took part in the mutiny at Viapori fortress alongside revolutionary, anti-imperial Russian soldiers. In the ensuing fighting Czarist Russian troops destroyed the Red Guard as an organisation.\n\n[[Image:Anarkistimatruuseja.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The collapse of discipline in the Czarist Russian armed forces in 1917 created a power vacuum. Here, anarchist Russian sailors are photographed in Helsinki during the summer of 1917.]]\nThe [[February Revolution]] in Russia in 1917 caused the collapse of Russian political and military power in Finland. Again, the Russian-associated Finnish police were effectively disbanded, while the largely undisciplined Russian troops engaged in violence, mostly towards their own officers. During the summer of 1917 paramilitary groups were formed for protection and to preserve order. Although the founding of these \"fire brigades\" was often done in a non-partisan manner, they often split into two opposing factions during the autumn of 1917. The initially unarmed Red and White Guards strove to obtain weapons. The Red Guards usually were able to get arms from  revolutionary Russian military units, while the White Guards got theirs from Swedish and German supporters abroad. At the same time,  political tensions between socialists and non-socialists escalated. Inside the Social Democratic party, the official leadership was derailed while the executive committee of the Red Guards and the labour unions gained more power.\n\n== The White Guards in the Civil War ==\n\n[[File:Whites in Ruovesi 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Whites in trench at [[battle of Ruovesi]], March 1918.]]\n\nThe Senate, led by [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]], proposed a [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], which the Parliament adopted on December 6, 1917. Declaring independence was one thing, but exercising control over the territory was another. Svinhufvud's \"[[Whites (Finland)|White Senate]]\" had nothing but the White Guards to rely on as yet. There were 42,500 Russian soldiers in Finland. Although the [[Imperial Russian Army]] was slowly disintegrating and had already started to withdraw its units from Finland, the demoralized, poorly trained and undisciplined Russian military forces in the country posed a substantial challenge to Finnish authority.\n\nIn parliament the question on forming a new security force was hotly debated. On January 13, 1918, the non-socialist majority gave authorization to the Senate (Finnish cabinet) to organize a police force of the White Guard. Soon the Senate asked [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|General Mannerheim]] to form a new Finnish army on the basis on the White Guard militia. In southern [[Karelia]] the White and Red Guards clashed in small-scale engagements as both sides attempted to secure the railway to [[St. Petersburg]]. During the night of January 27\u201328, 1918, the White Guards started to disarm and arrest the Russian garrisons in [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]]. During the night the [[Finnish People's Delegation|executive committee of the Red Guards]] declared the [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]] in Helsinki. The [[Civil War of Finland]] had begun.\n\nNeither the Red nor the White Guard were trained for combat. Structures had to be built in extreme haste by both parties. The White Army had a better foundation for this, as it received the [[Finnish Jaeger troops]], some 2,000 men trained by Germany since 1915. These soldiers were able to act as instructors and officers, forming the officer and NCO corps of the new conscript army. In addition, the White side had 1,200 volunteers from Sweden, many of whom were officers), and a significant number of Finnish officers who had previously served in the [[imperial Russian Army]] but returned home after the revolution.\n\nAlthough in the beginning of the war the White Guard formed the bulk of the White army, the conscript units very soon matched the White Guard units in number. These troops, which were much better disciplined and trained than the volunteer Guards, proved to be crucial for the outcome of the war. The Red side never accomplished conscription, which was one of the reasons for its demise.\n\nAfter four months of bitter fighting, the Red Guards were defeated and the White Guards were recognized as one of the key agents in the victory, downplaying for political reasons the role of the German intervention units and the German-trained 2,000 Jaegers.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The Civil War was portrayed as a liberation from Russian control after a 20-year-long [[Russification]] programme, with the Whites stressing the links of the Reds to the Russian Bolshevik regime.{{fact|date=August 2015}} However the White victory was achieved with assistance from the Germans. German [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|influence]] after the war was so strong that the independence of Finland was greatly in question until the end of World War I.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n[[File:Tornion valkoisia 1918.jpg|thumb|right|White Guard soldiers after the [[Battle of Tornio (1918)|Battle of Tornio]].]]\n\nThere were reparations in the aftermath of the Civil War. As the Reds had murdered some 1,100 people in their zone of control (the so-called ''Red terror''), the Whites retaliated ruthlessly, executing some 7,370 people after the recapture of the Red areas (the so-called ''White terror'').{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Approximately 4,000 Whites and 4,500 Reds were killed in action. The [[famine]] of 1918 claimed another 20,000 lives. Of those who perished, some 13,000 died in the prison camps.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Because of their ruthlessness and eagerness to retaliate, the White Guards earned the title ''Lahtarikaarti'' (Butcher Guard) among the Reds.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n== The White Guards after the Civil War ==\n[[File:Suojeluskunnan ratsuv\u00e4ke\u00e4 Rautatientorilla. - N2112 (hkm.HKMS000005-000001js).jpg|thumb|White Guard cavalry during a parade in Helsinki, March 1919.]]\n\nAfter the Civil War the function of the White Guards was unclear. In some municipalities the local White Guard was understood to be a part of the municipal administration. In others, the organisation was considered to have a primarily political role in safeguarding the result of the war.<ref>{{in lang|fi}}Sel\u00e9n, K. and Pylkk\u00e4nen, A. (2004).

Changes to the decree were made later, refining the organisation's structure.

After 1921 the White Guard organisation consisted of the General Staff, White Guard districts and local White Guard chapters. Every municipality had at least a single chapter, which in part acted as an NGO (non-governmental organization) but in military affairs was part of the national chain of command. In an economical sense, each chapter was responsible for its own funding, although it received a minor grant from the state budget.<ref>{{in lang|fi}}Sel\u00e9n, K. and Pylkk\u00e4nen, A. (2004).

It is estimated that about one-fifth of all get-togethers in Finland were organised by the White Guard. To this end, the White Guard chapters had several hundred choirs, orchestras and theatre groups.<ref>{{in lang|fi}}Sel\u00e9n, K. and Pylkk\u00e4nen, A. (2004).

From 1921 until the organisation's demise, this post was occupied by Gen. [[Lauri Malmberg]]. Usually, the district chiefs and most officers in the district headquarters were from the regular army.\n\nOnly able-bodied males between 17 and 40 years of age could be full members of the White Guard. Every member was required to attend a specified amount of training on pain of losing membership. The members were required to buy their own equipment and rifle, but the local chapters helped their members if the chapters had funds for it. Until 1934 the White Guard would have formed a division in the full-scale mobilisation.<ref>{{in lang|fi}}Sel\u00e9n, K. and Pylkk\u00e4nen, A. (2004). ''Sarkatakkien armeija \u2013 Suojeluskunnat ja suojeluskuntalaiset''. WSOY, Juva. {{ISBN|951-0-29418-7}}. pp. 53\u201354, 335).</ref>\n\nIn 1934 the Finnish mobilisation system was changed. The new system was based on military districts acting as the local mobilization centers. In practice, the military districts coincided with the White Guard districts. In case of mobilisation these two would be unified to act as a single home front district. After the change, the White Guard members formed the cadre of all wartime units, but no specific guard units were planned for mobilisation. On the other hand, the separate wartime White Guard units were removed from the mobilisation plans. The aim of the White Guard was no longer to provide ready fighting units but to act as a voluntary training organisation for reservists. Only the Guard chapters immediately adjacent to the eastern border had responsibility for starting the initial defence against invasion.<ref>{{in lang|fi}}Sel\u00e9n, K. and Pylkk\u00e4nen, A.

In the home area the Guard districts formed the local headquarters for the military districts and the oldest and youngest Guard members served in guard and anti-aircraft duties. There were some small anti-[[desant]] actions on the home front, e.g. in Hollola in 1941. After the [[Continuation War]], the Finnish White Guards were disbanded in 1944, as demanded by the [[Soviet Union]]. However, the military district system as the basis for mobilisation was retained, now fully as an army structure. In the Winter War the White Guard was responsible for the carrying out of the mobilisation. A quarter of the manpower of the field army consisted of Guard members. This contribution proved important, as Guard members were the best trained and equipped personnel in an army which lacked even basic supplies.\n\n==Strength==\n{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

During the 1920s Socialists had demanded the White Guards be demobilised, but as the Guard leadership and the overwhelming majority of the members remained loyal to the government during [[M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 rebellion]], the demands were changed to making the Guards an official part of the army.\n\nThe political rift between the White Guard and the labour movement was ultimately healed during the Winter War, when leadership of the Guard and the Social Democratic Party issued a joint statement February 15, 1940, in which the Guard leadership recommended local Guards to recruit Socialists and the Party leadership recommended to its members that they join the Guards. At the same time, the employers' associations conceded to collective-bargaining agreements with the trade unions.\n\nThe White Guards' relations towards non-socialist parties were mostly warm. The Guard did not distinguish between any non-socialist political views and received the support of all non-socialist parties. Only during the M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 rebellion did these relations deteriorate, as some more radical parts of the Guard were linked with the extreme right-wing.\n\n==Heritage==\n[[Image:Suojeluskuntien kilvet ja merkit.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A selection of Suojeluskunta insignia]]\nOne of the chapters of the [[Treaty of Paris (1947)]] was disbandment of all \"fascist-like organizations\". The Soviet Union considered that the White Guard and [[Lotta Sv\u00e4rd]] were fascist organizations, and they were disbanded.\n\nThe disbanding of the White Guard effectively ended all Finnish voluntary military training for the next several decades. The sports activities of the Guard were taken over by ordinary civilian sports associations, while the psychological work of instilling a national defence spirit was continued by the reservists' associations. However, the Guard itself is a contentious issue, which still divides the people along political lines.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Finland unilaterally renounced the military articles of the [[Treaty of Paris (1947)|Paris Peace Treaty of 1947]].{{cn|date=June 2019}} Following this, the NGOs working in fields with connections to [[total defence]] formed the [[National Defence Training Association of Finland]] ({{lang-fi|Maanpuolustuskoulutus ry}}), which started to organise supplemental voluntary training primarily for [[Finnish Defence Forces]] reservists in conjunction with the Defence Forces. The legal basis for the activities was given by changing the Act on Defence Forces in 1994. More accurate basis was given by the Act on Voluntary Defence Work of 2007, which will make the Association a nominally independent public organization under political state control. As the heritage of the White Guard in Finland is very mixed, the National Defence Training Association does not consider itself to be the successor of the White Guard.\n\nIn 2007 formation of [[Territorial Forces (Finland)|Territorial Forces]] was started, a volunteer military organization composed of reservists. Some political groups have criticized formation of these units, saying that they are too close to White Guards that were abolished as fascist organization in 1944. However, unlike the White Guard, local defense troops are not a separate organization, but fully in the control of the Finnish Defence Forces.\n\n== Dress and insignia ==\n[[Image:AM.017147.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An officer's uniform (1924).]]\nThe first ''ad hoc'' symbols were a white [[armband]] and a small, three-branched shoot from a [[spruce]] branch, placed into the hat. The basic insignia was an embroidered [[badge]] with a white \"S\" topped by three single shoots of spruce branches. The badge and the \"S\" were embroidered with a gold-colored border. The symbol worn by General [[C.G.E. Mannerheim]] had a blue field, but in the provinces, the field was divided (party per sinister), with two or three colors representing each province. The white armband also bore the name of the municipality. Each chapter had its own flag, but generally it was a symmetric variant of the modern [[Flag of Finland|State Flag of Finland]] where the cross was extended with small swastika arms, the \"S\" symbol in the canton and local symbols instead of the coat of arms.<ref>http://wiki.narc.fi/portti/index.php/Suojeluskuntien_lippupiirustuskokoelma <br>Also, for example, see the [http://digi.narc.fi/digi/view.ka?kuid=1625653 Myrskyl\u00e4 suojeluskunta flag] in the National Archive.</ref>\n\nThe rank insignia was rather different from [[Finnish military ranks|modern Finnish insignia]]. In principle, the enlisted did not have a rank system, and there was only one officer rank (''suojeluskuntaupseeri''), marked by a single metal spruce branch worn on the collar. However, task-specific insignia was used instead. [[Underofficer]]s wore a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] pointed downwards, and chiefs of local chapters wore 1\u20134 horizontal bars, the number depending on the size of the chapter. It must be kept in mind that ''Suojeluskunnat'' were a civilian organization and many members did not have formal military training. Those members who had served in the military held a separate rank in reserve.\n\nUniforms were Swedish and German-style and in \"field gray\" (''[[Feldgrau]]'') color.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Red Guards (Finland)]]\n* [[Lotta Sv\u00e4rd]] \u2013 voluntary auxiliary organisation for women.\n* [[Local Defence troops (Finland)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Suojeluskuntaj\u00e4rjest\u00f6}}\n*[http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/TheCivilGuardOfFinland.asp THE SUOJELUSKUNTA: A History Of The Finnish Civil Guard] by Jarkko Vihavainen\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Finnish anti-communists]]\n[[Category:Finnish nationalism]]\n[[Category:Finnish Civil War]]\n[[Category:Paramilitary organisations based in Finland]]\n[[Category:1917 establishments in Finland]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1944]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations of the Russian Civil War]]\n[[Category:Anti-communist organizations]]\n", "name_user": "HandsomeFella", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStrength", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Guard_(Finland)"}
