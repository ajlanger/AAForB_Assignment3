Tartarus is seen as a prison, but is also where [[Hemera|Day,]] [[Nyx|Night]], [[Hypnos|Sleep]] and [[Thanatos|Death]] dwell, and also imagined as a great gorge that's a distinct part of the underworld. Hesiod tells that it took ten days for the Titans to fall to the bottom of Tartarus, describing how deep the abyss is.<ref name=\":2\" /> In some versions Tartarus is described as a \"misty darkness\"<ref name=\":4\" /> where Death, Styx, and Erebus reside.\n\n==Non-Hesiodic theogonies ==\nThe [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] entertained different versions of the origin of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|primordial deities]].

He argues that Chaos represents ''differentiation'', since Chaos differentiates (separates, divides) Tartarus and Earth.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = 'First of all': On the Semantics and Ethics of Hesiod's Cosmogony - Mitchell Miller - Ancient Philosophy (Philosophy Documentation Center)|url = https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=ancientphil&id=ancientphil_2001_0021_0002_0251_0276&onlyautologin=true|website = www.pdcnet.org|access-date = 2016-01-21|doi = 10.5840/ancientphil200121244|date = October 2001}}</ref> Even though Chaos is \"first of all\" for Hesiod, Miller argues that Tartarus represents the primacy of the ''undifferentiated,'' or the [[Apeiron (cosmology)|unlimited]]. Since undifferentiation is unthinkable, Chaos is the \"first of all\" in that he is the first ''thinkable'' being. In this way, Chaos (the principle of division) is the natural opposite of Eros (the principle of unification). Earth (light, day, waking, life) is the natural opposite of Tartarus (darkness, night, sleep, death). These four are the parents of all the other Titans.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Greece|Myths}}\n* [[Apate]]\n* [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)]]\n* ''[[Ex nihilo]]''\n* [[Geras]]\n* [[Oizys]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.theoi.com/greek-mythology/primeval-gods.html Theoi Project \u2013 Protogenoi]\n* [http://www.theoi.com/Tree1.html Theo Project \u2013 Protogenoi Family Tree]\n* [http://www.timelessmyths.com/classical/primeval.html Greek Primeval Deities]\n\n{{Greek mythology (deities)}}\n{{Greek religion}}\n\n[[Category:Ancient Greek religion|Primordial deities]]\n[[Category:Greek primordial deities| ]]\n[[Category:Mythology-related lists]]\n", "name_user": "62.174.145.170", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_primordial_deities"}
