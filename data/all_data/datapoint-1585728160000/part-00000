In spite of being a strong supporter of party leader [[John Bruton]], he remained on the backbenches for a number of years.\n\nIn 2001, discipline in the parliamentary party broke down and Coveney came out against Bruton in a leadership heave. His loss of support was a surprise and encouraged others to vote against Bruton. The subsequent [[2001 Fine Gael leadership election|leadership contest]] was won by [[Michael Noonan (Fine Gael politician)|Michael Noonan]] and a new front bench was put in place. Coveney was subsequently promoted to the position of deputy chief whip.\n\nCoveney was re-elected at the [[2002 Irish general election|2002 general election]], in what turned out to be a disaster for Fine Gael. The party lost twenty-three seats and some of its most important party figures.

He spearheaded the Stop the Traffic campaign at the European Parliament. He was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Delegation for Relations with the United States and a substitute on the Human Rights Subcommittee, Fisheries Committee, Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee and the Delegation for Relations with Iran.\n\n===Return to the D\u00e1il: 2007\u20132011===\nCoveney returned to Ireland to contest the [[2007 Irish general election|2007 general election]].

In spite of being a strong supporter of party leader [[John Bruton]], he remained on the backbenches for a number of years.\n\nIn 2001, discipline in the parliamentary party broke down and Coveney came out against Bruton in a leadership heave. His loss of support was a surprise and encouraged others to vote against Bruton. The subsequent [[2001 Fine Gael leadership election|leadership contest]] was won by [[Michael Noonan (Fine Gael politician)|Michael Noonan]] and a new front bench was put in place. Coveney was subsequently promoted to the position of deputy chief whip.\n\nCoveney was re-elected at the [[2002 Irish general election|2002 general election]], in what turned out to be a disaster for Fine Gael.
