The ammunition is also referred to as '''7.9mm ''Kurz''''' (''{{lang-de|Kurz}}'' meaning \"short\"), '''7.9 ''Kurz''''',  '''7.9mmK''', or '''8\u00d733 Polte'''. It was specifically intended for development of the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] ([[assault rifle]]). The round was developed as a compromise between the longer [[7.92\u00d757mm]] rifle and the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] pistol rounds, and is known as an [[Intermediate cartridges|intermediate cartridge]] ({{lang-de|Mittelpatrone}}).\n\n==Cartridge dimensions==\nThe 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz has a 2.22 ml (34.3 grain H<sub>2</sub>O) cartridge case capacity.\nThe exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in [[assault rifles]] under extreme conditions.\n\n[[File:7.92\u00d733mm Kurz.jpg|400px]]\n\n'''7.92\u00d733mm Kurz maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions'''. All sizes in millimeters (mm).\n\nAmericans define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 \u2248 17.5 degrees.\nThe common [[rifling]] [[twist rate]] for this cartridge is 240&nbsp;mm (1 in 9.45 in), four grooves, \u00d8 lands = {{convert|7.89|mm|in|3}}, \u00d8 grooves = {{convert|8.20|mm|in|3}}, land width = {{convert|4.40|mm|in|3}} and the [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|primer type]] is Berdan or boxer (in large rifle size).\n\nAccording to the official Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes \u00e0 Feu Portatives (C.I.P.)  rulings, the 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz can handle up to {{convert|340.00|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} P<sub>max</sub> piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle-cartridge combination has to be [[Proof (firearms)|proofed]] at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis means that 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries were, as of 2014, proof tested at {{convert|425.00|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} PE piezo pressure.\n\n== Military designation ==\nIn German military instructions, the [[caliber]] was often deemed unimportant; the name was emphasized. The 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated294\"/><ref name=\"Kopp\"/> was referred to as the {{lang|de|Pistolenpatrone M43}} (pistol cartridge model 1943) or {{lang|de|Pistolen-Munition M43}} (pistol ammunition model 1943). This was part of the same duplicity under which the StG44 was originally designated as a \"machine pistol\" to disguise the true nature of the weapon from Hitler. After the eventual approval and acceptance of the [[Sturmgewehr 44]], it was redesignated as the \"short cartridge model 1943\" ({{lang-de|Kurzpatrone 43}}).\n\n==Background==\nThe cartridge was the same caliber, and had the same base diameter, as the 7.92\u00d757mm,<ref name=\"MSA20th\"/> which was employed by the standard German Army [[infantry]] rifle, the [[Karabiner 98k]], as well as its [[machine gun]]s. The German armed forces had issued a 7.92\u00d757mm automatic ([[select fire]]) rifle, the [[FG 42]], in limited numbers, but the heavy recoil of the round made it difficult to use effectively in this role.\n\nWhat was needed was a cartridge that could be used in a lighter, more maneuverable rifle to bridge the gap between [[submachine gun]]s and rifles. The standard issue 7.92\u00d757mm cartridge case was shortened by {{convert|24|mm|in}}. With a case length of {{convert|33|mm|in}}, the Kurz round was substantially shorter and delivered less recoil than full-length 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser ammunition, but was still almost as effective when engaging targets at typical combat ranges of {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on|0}}. This meant it could be fired effectively from a weapon that weighed less than a machine gun, yet still had much greater range, velocity, and stopping power than the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum which was standard in German submachine guns. The weight of the 7.92mm Kurz S.m.E. round was {{convert|17.05|g|gr}}, with the bullet taking up {{convert|8.1|g|gr}} and the cartridge and propellant the remaining {{convert|8.95|g|gr}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte-k.htg/draw02.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107113420/http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte-k.htg/draw02.jpg |archive-date=2015-11-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The 34% weight reduction compared to full-length 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser s.S. ball ammunition meant that a soldier could carry more rounds of ammunition, for sustained [[suppressive fire]].\n\nThe shortage of brass in the later stages of World War II led to the use of steel cases for this new cartridge. The Kurz cartridge incorporated more taper than the parent case because steel is less elastic than brass and more difficult to extract (and because the cartridge retained the same base diameter and caliber as the longer, full size round, requiring a more abrupt taper). This led to the distinctive curved [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] for weapons that used this cartridge, which became popularly known as \"banana clips\", due to their curved shape, and which can be seen on other weapons using distinctly tapered cartridges, like the [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] rifles. The steel cases were typically [[lacquer]]-coated to prevent corrosion.\n\n==Firearms==\nPrior to the development of the Kurz round and its associated weapons, two basic small arms existed to equip the regular infantryman, the [[bolt-action rifle]] and the submachine gun. The bolt-action rifle was the standard small arm for most of the world's armies, usually incorporating good accuracy and stopping power, but with a very limited [[rate of fire]]. The submachine gun was a newer piece of equipment, which offered a very high rate of fire, and a compact size, but was of very limited range and stopping power due to the pistol round (usually 9&nbsp;mm) it fired. While the Kurz round did not match the range and accuracy of a full power round fired by a traditional bolt-action rifle, it could still engage individual targets out to {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on|0}}. As an effective, intermediate-sized cartridge, the Kurz round was a key evolution in the development of the assault rifle by providing a combination of controllable automatic fire and acceptable accuracy at ranges most likely to see infantry combat.<ref name=\"janesrecog\">Jane's Guns Recognition Guide, Ian Hogg & Terry Gander, HarperCollins Publisher, 2005, p.287</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt07/stg44-assault-rifle.html |title=Machine Carbine Promoted: MP43 Is Now Assault Rifle StG44, WWII Tactical and Technical Trends, No. 57, April 1945 |publisher=Lone Sentry |date=2007-05-10 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}</ref><ref>Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, 2000 by Ian V.

The first [[FN FAL]] prototype was designed to fire the cartridge when NATO was organized. After the war it was manufactured by [[East Germany]] (the German Democratic Republic), the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], and Egypt.\n\nSpain continued development after the war, creating a few variants of the cartridge, such as tracer rounds, boat-tailed rounds and slightly shorter bullets that have a lead core. These developments were encouraged by Calzada Bayo, a Spanish lieutenant colonel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://claus.espeholt.dk/spa_kurz.html |title=The Spanish kurz |publisher=Claus.espeholt.dk |date=1952-12-18 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref> However, they were cancelled in favour of a more radical cartridge, [[7.92\u00d740mm]] CETME.

It is used in locally made AK-pattern weapons in semi-automatic only (produced or converted in Peshawer, Kohat and Derra Adam Khel, etc.) that chamber this cartridge, since [[7.62\u00d739mm]] is a restricted caliber (known as \"prohibited bore\" or \"PB\" in Pakistan).

All sizes in millimeters (mm).\n\nAmericans define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 \u2248 17.5 degrees.\nThe common [[rifling]] [[twist rate]] for this cartridge is 240&nbsp;mm (1 in 9.45 in), four grooves, \u00d8 lands = {{convert|7.89|mm|in|3}}, \u00d8 grooves = {{convert|8.20|mm|in|3}}, land width = {{convert|4.40|mm|in|3}} and the [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|primer type]] is Berdan or boxer (in large rifle size).\n\nAccording to the official Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes \u00e0 Feu Portatives (C.I.P.)  rulings, the 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz can handle up to {{convert|340.00|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} P<sub>max</sub> piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle-cartridge combination has to be [[Proof (firearms)|proofed]] at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis means that 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries were, as of 2014, proof tested at {{convert|425.00|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} PE piezo pressure.\n\n== Military designation ==\nIn German military instructions, the [[caliber]] was often deemed unimportant; the name was emphasized. The 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated294\"/><ref name=\"Kopp\"/> was referred to as the {{lang|de|Pistolenpatrone M43}} (pistol cartridge model 1943) or {{lang|de|Pistolen-Munition M43}} (pistol ammunition model 1943). This was part of the same duplicity under which the StG44 was originally designated as a \"machine pistol\" to disguise the true nature of the weapon from Hitler. After the eventual approval and acceptance of the [[Sturmgewehr 44]], it was redesignated as the \"short cartridge model 1943\" ({{lang-de|Kurzpatrone 43}}).\n\n==Background==\nThe cartridge was the same caliber, and had the same base diameter, as the 7.92\u00d757mm,<ref name=\"MSA20th\"/> which was employed by the standard German Army [[infantry]] rifle, the [[Karabiner 98k]], as well as its [[machine gun]]s. The German armed forces had issued a 7.92\u00d757mm automatic ([[select fire]]) rifle, the [[FG 42]], in limited numbers, but the heavy recoil of the round made it difficult to use effectively in this role.\n\nWhat was needed was a cartridge that could be used in a lighter, more maneuverable rifle to bridge the gap between [[submachine gun]]s and rifles. The standard issue 7.92\u00d757mm cartridge case was shortened by {{convert|24|mm|in}}. With a case length of {{convert|33|mm|in}}, the Kurz round was substantially shorter and delivered less recoil than full-length 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser ammunition, but was still almost as effective when engaging targets at typical combat ranges of {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on|0}}. This meant it could be fired effectively from a weapon that weighed less than a machine gun, yet still had much greater range, velocity, and stopping power than the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum which was standard in German submachine guns. The weight of the 7.92mm Kurz S.m.E. round was {{convert|17.05|g|gr}}, with the bullet taking up {{convert|8.1|g|gr}} and the cartridge and propellant the remaining {{convert|8.95|g|gr}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte-k.htg/draw02.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107113420/http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte-k.htg/draw02.jpg |archive-date=2015-11-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The 34% weight reduction compared to full-length 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser s.S. ball ammunition meant that a soldier could carry more rounds of ammunition, for sustained [[suppressive fire]].\n\nThe shortage of brass in the later stages of World War II led to the use of steel cases for this new cartridge. The Kurz cartridge incorporated more taper than the parent case because steel is less elastic than brass and more difficult to extract (and because the cartridge retained the same base diameter and caliber as the longer, full size round, requiring a more abrupt taper). This led to the distinctive curved [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] for weapons that used this cartridge, which became popularly known as \"banana clips\", due to their curved shape, and which can be seen on other weapons using distinctly tapered cartridges, like the [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] rifles. The steel cases were typically [[lacquer]]-coated to prevent corrosion.\n\n==Firearms==\nPrior to the development of the Kurz round and its associated weapons, two basic small arms existed to equip the regular infantryman, the [[bolt-action rifle]] and the submachine gun. The bolt-action rifle was the standard small arm for most of the world's armies, usually incorporating good accuracy and stopping power, but with a very limited [[rate of fire]]. The submachine gun was a newer piece of equipment, which offered a very high rate of fire, and a compact size, but was of very limited range and stopping power due to the pistol round (usually 9&nbsp;mm) it fired. While the Kurz round did not match the range and accuracy of a full power round fired by a traditional bolt-action rifle, it could still engage individual targets out to {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on|0}}. As an effective, intermediate-sized cartridge, the Kurz round was a key evolution in the development of the assault rifle by providing a combination of controllable automatic fire and acceptable accuracy at ranges most likely to see infantry combat.<ref name=\"janesrecog\">Jane's Guns Recognition Guide, Ian Hogg & Terry Gander, HarperCollins Publisher, 2005, p.287</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt07/stg44-assault-rifle.html |title=Machine Carbine Promoted: MP43 Is Now Assault Rifle StG44, WWII Tactical and Technical Trends, No. 57, April 1945 |publisher=Lone Sentry |date=2007-05-10 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}</ref><ref>Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, 2000 by Ian V.

After the war it was manufactured by [[East Germany]] (the German Democratic Republic), the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], and Egypt.\n\nSpain continued development after the war, creating a few variants of the cartridge, such as tracer rounds, boat-tailed rounds and slightly shorter bullets that have a lead core. These developments were encouraged by Calzada Bayo, a Spanish lieutenant colonel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://claus.espeholt.dk/spa_kurz.html |title=The Spanish kurz |publisher=Claus.espeholt.dk |date=1952-12-18 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref> However, they were cancelled in favour of a more radical cartridge, [[7.92\u00d740mm]] CETME.

It is used in locally made AK-pattern weapons in semi-automatic only (produced or converted in Peshawer, Kohat and Derra Adam Khel, etc.) that chamber this cartridge, since [[7.62\u00d739mm]] is a restricted caliber (known as \"prohibited bore\" or \"PB\" in Pakistan).
