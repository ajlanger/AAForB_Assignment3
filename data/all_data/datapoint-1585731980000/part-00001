In 1990, Dar recorded her first album, ''I Have No History'', produced by Jeannie Deva and engineered by Rob Lehmann at Oak Grove Studios in [[Malden, Massachusetts]]. One year later in 1991, Dar recorded her second album, ''All My Heroes Are Dead'', most of which was recorded at Wellspring Sound in Newton, MA. This album included Dar's song \"Mark Rothko Song.\" The original recording of this song was later included in her third album ''The Honesty Room''. In 1993 Williams moved to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. Early in Williams's music career, she opened for [[Joan Baez]], who would make her relatively well known by recording some of her songs (Williams also dueted with Baez on ''[[Ring Them Bells]]'').  Her growing popularity has since relied heavily on community coffeehouses, [[public radio]], and an extensive fan base on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nWilliams recorded her first full album, ''[[The Honesty Room]],'' under her own label, Burning Field Music.  Guest artists included [[the Nields|Nerissa and Katryna Nields]], Max Cohen and [[Gideon Freudmann]].  The album was briefly distributed by Chicago-based [[Waterbug Records]]. Williams soon secured a licensing-and-distribution deal for Burning Field with Razor and Tie, and in 1995 reissued the album on that label, with two re-recorded bonus tracks. The record went on to become one  of the top-selling independent folk albums of the year.   1996's ''[[Mortal City]]'', also licensed and distributed with Razor and Tie, received substantial notice, partially due to the fact that it coincided with her tour with Baez.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  The album again featured guest appearances by the Nields sisters and Freudmann, as well as noted folk artists [[John Prine]], [[Cliff Eberhardt]] and [[Lucy Kaplansky]].  With that success, Razor & Tie re-released ''The Honesty Room''.  By the time of her third release, ''[[End of The Summer]]'' (1997), Williams's career had gathered substantial momentum, and the album did remarkably well{{Specify|date=April 2009}}, given its genre and independent label status.\n\nIn 1998, Williams, [[Richard Shindell]] and [[Lucy Kaplansky]] formed the  group [[Cry Cry Cry (band)|Cry Cry Cry]] as a way to pay homage to some of their favorite folk artists.  The band released an eponymous album of covers and toured from 1998 to 2000.

On the track \"Anthem\" on her early tape ''[[All My Heroes Are Dead]]'', she sang, \"I know there's blood in the pavement and we've turned the fields to sand.\"\n\nWilliams' songs often address gender typing, [[gender roles|roles]], and inequities.  \"You're Aging Well\" on ''[[The Honesty Room]]'' discusses adolescent body image, [[ageism]] and [[self-loathing]] in detail.  The song ends with the singer finding an unnamed female mentor &mdash; \"the woman of voices\" &mdash; who points her toward a more enlightened and mature point of view.

Throughout the song, the family members begin to discover their differences need not estrange them from one another.\n\nIn an interview in 2007 on the Food Is Not Love [[podcast]], she said that the song \"February\" from ''Mortal City'' is one of her songs that she likes best.

In 1990, Dar recorded her first album, \"I Have No History\" produced by Jeannie Deva and engineered by Rob Lehmann at Oak Grove Studios in [[Malden, Massachusetts]]. One year later in 1991, Dar recorded her second album, \"All My Heroes Are Dead\" most of which was recorded at Wellspring Sound in Newton, MA. This album included Dar's song: \"Mark Rothko Song.\" The original recording production of this song was later included in her third album \"The Honesty Room.\"\nIn 1993 Williams moved to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]].\nEarly in Williams's music career, she opened for [[Joan Baez]], who would make her relatively well known by recording some of her songs (Williams also dueted with Baez on ''[[Ring Them Bells]]'').  Her growing popularity has since relied heavily on community coffeehouses, [[public radio]], and an extensive fan base on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nWilliams recorded her first full album, ''[[The Honesty Room]],'' under her own label, Burning Field Music.  Guest artists included [[the Nields|Nerissa and Katryna Nields]], Max Cohen and [[Gideon Freudmann]].  The album was briefly distributed by Chicago-based [[Waterbug Records]]. Williams soon secured a licensing-and-distribution deal for Burning Field with Razor and Tie, and in 1995 reissued the album on that label, with two re-recorded bonus tracks. The record went on to become one  of the top-selling independent folk albums of the year.   1996's ''[[Mortal City]]'', also licensed and distributed with Razor and Tie, received substantial notice, partially due to the fact that it coincided with her tour with Baez.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  The album again featured guest appearances by the Nields sisters and Freudmann, as well as noted folk artists [[John Prine]], [[Cliff Eberhardt]] and [[Lucy Kaplansky]].  With that success, Razor & Tie re-released ''The Honesty Room''.  By the time of her third release, ''[[End of The Summer]]'' (1997), Williams' career had gathered substantial momentum, and the album did remarkably well{{Specify|date=April 2009}}, given its genre and independent label status.\n\nIn 1998, Williams, [[Richard Shindell]] and [[Lucy Kaplansky]] formed the  group [[Cry Cry Cry (band)|Cry Cry Cry]] as a way to pay homage to some of their favorite folk artists.  The band released an eponymous album of covers and toured from 1998 to 2000. In June 2017, Cry Cry Cry reunited for the first time to play at the Clearwater Festival in New York.<ref name=\"clearwater\">{{cite news | first=Joan | last=Vos Macdonald | title=Cry Cry Cry Fans Get The Reunion They Hoped For At Clearwater| url=https://patch.com/new-york/harrison/cry-cry-cry-fans-get-reunion-they-hoped-clearwater | publisher=Patch| date= June 1, 2017| accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nShe has since released six more studio albums on the Razor & Tie label (''[[The Green World]]'' (2000; which included \"Spring Street\", based on [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]] in [[SoHo]] in [[Manhattan]]),<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/music/00/09/14/DAR_WILLIAMS.html\n |title=Folk tales; Dar Williams gets to heart of The Green World\n |author=Wayne Robins\n |publisher=Bostonphoenix.com\n |date=September 14\u201321, 2000\n |accessdate=February 4, 2013\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195203/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/music/00/09/14/DAR_WILLIAMS.html\n |archivedate=March 4, 2016\n \n}}</ref> ''[[The Beauty of the Rain]]'' (2003), ''[[My Better Self]]'' (2005), ''[[Promised Land (Dar Williams album)|Promised Land]]'' (2008)), ''[[Many Great Companions]]'' (2010), and ''[[In the Time of Gods]]'' (2012), as well as two live albums (''[[Out There Live]]'' (2001) and ''[[Live at Bearsville Theater]]'' (2007)).\n\nWilliams has lent her talent and support to various causes, founding the Snowden Environmental Trust and taking part in many benefit concerts.

She doesn't force herself to write, which is an approach she learned in college when she decided that whatever she could do at any given time was enough. She prides herself on having songs that all came from some kind of inspiration.\n\nWilliams wants her music to be an \"efficient career,\" something she can do her entire life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  She strives to accomplish this by \"continuously court[ing] your [[muse]]; to keep writing stuff that feels risky about things you believe in, that you're really feeling.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n==Songs==\n[[File:Dar Williams July 2008a.jpg|alt=|thumb|Williams onstage in 2008]]\nRecurrent themes in Williams's songs include [[religion]], [[adolescence]], [[gender]] issues, [[anti-commercialism]], misunderstood relationships, [[Grief|loss]], [[humor]], and geography.\n\nWilliams' early work spoke clearly of her upbringing in 1970s and 80s [[suburbia]] \u2013 of [[Social alienation|alienation]], and the [[hypocrisy]] evident in the [[Post-World War II baby boom|post-WWII]] [[middle class]]. On the track \"Anthem\" on her early tape ''[[All My Heroes Are Dead]]'', she sang, \"I know there's blood in the pavement and we've turned the fields to sand.\"\n\nWilliams' songs often address gender typing, [[gender roles|roles]], and inequities.  \"You're Aging Well\" on ''[[The Honesty Room]]'' discusses adolescent body image, [[ageism]] and [[self-loathing]] in detail.  The song ends with the singer finding an unnamed female mentor &mdash; \"the woman of voices\" &mdash; who points her toward a more enlightened and mature point of view. [[Joan Baez]] covered the song in concert and later dueted with Williams on tours.<ref>{{cite news | title= Joan Baez and Dar Williams Interviewed by Liane Hansen| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-28472063.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218200643/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-28472063.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=December 18, 2006| publisher=NPR\u2019s Weekend Edition Sunday | date=October 8, 1995 }}</ref>\n\nA 2001 article in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''<ref>{{cite web |author=Gail Cohen |url=http://darwilliams.net/library/advocate6-11-01.html |title=Dar to be different |publisher=Darwilliams.net |date=November 6, 2001 |accessdate=August 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819161743/http://darwilliams.net/library/advocate6-11-01.html |archivedate=August 19, 2012  }}</ref> discussed Williams' popularity among [[LGBT]] people, writing that among LGBT-supportive straight songwriters, \"few manage in their lyrics to dig as deeply or as authentically as...

Throughout the song, the family members begin to discover their differences need not estrange them from one another.\n\nIn an interview in 2007 on the Food Is Not Love [[podcast]], she said that the song \"February\" from ''Mortal City'' is one of her songs that she likes best.  She referred to the way the song \"kept on evolving into, not only what I wanted to say, but what I wanted to say and didn't even know was in there.\"  She liked the way the song \"kept on breaking its own rules in a way that art is all about.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foodisnotlove.podomatic.com/entry/2007-03-19T18_42_52-07_00 |title=Food Is Not Love podcast |accessdate=March 21, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707215847/http://foodisnotlove.podomatic.com/entry/2007-03-19T18_42_52-07_00 |archivedate=July 7, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nWilliams' relationship with her family is hinted at through several songs, including \"After All\" on ''[[The Green World]]''.
