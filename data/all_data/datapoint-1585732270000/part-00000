Sometimes, these associated extra-intestinal symptoms are the initial signs of the disease, such as painful arthritic knees in teenagers, which also may be seen in adults. A diagnosis of UC may not occur until the onset of intestinal manifestations, however.{{mcn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Extent of involvement====\n[[File:Intestine-diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of the human intestine]]\nUlcerative colitis is normally continuous from the rectum up the colon.

Mild abdominal pain or cramping may occur. People with UC may believe they are [[constipation|constipated]] when in fact they are experiencing [[Rectal tenesmus|tenesmus]], which is a constant feeling of the need to empty the bowel accompanied by involuntary straining efforts, pain, and cramping with little or no fecal output. Rectal pain is uncommon.{{mcn|date=December 2019}}\n*Moderate disease correlates with more than four stools daily, but with minimal signs of toxicity. People may display anemia (not requiring transfusions), moderate abdominal pain, and low-grade [[fever]], {{convert|38|to|39|C|F}}.\n*Severe disease correlates with more than six bloody stools a day or observable massive and significant bloody bowel movement, and evidence of toxicity as demonstrated by fever, [[tachycardia]], anemia or an elevated ESR or CRP.\n*Fulminant disease correlates with more than 10 bowel movements daily, continuous bleeding, toxicity, abdominal tenderness and distension, blood transfusion requirement, and colonic dilation (expansion). People in this category may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired colonic motility and leading to [[toxic megacolon]]. If the [[serous membrane]] is involved, a colonic perforation may ensue.

Human colonic mucosa is maintained by the colonic epithelial barrier and immune cells in the lamina propria (see [[intestinal mucosal barrier]]). N-butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, gets oxidized through the [[beta oxidation]] pathway into carbon dioxide and ketone bodies. It has been shown that N-butyrate helps supply nutrients to this epithelial barrier. Studies have proposed that hydrogen sulfide plays a role in impairing this beta-oxidation pathway by interrupting the short chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme within the pathway. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the protective benefit of smoking in ulcerative colitis is due to the [[hydrogen cyanide]] from cigarette smoke reacting with hydrogen sulfide to produce the non-toxic isothiocyanate, thereby inhibiting sulfides from interrupting the pathway.<ref name=Levine>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levine J, Ellis CJ, Furne JK, Springfield J, Levitt MD | title = Fecal hydrogen sulfide production in ulcerative colitis | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 83\u20137 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9448181 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.1998.083_c.x | df = dmy-all | doi-broken-date = 2020-03-01 }}</ref> An unrelated study suggested that the sulfur contained in red meats and alcohol may lead to an increased risk of relapse for people in remission.<ref name=Roediger/>\n\nPeople with ulcerative colitis typically present with rectal bleeding, diarrhea, tenesmus (urgent desire to evacuate the bowels but with the passage of little stool), and lower abdominal pain. The severity of disease at clinical presentation is important in determining the appropriate therapy. Peoples with mildly active disease will have fewer than 4 bowel movements daily and no signs of toxicity. Individuals with moderate-severity UC have more frequent bowel movements with bleeding. Approximately 70% of people with ulcerative colitis will have moderately active disease at presentation. People with severely active disease will have signs of toxicity with fever, tachycardia, and anemia. People with fulminant or toxic colitis or toxic megacolon often have more than 10 bowel movements in a day, continuous bleeding, abdominal distention and tenderness, and radiologic evidence of edema and, in some cases, bowel dilation. These people most often require immediate [[colectomy]] because 10% have perforated colon at the time of surgery.{{mcn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[Image:Ulcerative colitis (2) active.jpg|thumb|H&E stain of a colonic biopsy showing a crypt abscess, a classic finding in ulcerative colitis]]\nThe initial [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] workup for ulcerative colitis includes the following:<ref name=ACGGuideline>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kornbluth A, Sachar DB | title = Ulcerative colitis practice guidelines in adults (update): American College of Gastroenterology, Practice Parameters Committee | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 99 | issue = 7 | pages = 1371\u201385 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15233681 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2004.40036.x | doi-broken-date = 2020-03-01 }}</ref><ref name=emed2336>{{eMedicine|med|2336|Ulcerative colitis}}</ref>\n\n* A [[complete blood count]] is done to check for anemia; [[thrombocytosis]], a high [[platelet]] count, is occasionally seen\n* [[Electrolyte]] studies and [[renal function|kidney function tests]] are done, as chronic diarrhea may be associated with [[hypokalemia]], [[hypomagnesemia]] and pre-kidney failure.\n* [[Liver function tests]] are performed to screen for bile duct involvement: [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]].\n* [[X-ray]]\n* [[Urinalysis]]\n* Stool culture, to rule out parasites and infectious causes.\n* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be measured, with an elevated sedimentation rate indicating that an inflammatory process is present.\n* [[C-reactive protein]] can be measured, with an elevated level being another indication of inflammation.\n* [[Sigmoidoscopy]] a type of endoscopy which can detect the presence of ulcers in the rectum and lower section of the large intestine.\n*[[Colonoscopy]] a type of endoscopy which can the full length of the large intestine and end of the [[small intestine]] ([[ileum]]).\n\nAlthough ulcerative colitis is a disease of unknown causation, inquiry should be made as to unusual factors believed to trigger the disease.<ref name=ACGGuideline/>\n\nThe [[simple clinical colitis activity index]] was created in 1998 and is used to assess the severity of symptoms.<ref name=\"WalmsleyAyres1998\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walmsley RS, Ayres RC, Pounder RE, Allan RN | title = A simple clinical colitis activity index | journal = Gut | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 29\u201332 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9771402 | pmc = 1727189 | doi = 10.1136/gut.43.1.29 }}</ref><!-- please retain this historical, non-MEDRS citation --><ref name=\"MardiniGrigorian2014\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mardini HE, Grigorian AY | title = Probiotic mix VSL#3 is effective adjunctive therapy for mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis: a meta-analysis | journal = Inflammatory Bowel Diseases | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1562\u20137 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24918321 | doi = 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000084 }}</ref>\n\n===Endoscopic===\n[[Image:Ulcerative colitis (2) endoscopic biopsy.jpg|thumb|Biopsy sample ([[H&E stain]]) that demonstrates marked [[lymphocyte|lymphocytic]] infiltration (blue/purple) of the [[intestinal mucosa]] and architectural distortion of the crypts.]]\nThe best test for diagnosis of ulcerative colitis remains [[endoscopy]].

The goal is to induce remission initially with medications, followed by the administration of maintenance medications to prevent a relapse. The concept of induction of remission and maintenance of remission is very important. The medications used to induce and maintain a remission somewhat overlap, but the treatments are different. Physicians first direct treatment to inducing remission, which involves relief of symptoms and mucosal healing of the colon's lining, and then longer-term treatment to maintain remission and prevent complications.

In rare cases, the extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease may require removal of the colon \u2013 although this does not necessarily resolve these symptoms.<ref name=ACGGuideline/>\n\nThe removal of the entire large intestine, know as a [[proctocolectomy]], results in a permanent ileostomy \u2013 where a [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] is created by pulling the terminal ileum through the abdomen. Intestinal contents are emptied into a removable [[Ostomy pouching system|ostomy bag]] which is secured around the stoma using adhesive.\n\nAnother surgical option for ulcerative colitis that is affecting most of the large bowel is called the [[ileo-anal pouch|ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA)]]. This is a two- or three-step procedure. In a three-step procedure, the first surgery is a [[Subtotal colectomy|sub-total colectomy]], in which the large bowel is removed, but the rectum remains in situ, and a temporary ileostomy is made. The second step is a [[proctecomy]] and formation of the ileal pouch (commonly known as a \"j-pouch\"). This involves removing the large majority of the remaining rectal stump and creating a new \"rectum\" by fashioning the end of the small intestine into a pouch and attaching it to the anus. After this procedure, a new type of ileostomy is created (known as a loop ileostomy) to allow the anastomoses to heal. The final surgery is a take-down procedure where the ileostomy is reversed and there is no longer the need for an ostomy bag. When done in two steps, a proctocolectomy \u2013 removing both the colon and rectum \u2013 is performed alongside the pouch formation and loop ileostomy. The final step is the same take-down surgery as in the three-step procedure. Time taken between each step can vary, but typically a six- to twelve-month interval is recommended between the first two steps, and a minimum of two to three months is required between the formation of the pouch and the ileostomy take-down.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile the ileal pouch procedure removes the need for an ostomy bag, it does not restore normal bowel function. In the months following the final operation, patients typically experience 8\u201315 bowel movements a day. Overtime this number decreases, with many patients reporting four-six bowel movements after one year post-op. While many patients have success with this procedure, there are a number of known complications. [[Pouchitis]], inflammation of the ileal pouch resulting in symptoms similar to ulcerative colitis, is relatively common. Pouchitis can be acute, remitting, or chronic however treatment using antibiotics, steroids, or biologics can be highly effective. Other complications include fistulas, abbesses, and pouch failure. Depending on the severity of the condition, pouch revision surgery may need to be performed. In some cased the pouch may need to be de-functioned or removed and an ileostomy recreated.<ref>{{cite web |title=Colectomy Not a Final Cure for Ulcerative Colitis, Data Show |url=https://www.mdedge.com/internalmedicine/article/11622/gastroenterology/colectomy-not-final-cure-ulcerative-colitis-data |website=www.mdedge.com |accessdate=15 December 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pappou|first=Emmanouil P.|last2=Kiran|first2=Ravi P.|date=June 2016|title=The Failed J Pouch|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4882179/|journal=Clinics in Colon and Rectal Surgery|volume=29|issue=2|pages=123\u2013129|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1580724|issn=1531-0043|pmc=4882179|pmid=27247537}}</ref>\n\n=== Leukocyte apheresis ===\nA type of [[leukocyte apheresis]], known as granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis, still requires large-scale trials to determine whether or not it is effective.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Abreu MT, Plevy S, Sands BE, Weinstein R | title = Selective leukocyte apheresis for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease | journal = Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | pages = 874\u201388 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18090155 | doi = 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3180479435 }}</ref> Results from small trials have been tentatively positive.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vernia P, D'Ovidio V, Meo D | title = Leukocytapheresis in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: Current position and perspectives | journal = Transfusion and Apheresis Science | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 227\u20139 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20817610 | doi = 10.1016/j.transci.2010.07.023 }}</ref>\n\n===Bacterial recolonization===\n* In a number of randomized clinical trials, [[probiotics]] have demonstrated the potential to be helpful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

People with UC may believe they are [[constipation|constipated]] when in fact they are experiencing [[Rectal tenesmus|tenesmus]], which is a constant feeling of the need to empty the bowel accompanied by involuntary straining efforts, pain, and cramping with little or no fecal output. Rectal pain is uncommon.{{mcn|date=December 2019}}\n*Moderate disease correlates with more than four stools daily, but with minimal signs of toxicity.

People in this category may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired colonic motility and leading to [[toxic megacolon]].

N-butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, gets oxidized through the [[beta oxidation]] pathway into carbon dioxide and ketone bodies. It has been shown that N-butyrate helps supply nutrients to this epithelial barrier. Studies have proposed that hydrogen sulfide plays a role in impairing this beta-oxidation pathway by interrupting the short chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme within the pathway.

In some cases, however, it may not be possible to tell the difference, in which case the disease is classified as indeterminate colitis.{{mcn|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{Findings in CD vs. UC}}\n\n==Management==\n{{Main|Management of ulcerative colitis}}\nStandard treatment for ulcerative colitis depends on the extent of involvement and disease severity. The goal is to induce remission initially with medications, followed by the administration of maintenance medications to prevent a relapse. The concept of induction of remission and maintenance of remission is very important. The medications used to induce and maintain a remission somewhat overlap, but the treatments are different. Physicians first direct treatment to inducing remission, which involves relief of symptoms and mucosal healing of the colon's lining, and then longer-term treatment to maintain remission and prevent complications. Acute severe ulcerative colitis requires hospitalisation, exclusion of infections, and [[corticosteroids]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen JH, Andrews JM, Kariyawasam V, Moran N, Gounder P, Collins G, Walsh AJ, Connor S, Lee TW, Koh CE, Chang J, Paramsothy S, Tattersall S, Lemberg DA, Radford-Smith G, Lawrance IC, McLachlan A, Moore GT, Corte C, Katelaris P, Leong RW | title = Review article: acute severe ulcerative colitis - evidence-based consensus statements | journal = Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 127\u201344 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27226344 | doi = 10.1111/apt.13670 }}</ref>\n\nFor acute stages of the disease, a [[Low-fiber/low-residue diet|low fiber diet]] may be recommended.<ref name=webmd>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/ibd-crohns-disease/low-residue-diet-foods#2|title=Should You Try a Low-Residue Diet?|publisher=WebMD|website=WebMD|date=October 25, 2016|access-date=April 29, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316150550/http://www.webmd.com/ibd-crohns-disease/low-residue-diet-foods#2|archive-date=16 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=manual_cnm>{{cite book|title=Manual of Clinical Nutrition Management|publisher=Compass Group|date=2013|url=http://bscn2k15.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/9/2/12924787/manual_of_clinical_nutrition2013.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129172958/http://bscn2k15.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/9/2/12924787/manual_of_clinical_nutrition2013.pdf|archive-date=29 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Medication===\nUlcerative colitis can be treated with a number of medications, including 5-ASA drugs such as [[sulfasalazine]] and [[mesalazine]].

Surgery is also indicated for people with severe colitis or toxic megacolon. People with symptoms that are disabling and do not respond to drugs may wish to consider whether surgery would improve the quality of life.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nUlcerative colitis affects many parts of the body outside the intestinal tract. In rare cases, the extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease may require removal of the colon \u2013 although this does not necessarily resolve these symptoms.<ref name=ACGGuideline/>\n\nThe removal of the entire large intestine, know as a [[proctocolectomy]], results in a permanent ileostomy \u2013 where a [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] is created by pulling the terminal ileum through the abdomen. Intestinal contents are emptied into a removable [[Ostomy pouching system|ostomy bag]] which is secured around the stoma using adhesive.\n\nAnother surgical option for ulcerative colitis that is affecting most of the large bowel is called the [[ileo-anal pouch|ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA)]]. This is a two- or three-step procedure. In a three-step procedure, the first surgery is a [[Subtotal colectomy|sub-total colectomy]], in which the large bowel is removed, but the rectum remains in situ, and a temporary ileostomy is made. The second step is a [[proctecomy]] and formation of the ileal pouch (commonly known as a \"j-pouch\"). This involves removing the large majority of the remaining rectal stump and creating a new \"rectum\" by fashioning the end of the small intestine into a pouch and attaching it to the anus. After this procedure, a new type of ileostomy is created (known as a loop ileostomy) to allow the anastomoses to heal. The final surgery is a take-down procedure where the ileostomy is reversed and there is no longer the need for an ostomy bag. When done in two steps, a proctocolectomy \u2013 removing both the colon and rectum \u2013 is performed alongside the pouch formation and loop ileostomy. The final step is the same take-down surgery as in the three-step procedure. Time taken between each step can vary, but typically a six- to twelve-month interval is recommended between the first two steps, and a minimum of two to three months is required between the formation of the pouch and the ileostomy take-down.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile the ileal pouch procedure removes the need for an ostomy bag, it does not restore normal bowel function. In the months following the final operation, patients typically experience 8-15 bowel movements a day. Overtime this number decreases, with many patients reporting four-six bowel movements after one year post-op. While many patients have success with this procedure, there are a number of known complications. [[Pouchitis]], inflammation of the ileal pouch resulting in symptoms similar to ulcerative colitis, is relatively common. Pouchitis can be acute, remitting, or chronic however treatment using antibiotics, steroids, or biologics can be highly effective. Other complications include fistulas, abbesses, and pouch failure. Depending on the severity of the condition, pouch revision surgery may need to be performed. In some cased the pouch may need to be de-functioned or removed and an ileostomy recreated.<ref>{{cite web |title=Colectomy Not a Final Cure for Ulcerative Colitis, Data Show |url=https://www.mdedge.com/internalmedicine/article/11622/gastroenterology/colectomy-not-final-cure-ulcerative-colitis-data |website=www.mdedge.com |accessdate=15 December 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pappou|first=Emmanouil P.|last2=Kiran|first2=Ravi P.|date=June 2016|title=The Failed J Pouch|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4882179/|journal=Clinics in Colon and Rectal Surgery|volume=29|issue=2|pages=123\u2013129|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1580724|issn=1531-0043|pmc=4882179|pmid=27247537}}</ref>\n\n=== Leukocyte apheresis ===\nA type of [[leukocyte apheresis]], known as granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis, still requires large-scale trials to determine whether or not it is effective.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Abreu MT, Plevy S, Sands BE, Weinstein R | title = Selective leukocyte apheresis for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease | journal = Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | pages = 874\u201388 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18090155 | doi = 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3180479435 }}</ref> Results from small trials have been tentatively positive.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vernia P, D'Ovidio V, Meo D | title = Leukocytapheresis in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: Current position and perspectives | journal = Transfusion and Apheresis Science | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 227\u20139 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20817610 | doi = 10.1016/j.transci.2010.07.023 }}</ref>\n\n===Bacterial recolonization===\n* In a number of randomized clinical trials, [[probiotics]] have demonstrated the potential to be helpful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
