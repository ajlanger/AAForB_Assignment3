Various studies have placed it at 9.4\u20139.6 on the [[moment magnitude scale]]. It occurred in the afternoon (19:11 [[GMT]], 15:11 local time), and lasted approximately 10 minutes. The resulting [[tsunami]] affected southern Chile, [[Hawaii]], [[Japan]], the [[Philippines]], eastern [[New Zealand]], southeast [[Australia]], and the [[Aleutian Islands]].\n\nThe [[epicenter]] of this [[megathrust earthquake]] was near [[Lumaco]], approximately {{convert|570|km|mi}} south of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], with [[Valdivia]] being the most affected city. The tremor caused localised tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to {{convert|25|m}}. The main tsunami traveled across the Pacific Ocean and devastated [[Hilo, Hawaii]]. Waves as high as {{convert|10.7|m}} were recorded {{convert|10000|km|mi}} from the epicenter, and as far away as Japan and the Philippines.\n\nThe death toll and monetary losses arising from this widespread disaster are not certain.<ref>{{cite video | year =1960 | title =Video: Cataclysm.

Many [[city block]]s with destroyed buildings in the city center remained empty until the 1990s and 2000s, with some of them still used as [[parking lot]]s.
