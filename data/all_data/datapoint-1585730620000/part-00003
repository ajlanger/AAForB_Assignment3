[[Granada Television]] produced the series for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network.\n\n==Plot==\nThe serial opens in the midst of [[World War II]] in the fictional Indian city of Mayapore, against the backdrop of the last years of the [[British Raj]] and the [[Indian independence movement]]. Hari Kumar is a young Indian man who was educated at Chillingborough, a [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|British public school]] (the British term for an elite [[private school]]); he identifies as [[English people|English]] rather than Indian. The bankruptcy of his father, a formerly successful businessman, forces him to return to India to live with his aunt.\n\nWorking as a journalist, Kumar now occupies a lower social status in India, and lives between two worlds, British and Indian. Many British colonists discriminate against him, and he is held in some suspicion by Indian independence activists. During this time, violent anti-British demonstrations are taking place in the city. Hari becomes romantically involved with Daphne Manners, a young British woman who does not share her people's prejudices. One night, after Hari and Daphne make love in the public Bibighar Gardens, the couple are attacked by a group of unknown Indian men. Hari is beaten and Daphne is gang raped.\n\nRonald Merrick, a young lower-middle-class Englishman, is intelligent and hardworking. He is the local Indian Police superintendent. Merrick once professed to be romantically interested in Daphne, though she politely but firmly rebuffed him. He arrests Hari for her rape, holding him in the local jail. Hari is beaten and sexually humiliated. Merrick resents Hari's privileged education and disdains Daphne's preferring the young Indian to him. When Daphne refuses to cooperate with the investigation, the police do not prosecute Hari for rape. However, Merrick arrests Kumar and other young, educated Indians, jailing them without trial under the security regulations adopted to suppress the Indian independence movement. Word that Hari was tortured causes outrage in the Indian community. Merrick is transferred from Mayapore to a smaller and less important town in the province.\n\nDaphne learns she is pregnant. She chooses to believe Hari is the father, rather than one of the rapists. She dies in childbirth. The [[mixed-race]] daughter, Parvati, is taken in by Daphne's great-aunt, Lady Manners, widow of a former provincial governor. While Lady Manners takes the infant to the resort area of Srinagar, she meets Sarah Layton, a young British woman vacationing with her mother, Mildred, and sister, Susan. Sarah and Susan's father is the colonel of the Indian Army regiment in Pankot, a [[hill station]] near Mayapore. He is being held as a [[prisoner of war]] in Germany, after his unit was captured early in the war.  Susan and their mother prefer to stay away from Lady Manners due to the scandal of her great-niece's illegitimate birth, but Sarah pays a call on Lady Manners and the two women become friendly.\n\nSarah and her family soon encounter Merrick, who has left the police and procured a commission in the Indian Army. Teddie Bingham, an Indian Army officer and the fianc\u00e9 of Sarah's sister Susan, is stationed in the nearby princely state of Mirat; Merrick, also assigned there, happens to share quarters with him. Because the unit is soon to leave for the border with Burma, Teddie and Susan have to marry in Mirat.  When Teddie's best man for the ceremony becomes ill, he asks Merrick to step in. Merrick, seeing a relationship with the upper-class Teddie and the Laytons as a means to career advancement, is pleased to help.  While Merrick and Teddie are driving to the ceremony a stone is thrown at their car, slightly injuring Teddie.  Merrick understands that he was the target of the attack, as this is one of a series of incidents suggesting he is being harassed because of his treatment of Kumar and the other suspects in the Manners case in Mayapore.\n\nShortly after the wedding, Teddie and Merrick leave for the Burma front with their unit. Teddie is soon killed in an ambush by the Japanese-sponsored [[Indian National Army]] (INA). Merrick is badly wounded trying to get Teddie to safety and is evacuated to a Calcutta hospital. When Sarah visits him (at Susan's request), she learns that his arm will be amputated and that his burned face is permanently disfigured. Merrick says that Teddie was ambushed because of him. Teddie had left their unit to try to persuade two Indian soldiers of his regiment, who had been captured by the Japanese and joined the INA, to surrender and come in. Merrick believes Teddie wanted to prove to him that the Indian soldiers, even after becoming turncoats, would resume their loyalty to the British if given the chance. Merrick's disfigurement has increased hostility against Indians.\n\nLady Manners presses for a formal inquiry into Hari Kumar's arrest and detention. Nigel Rowan, an aide to the governor of the province conducts the interview with Hari, who learns during it that Daphne died.  After Rowan establishes that Merrick tortured Hari and there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, he arranges Hari's release. No action is taken against Merrick, however.\n\nAfter convalescing, Merrick is promoted and assigned to intelligence activities concerning the INA and Indian soldiers who collaborated with the enemy. He comes across the Laytons again in Bombay, where Sarah is reunited with her father, Colonel Layton, just released from a German POW camp.  Merrick is there to interrogate an Indian soldier who had served under Colonel Layton and assisted the Germans after Layton's unit was captured, and who has been deported to India. Merrick gains assistance from Sergeant Guy Perron, a young [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] graduate and Indian history scholar, who was serving with an [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] Field Security unit; he speaks fluent [[Urdu]] and is asked to observe the interrogation.  Merrick learns that Perron also attended Chillingborough and knew Hari Kumar.\n\nAfter the interrogation, Perron runs into Merrick and Sarah Layton at a party. He accompanies them to the apartment of Layton's aunt, where Sarah and her father are staying temporarily. Sarah and Perron are attracted to each other. Merrick decides to have Perron assigned to assist him in further investigations of Indian soldiers who became collaborators. Perron and Sarah both find Merrick distasteful, but Perron has no choice but to work with him.\n\nAfter her husband Teddie's death and a difficult birth of their son, Susan Layton Bingham suffers a mental breakdown. She is treated in a hospital in Pankot. When Merrick returns to the Pankot area for his work, he courts Susan and ultimately marries her. Perron later learns that Merrick illegally gained access to Susan's medical records, apparently to learn about her mental state in order to persuade her to marry him. Susan's sister, Sarah, opposes the marriage, but is unable to prevent it.\n\nWith the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the war in the East is ended, and the days of British rule in India are clearly numbered. Perron arranges a quick exit from the Army to return to Cambridge and his academic career. Due to his imminent departure, he and Sarah suspend their relationship. Sarah's parents also plan to return to England. Merrick intends to stay on, having been offered a contract by the government of Mirat to reorganize their police force.\n\nIn 1947, with the transition to Indian independence under way, Perron returns to India as an historical observer. The conflict between Hindus and Muslims related to independence is tense. While visiting Mirat at the invitation of its Chief Minister, Count Bronowsky, whom he previously met in Bombay, Perron learns that Merrick is dead, officially from a riding accident. Bronowsky tells Perron that Merrick actually died during a sexual rendezvous with a young Indian man who was probably working for independent activists. It is believed the man allowed an assassin access to Merrick. The authorities cover up the details of Merrick's death, fearing reprisals from Indians during the political uncertainty with the British departure. The two discuss their view that, in leaving India, the British are opening up \"[[Pandora's Box]],\" releasing the ancient competition for power between the Hindus and Muslims, who had earlier conquered and ruled the country. Some confrontations had been restrained by the power of the British as rulers.\n\nSarah, Susan, and their aunt attend Merrick's funeral in Mirat. Perron accompanies them, along with Merrick's ashes, on the train back to Pankot. Joining them is Ahmed Kasim, the educated son of a prominent Muslim politician who has been working for Bronowsky in Mirat for the past few years. En route to Pankot, the train is stopped by Hindus, who attack Muslim passengers in retaliation for recent attacks on Hindus in Mirat. The attackers demand that Kasim be turned over to them. Kasim voluntarily leaves the train car and surrenders himself to the attackers, who murder him. Perron, Sarah, and the other English passengers are unharmed, but are horrified by the slaughter of Kasim and other Muslim passengers.\n\nBefore leaving India again, Perron visits Hari Kumar, now living in a poor neighborhood and supporting himself by tutoring Indian students in English. He leaves his calling card, as Kumar is out. Perron reflects on how Kumar was caught in an impossible position, between England and India.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Peggy Ashcroft]] - Barbara Batchelor\n* [[Janet Henfrey]] - Edwina Crane\n* [[Derrick Branche]] - Ahmed Kasim\n* [[Charles Dance]] - Sgt Guy Perron\n* [[Geraldine James]] - Sarah Layton\n* [[Rachel Kempson]] - Lady Ethel Manners\n* [[Art Malik]] - Hari Kumar\n* [[Wendy Morgan (actress)|Wendy Morgan]] - Susan Layton\n* [[Judy Parfitt]] - Mildred Layton\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] - Supt./Capt/Maj/Lt Col Ronald Merrick\n* [[Eric Porter]] - Count Dmitri Bronowsky\n* [[Susan Wooldridge]] - Daphne Manners\n* [[Ralph Arliss]] - Capt.

The decision was made to attempt an adaptation of the quartet but to first test the company's ability to successfully complete a production in India by doing an adaptation of ''Staying On''. With the success of that television film, plans proceeded for the quartet.<ref name=\"Making\">{{cite book|title =The Making of the Jewel in the Crown| publisher=St. Martin's Press| year=1983|page=|isbn=0-312-50705-4}}</ref>\n\n===Adaptation===\nThe series is based on the ''Raj Quartet'' novels by Paul Scott:\n\n* ''[[The Jewel in the Crown (novel)|The Jewel in the Crown]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[The Day of the Scorpion]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[The Towers of Silence]]'' (1971)\n* ''[[A Division of the Spoils]]'' (1975)\n\nWhile the novels are written from different characters' viewpoints and move back and forth in time, the adaptation places events in roughly chronological order.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/16/arts/tv-view-jewel-in-the-crown-superb-drama.html |title=View: ''Jewel in the Crown'' is superb drama |first=John J. |last=O'Connor |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 16, 1984 |accessdate=February 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe series was shot on [[16mm film]], much of it on location in India. The scenes of the Nawab of Mirat's palace were filmed at [[Lake Palace]] in [[Udaipur]]. Besides all the Mirat scenes, Udaipur was also the location for Mayapore and some Pankot scenes. [[Shimla]] was the primary location for Pankot and many scenes were filmed in [[Mysore]] and [[Kashmir]].<ref name=\"Making\" />\n\nAll filming not from India was filmed at Manchester's Granada Studios. The programme was often screened from grainy prints, but was fully remastered for its 2005 [[DVD]] release and [[ITV3]] screening, resulting in much better picture quality.\n\n===Cast===\nThe series made stars of [[Art Malik]] and [[Charles Dance]]. Other leading actors included [[Peggy Ashcroft]] (who won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Best TV Actress award for her performance), [[Tim Pigott-Smith]], [[Geraldine James]], [[Judy Parfitt]], [[Rachel Kempson]], [[Eric Porter]], [[Susan Wooldridge]], [[Zohra Sehgal]], [[Saeed Jaffrey]], and [[Karan Kapoor]] (son of [[Shashi Kapoor]] and [[Jennifer Kendal]]). The complexities of the plot ensured that no one character was at the centre of the action throughout.  All four \"Best TV Actress\" nominations at that year's BAFTAs went to stars of the series, with Ashcroft winning over Wooldridge, James and Parfitt. Pigott-Smith won Best TV Actor.\n\nIn a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] compiled by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000 and voted by industry professionals, ''The Jewel in the Crown'' placed 22nd.\n\n==Broader context==\nAccording to the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] there was \"a cycle of film and television productions which emerged during the first half of the 1980s, which seemed to indicate Britain's growing preoccupation with India, Empire and a particular aspect of British cultural history\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/jewelinthe.htm|work=Museum of Broadcasting Communications|title=Jewel in the Crown|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref> In addition to ''The Jewel in the Crown'',  this cycle also included ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), ''[[Heat and Dust (film)|Heat and Dust]]'' (1983), ''[[The Far Pavilions]]'' (1984) and ''[[A Passage to India (film)|A Passage to India]]'' (1984).\n\nMini-series co-star Charles Dance has commented how it has a devout following to this day. \"I think that aired here in 1983, and there are people still to this day who assemble in each other\u2019s houses and have ''Jewel In The Crown'' weekends and watch all 14 hours, mostly in America,\" he told Attention Deficit Delirium. \"I have people stopping me in the street now saying that they watched ''Jewel In The Crown'' again a couple of months ago, and I think, 'Bloody hell, did you really?' So I\u2019m known to that generation for a completely different type of work. The current film and television viewing audience is much younger, and the kind of things that I\u2019m known for are these rather off-the-wall, slightly villainous characters in fantastical film and television things, but that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s better to be looked over than to be overlooked in my business.\"\n<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2011/12/04/charles-dance-talks-neverland-underworld-awakening-and-game-of-thrones/ | title=Charles Dance Talks \"Neverland,\" \"Underworld: Awakening\" and \"Game Of Thrones\" | first=Bryan | last=Reesman | date=4 December 2011 | website=Attention Deficit Delirium | accessdate=25 January 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124145109/http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2011/12/04/charles-dance-talks-neverland-underworld-awakening-and-game-of-thrones/ | archivedate=24 January 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn contemporary reviews, John J.

[[Granada Television]] produced the series for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network.\n\n==Plot==\nThe serial opens in the midst of [[World War II]] in the fictional Indian city of Mayapore, against the backdrop of the last years of the [[British Raj]] and the [[Indian independence movement]]. Hari Kumar is a young Indian man who was educated at Chillingborough, a [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|British public school]] (the British term for an elite [[private school]]); he identifies as [[English people|English]] rather than Indian. The bankruptcy of his father, a formerly successful businessman, forces him to return to India to live with his aunt.\n\nWorking as a journalist, Kumar now occupies a lower social status in India, and lives between two worlds, British and Indian. Many British colonists discriminate against him, and he is held in some suspicion by Indian independence activists. During this time, violent anti-British demonstrations are taking place in the city. Hari becomes romantically involved with Daphne Manners, a young British woman who does not share her people's prejudices. One night, after Hari and Daphne make love in the public Bibighar Gardens, the couple are attacked by a group of unknown Indian men. Hari is beaten and Daphne is gang raped.\n\nRonald Merrick, a young lower-class Englishman, is intelligent and hardworking. He is the local Indian Police superintendent. Merrick was once romantically interested in Daphne, though she politely but firmly rebuffed him. He arrests Hari for her rape, holding him in the local jail. Hari is beaten and sexually humiliated. Merrick resents Hari's privileged education and disdains Daphne's preferring the young Indian to him. When Daphne refuses to cooperate with the investigation, the police do not prosecute Hari for rape. However, Merrick arrests Kumar and other young, educated Indians, jailing them without trial under the security regulations adopted to suppress the Indian independence movement. Word that Hari was tortured causes outrage in the Indian community. Merrick is transferred from Mayapore to a smaller and less important town in the province.\n\nDaphne learns she is pregnant. She chooses to believe Hari is the father, rather than one of the rapists. She dies in childbirth. The [[mixed-race]] daughter, Parvati, is taken in by Daphne's great-aunt, Lady Manners, widow of a former provincial governor. While Lady Manners takes the infant to the resort area of Srinagar, she meets Sarah Layton, a young British woman vacationing with her mother, Mildred, and sister, Susan. Sarah and Susan's father is the colonel of the Indian Army regiment in Pankot, a [[hill station]] near Mayapore. He is being held as a [[prisoner of war]] in Germany, after his unit was captured early in the war.  Susan and their mother prefer to stay away from Lady Manners due to the scandal of her great-niece's illegitimate birth, but Sarah pays a call on Lady Manners and the two women become friendly.\n\nSarah and her family soon encounter Merrick, who has left the police and procured a commission in the Indian Army. Teddie Bingham, an Indian Army officer and the fianc\u00e9 of Sarah's sister Susan, is stationed in the nearby princely state of Mirat; Merrick, also assigned there, happens to share quarters with him. Because the unit is soon to leave for the border with Burma, Teddie and Susan have to marry in Mirat.  When Teddie's best man for the ceremony becomes ill, he asks Merrick to step in. Merrick, seeing a relationship with the upper-class Teddie and the Laytons as a means to career advancement, is pleased to help.  While Merrick and Teddie are driving to the ceremony a stone is thrown at their car, slightly injuring Teddie.  Merrick understands that he was the target of the attack, as this is one of a series of incidents suggesting he is being harassed because of his treatment of Kumar and the other suspects in the Manners case in Mayapore.\n\nShortly after the wedding, Teddie and Merrick leave for the Burma front with their unit. Teddie is soon killed in an ambush by the Japanese-sponsored [[Indian National Army]] (INA). Merrick is badly wounded trying to get Teddie to safety and is evacuated to a Calcutta hospital. When Sarah visits him (at Susan's request), she learns that his arm will be amputated and that his burned face is permanently disfigured. Merrick says that Teddie was ambushed because of him. Teddie had left their unit to try to persuade two Indian soldiers of his regiment, who had been captured by the Japanese and joined the INA, to surrender and come in. Merrick believes Teddie wanted to prove to him that the Indian soldiers, even after becoming turncoats, would resume their loyalty to the British if given the chance. Merrick's disfigurement has increased hostility against Indians.\n\nLady Manners presses for a formal inquiry into Hari Kumar's arrest and detention. Nigel Rowan, an aide to the governor of the province conducts the interview with Hari, who learns during it that Daphne died.  After Rowan establishes that Merrick tortured Hari and there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, he arranges Hari's release. No action is taken against Merrick, however.\n\nAfter convalescing, Merrick is promoted and assigned to intelligence activities concerning the INA and Indian soldiers who collaborated with the enemy. He comes across the Laytons again in Bombay, where Sarah is reunited with her father, Colonel Layton, just released from a German POW camp.  Merrick is there to interrogate an Indian soldier who had served under Colonel Layton and assisted the Germans after Layton's unit was captured, and who has been deported to India. Merrick gains assistance from Sergeant Guy Perron, a young [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] graduate and Indian history scholar, who was serving with an [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] Field Security unit; he speaks fluent [[Urdu]] and is asked to observe the interrogation.  Merrick learns that Perron also attended Chillingborough and knew Hari Kumar.\n\nAfter the interrogation, Perron runs into Merrick and Sarah Layton at a party. He accompanies them to the apartment of Layton's aunt, where Sarah and her father are staying temporarily. Sarah and Perron are attracted to each other. Merrick decides to have Perron assigned to assist him in further investigations of Indian soldiers who became collaborators. Perron and Sarah both find Merrick distasteful, but Perron has no choice but to work with him.\n\nAfter her husband Teddie's death and a difficult birth of their son, Susan Layton Bingham suffers a mental breakdown. She is treated in a hospital in Pankot. When Merrick returns to the Pankot area for his work, he courts Susan and ultimately marries her. Perron later learns that Merrick illegally gained access to Susan's medical records, apparently to learn about her mental state in order to persuade her to marry him. Susan's sister, Sarah, opposes the marriage, but is unable to prevent it.\n\nWith the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the war in the East is ended, and the days of British rule in India are clearly numbered. Perron arranges a quick exit from the Army to return to Cambridge and his academic career. Due to his imminent departure, he and Sarah suspend their relationship. Sarah's parents also plan to return to England. Merrick intends to stay on, having been offered a contract by the government of Mirat to reorganize their police force.\n\nIn 1947, with the transition to Indian independence under way, Perron returns to India as an historical observer. The conflict between Hindus and Muslims related to independence is tense. While visiting Mirat at the invitation of its Chief Minister, Count Bronowsky, whom he previously met in Bombay, Perron learns that Merrick is dead, officially from a riding accident. Bronowsky tells Perron that Merrick actually died during a sexual rendezvous with a young Indian man who was probably working for independent activists. It is believed the man allowed an assassin access to Merrick. The authorities cover up the details of Merrick's death, fearing reprisals from Indians during the political uncertainty with the British departure. The two discuss their view that, in leaving India, the British are opening up \"[[Pandora's Box]],\" releasing the ancient competition for power between the Hindus and Muslims, who had earlier conquered and ruled the country. Some confrontations had been restrained by the power of the British as rulers.\n\nSarah, Susan, and their aunt attend Merrick's funeral in Mirat. Perron accompanies them, along with Merrick's ashes, on the train back to Pankot. Joining them is Ahmed Kasim, the educated son of a prominent Muslim politician who has been working for Bronowsky in Mirat for the past few years. En route to Pankot, the train is stopped by Hindus, who attack Muslim passengers in retaliation for recent attacks on Hindus in Mirat. The attackers demand that Kasim be turned over to them. Kasim voluntarily leaves the train car and surrenders himself to the attackers, who murder him. Perron, Sarah, and the other English passengers are unharmed, but are horrified by the slaughter of Kasim and other Muslim passengers.\n\nBefore leaving India again, Perron visits Hari Kumar, now living in a poor neighborhood and supporting himself by tutoring Indian students in English. He leaves his calling card, as Kumar is out. Perron reflects on how Kumar was caught in an impossible position, between England and India.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Peggy Ashcroft]] - Barbara Batchelor\n* [[Janet Henfrey]] - Edwina Crane\n* [[Derrick Branche]] - Ahmed Kasim\n* [[Charles Dance]] - Sgt Guy Perron\n* [[Geraldine James]] - Sarah Layton\n* [[Rachel Kempson]] - Lady Ethel Manners\n* [[Art Malik]] - Hari Kumar\n* [[Wendy Morgan (actress)|Wendy Morgan]] - Susan Layton\n* [[Judy Parfitt]] - Mildred Layton\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] - Supt./Capt/Maj/Lt Col Ronald Merrick\n* [[Eric Porter]] - Count Dmitri Bronowsky\n* [[Susan Wooldridge]] - Daphne Manners\n* [[Ralph Arliss]] - Capt.

The scenes of the Nawab of Mirat's palace were filmed at [[Lake Palace]] in [[Udaipur]]. Besides all the Mirat scenes, Udaipur was also the location for Mayapore and some Pankot scenes. [[Shimla]] was the primary location for Pankot and many scenes were filmed in [[Mysore]] and [[Kashmir]].<ref name=\"Making\" />\n\nAll filming not from India was filmed at Manchester's Granada Studios. The programme was often screened from grainy prints, but was fully remastered for its 2005 [[DVD]] release and [[ITV3]] screening, resulting in much better picture quality.\n\n===Cast===\nThe series made stars of [[Art Malik]] and [[Charles Dance]]. Other leading actors included [[Peggy Ashcroft]] (who won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Best TV Actress award for her performance), [[Tim Pigott-Smith]], [[Geraldine James]], [[Judy Parfitt]], [[Rachel Kempson]], [[Eric Porter]], [[Susan Wooldridge]], [[Zohra Sehgal]], [[Saeed Jaffrey]], and [[Karan Kapoor]] (son of [[Shashi Kapoor]] and [[Jennifer Kendal]]). The complexities of the plot ensured that no one character was at the centre of the action throughout.  All four \"Best TV Actress\" nominations at that year's BAFTAs went to stars of the series, with Ashcroft winning over Wooldridge, James and Parfitt. Pigott-Smith won Best TV Actor.\n\nIn a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] compiled by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000 and voted by industry professionals, ''The Jewel in the Crown'' placed 22nd.\n\n==Broader context==\nAccording to the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] there was \"a cycle of film and television productions which emerged during the first half of the 1980s, which seemed to indicate Britain's growing preoccupation with India, Empire and a particular aspect of British cultural history\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/jewelinthe.htm|work=Museum of Broadcasting Communications|title=Jewel in the Crown|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref> In addition to ''The Jewel in the Crown'',  this cycle also included ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), ''[[Heat and Dust (film)|Heat and Dust]]'' (1983), ''[[The Far Pavilions]]'' (1984) and ''[[A Passage to India (film)|A Passage to India]]'' (1984).\n\nMini-series co-star Charles Dance has commented how it has a devout following to this day. \"I think that aired here in 1983, and there are people still to this day who assemble in each other\u2019s houses and have ''Jewel In The Crown'' weekends and watch all 14 hours, mostly in America,\" he told Attention Deficit Delirium. \"I have people stopping me in the street now saying that they watched ''Jewel In The Crown'' again a couple of months ago, and I think, 'Bloody hell, did you really?' So I\u2019m known to that generation for a completely different type of work. The current film and television viewing audience is much younger, and the kind of things that I\u2019m known for are these rather off-the-wall, slightly villainous characters in fantastical film and television things, but that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s better to be looked over than to be overlooked in my business.\"\n<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2011/12/04/charles-dance-talks-neverland-underworld-awakening-and-game-of-thrones/ | title=Charles Dance Talks \"Neverland,\" \"Underworld: Awakening\" and \"Game Of Thrones\" | first=Bryan | last=Reesman | date=4 December 2011 | website=Attention Deficit Delirium | accessdate=25 January 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124145109/http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2011/12/04/charles-dance-talks-neverland-underworld-awakening-and-game-of-thrones/ | archivedate=24 January 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn contemporary reviews, John J. O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"the careful accumulation of marvelous detail is never less than fascinating. And once again in a British production, the performances are rarely less than extraordinary... What emerges in the end is a comprehension of India far more convincing than the posturings of a [[Rudyard Kipling]] and far deeper than the tightly focused biography of a ''Gandhi.'' ''The Jewel in the Crown'' is not only engrossing television. It is important television, a model of what the medium can do.\"<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news | last = O'Connor | first = John J. |title = Jewel in the Crown: Superb Drama| newspaper = The New York Times |date = 16 December 1984| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/16/arts/tv-view-jewel-in-the-crown-superb-drama.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = November 21, 2016}}</ref> Jeff Jarvis of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine called it \"first-rate; the settings are stunning.
