Inbreeding also helps to ascertain the type of gene action affecting a trait. Inbreeding is also used to reveal deleterious recessive alleles, which can then be eliminated through [[assortative mating|assortative breeding]] or through culling. In [[plant breeding]], [[inbred line]]s are used as stocks for the creation of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] lines to make use of the effects of [[heterosis]].

The [[Coefficient of inbreeding|chances of such disorders]] are increased when the biological parents are more closely related.

For each homozygous recessive individual formed there is an equal chance of producing a homozygous dominant individual \u2014 one completely devoid of the harmful allele. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes; however, because the increased proportion of deleterious homozygotes exposes the allele to [[natural selection]], in the long run its frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred populations.  In the short term, incestuous reproduction is expected to increase the number of spontaneous abortions of zygotes, perinatal deaths, and postnatal offspring with birth defects.<ref>{{cite book | last = Thornhill | first = Nancy Wilmsen | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives |publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-79854-7 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ZFXYeHxwD10C&printsec=frontcover }}</ref> The advantages of inbreeding may be the result of a tendency to preserve the structures of alleles interacting at different loci that have been adapted together by a common selective history.<ref>Shields, W.

With persistent inbreeding, there is evidence that shows that inbreeding depression becomes less severe. This is associated with the unmasking and elimination of severely deleterious recessive alleles. However, inbreeding depression is not a temporary phenomenon because this elimination of deleterious recessive alleles will never be complete.  Eliminating slightly deleterious mutations through inbreeding under moderate selection is not as effective.

In outcrossing, unless there is verifiable genetic information, one may find that all individuals are distantly related to an ancient progenitor. If the trait carries throughout a population, all individuals can have this trait. This is called the [[founder effect]]. In the well established breeds, that are commonly bred, a large gene pool is present. For example, in 2004, over 18,000 Persian cats were registered.<ref>[http://www.petplace.com/cats/top-cat-breeds-for-2004/page1.aspx Top Cat Breeds for 2004]. Petplace.com. Retrieved on 2013-03-05.</ref> A possibility exists for a complete outcross, if no barriers exist between the individuals to breed. However, it is not always the case, and a form of distant linebreeding occurs. Again it is up to the assortative breeder to know what sort of traits, both positive and negative, exist within the diversity of one breeding. This diversity of genetic expression, within even close relatives, increases the variability and diversity of viable stock.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110616235259/http://www.bulldoginformation.com/breeding-quality.html Preserving Quality and Genetic Diversity in a Dog Breed]. bulldoginformation.com</ref>\n\n===Laboratory animals===\nSystematic inbreeding and maintenance of inbred strains of [[laboratory mice]] and rats is of great importance for biomedical research. The inbreeding guarantees a consistent and uniform [[animal model]] for experimental purposes and enables genetic studies in [[congenic]] and knock-out animals. In order to achieve a mouse strain that is considered inbred, a minimum of 20 sequential generations of sibling matings must occur. With each successive generation of breeding, homozygosity in the entire genome increases, eliminating heterozygous loci. With 20 generations of sibling matings, homozygosity is occurring at roughly 98.7% of all loci in the genome, allowing for these offspring to serve as animal models for genetic studies.<ref>Taft, Robert et al. \u201cKnow thy mouse.\u201d Science Direct.

Specifically, written documents such as the Bible illustrate that there have been laws and social customs that have called for the abstention from inbreeding.  Along with cultural taboos, parental education and awareness of inbreeding consequences have played large roles in minimizing inbreeding frequencies in areas like Europe.  That being so, there are less urbanized and less populated regions across the world that have shown continuity in the practice of inbreeding.\n\nThe continuity of inbreeding is often either by choice or unavoidably due to the limitations of the geographical area. When by choice, the rate of consanguinity is highly dependent on religion and culture.<ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" /> In the Western world some [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] groups are highly inbred because they originate from small founder populations and until{{Clarify|date=August 2019}} today{{When|date=August 2019}} marriage outside the groups is not allowed for members.{{cn|date=June 2019}}  Especially the [[Reidenbach Old Order Mennonites]]<ref>Karsten-Gerhard Albertsen: ''The History & Life of the Reidenbach Mennonites (Thirty Fivers)''.

The same is true for some [[Hasidic]] and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] groups.\n\nOf the practicing regions, Middle Eastern and northern Africa territories show the greatest frequencies of consanguinity. <ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" />  The link between the high frequency and the region is primarily due to the dominance of Islamic populations, who have historically engaged in familyline relations.<ref name=\"Bittles 2010\" />\n\nAmong these populations with high levels of inbreeding, researchers have found several disorders prevalent among inbred offspring.  In [[Lebanon]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Egypt]], and in [[Israel]], the offspring of consanguineous relationships have an increased risk of congenital malformations, congenital heart defects, congenital [[hydrocephalus]] and [[neural tube defect]]s.<ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" />  Furthermore, among inbred children in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and Lebanon, there is a positive association between consanguinity and reported [[Cleft palate|cleft lip/palate]] cases.<ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" />  Historically, populations of [[Qatar]] have engaged in consanguineous relationships of all kinds, leading to high risk of inheriting genetic diseases.

For example, in [[livestock breeding]], breeders may use inbreeding when trying to establish a new and desirable [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] in the stock and for producing distinct families within a breed, but will need to watch for undesirable characteristics in offspring, which can then be eliminated through further selective breeding or [[culling]]. Inbreeding also helps to ascertain the type of gene action affecting a trait. Inbreeding is also used to reveal deleterious recessive alleles, which can then be eliminated through [[assortative mating|assortative breeding]] or through culling. In [[plant breeding]], [[inbred line]]s are used as stocks for the creation of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] lines to make use of the effects of [[heterosis]].

For each homozygous recessive individual formed there is an equal chance of producing a homozygous dominant individual \u2014 one completely devoid of the harmful allele. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes; however, because the increased proportion of deleterious homozygotes exposes the allele to [[natural selection]], in the long run its frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred populations.

With persistent inbreeding, there is evidence that shows that inbreeding depression becomes less severe. This is associated with the unmasking and elimination of severely deleterious recessive alleles. However, inbreeding depression is not a temporary phenomenon because this elimination of deleterious recessive alleles will never be complete.

In outcrossing, unless there is verifiable genetic information, one may find that all individuals are distantly related to an ancient progenitor. If the trait carries throughout a population, all individuals can have this trait. This is called the [[founder effect]]. In the well established breeds, that are commonly bred, a large gene pool is present.

However, it is not always the case, and a form of distant linebreeding occurs. Again it is up to the assortative breeder to know what sort of traits, both positive and negative, exist within the diversity of one breeding. This diversity of genetic expression, within even close relatives, increases the variability and diversity of viable stock.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110616235259/http://www.bulldoginformation.com/breeding-quality.html Preserving Quality and Genetic Diversity in a Dog Breed]. bulldoginformation.com</ref>\n\n===Laboratory animals===\nSystematic inbreeding and maintenance of inbred strains of [[laboratory mice]] and rats is of great importance for biomedical research. The inbreeding guarantees a consistent and uniform [[animal model]] for experimental purposes and enables genetic studies in [[congenic]] and knock-out animals. In order to achieve a mouse strain that is considered inbred, a minimum of 20 sequential generations of sibling matings must occur. With each successive generation of breeding, homozygosity in the entire genome increases, eliminating heterozygous loci. With 20 generations of sibling matings, homozygosity is occurring at roughly 98.7% of all loci in the genome, allowing for these offspring to serve as animal models for genetic studies.<ref>Taft, Robert et al. \u201cKnow thy mouse.\u201d Science Direct.

Specifically, written documents such as the Bible illustrate that there have been laws and social customs that have called for the abstention from inbreeding.  Along with cultural taboos, parental education and awareness of inbreeding consequences have played large roles in minimizing inbreeding frequencies in areas like Europe.  That being so, there are less urbanized and less populated regions across the world that have shown continuity in the practice of inbreeding.\n\nThe continuity of inbreeding is often either by choice or unavoidably due to the limitations of the geographical area. When by choice, the rate of consanguinity is highly dependent on religion and culture.<ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" /> In the Western world some [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] groups are highly inbred because they originate from small founder populations and until{{Clarify|date=August 2019}} today{{When|date=August 2019}} marriage outside the groups is not allowed for members.{{cn|date=June 2019}}  Especially the [[Reidenbach Old Order Mennonites]]<ref>Karsten-Gerhard Albertsen: ''The History & Life of the Reidenbach Mennonites (Thirty Fivers)''.  Morgantown, Pennsylvania 1996, page 443.</ref> and the [[Hutterites]] stem from very small founder populations. The same is true for some [[Hasidic]] and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] groups.\n\nOf the practicing regions, Middle Eastern and northern Africa territories show the greatest frequencies of consanguinity. <ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" />  The link between the high frequency and the region is primarily due to the dominance of Islamic populations, who have historically engaged in familyline relations.<ref name=\"Bittles 2010\" />\n\nAmong these populations with high levels of inbreeding, researchers have found several disorders prevalent among inbred offspring.  In [[Lebanon]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Egypt]], and in [[Israel]], the offspring of consanguineous relationships have an increased risk of congenital malformations, congenital heart defects, congenital [[hydrocephalus]] and [[neural tube defect]]s.<ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" />  Furthermore, among inbred children in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and Lebanon, there is a positive association between consanguinity and reported [[Cleft palate|cleft lip/palate]] cases.<ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" />  Historically, populations of [[Qatar]] have engaged in consanguineous relationships of all kinds, leading to high risk of inheriting genetic diseases.  As of 2014, around 5% of the Qatari population suffered from hereditary hearing loss; most were descendants of a consanguineous relationship.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Girotto G, Mezzavilla M, Abdulhadi K, Vuckovic D, Vozzi D, Khalifa Alkowari M, Gasparini P, Badii R | title = Consanguinity and hereditary hearing loss in Qatar | journal = Human Heredity | volume = 77 | issue = 1\u20134 | pages = 175\u201382 | date = 2014-01-01 | pmid = 25060281 | doi = 10.1159/000360475 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Royalty and nobility===\n[[File:Anuk.PNG|thumb|[[Tutankhamun]] ({{c.}} 1341\u20131323 BC) (receiving flowers from [[Ankhesenamun]]).

These ties were often sealed only upon the birth of progeny within the [[arranged marriage]]. Thus marriage was seen as a union of lines of nobility, not as a contract between individuals as it is seen today.\n\n[[Royal intermarriage]] was often practiced among European royal families, usually for interests of state. Over time, due to the relatively limited number of potential consorts, the [[gene pool]] of many ruling families grew progressively smaller, until all European royalty was related. This also resulted in many being descended from a certain person through many lines of descent, such as the numerous European royalty and nobility descended from the British [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] or [[King Christian IX of Denmark]].<ref name=\"beechegotha1\">{{cite book | title=The Gotha: Still a Continental Royal Family, Vol. 1 | publisher=Kensington House Books | last = Beeche | first = Arturo | name-list-format = vanc | year=2009 | location=Richmond, US | pages=1\u201313 | isbn=978-0-9771961-7-3}}</ref> The House of [[Habsburg]] was infamous for its inbreeding, with the [[Prognathism|Habsburg lip]] cited as an ill-effect, although no genetic evidence has proved the claim.
