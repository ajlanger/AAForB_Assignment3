Israel ratified the UN Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees in 1951, which theoretically gives protection or asylum to anyone with a \"well-founded fear of being persecuted\" and forbids the deportation of refugees to the country where their lives were initially threatened. This policy has not been explicitly followed by Israel, but Palestinian LGBT immigrants have been accepted into Israeli LGBT communities, where previous legal LGBT marriages are officially recognized, though gay marriage is not legal in Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtonnote.com/israels_treatme/|title=Israel's Treatment of Gay Palestinian Asylum Seekers The Washington Note by Steve Clemons|date=6 June 2011|publisher=}}</ref> As a result, Middle Eastern migration of LGBT people to Israel has been seen.\n\nTel Aviv was dubbed the \u201cgay capital of the Middle East\u201d by Out Magazine in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-the-white-city-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow-1.5235384|title=The White City at the End of the Rainbow|first=Brian|last=Schaefer|date=23 March 2013|publisher=|newspaper=Haaretz}}</ref>\n\n===Nepal and the Philippines===\n\nMost families of  LGBTQ+ emigrants from Nepal and the Philippines indicate that,  although most emigrants' families do not approve of their lifestyles, remittance payments (i.e. when the person who left the country sends money back to their family) are a proven aid to breaking down the controversies surrounding their gender and/or sexual nonconformity.<ref name=\"HIIII\" />\n\n===Irish LGBTQ migration to London===\nAs of 2009,{{needs update|date=November 2017}} Irish people have been known to migrate to Britain and especially to London where they typically try to find employment. More recently, London has seen an immigration of Irish LGBT people who are hoping to find a more accepting social environment. Urban areas and large international cities are often seen as tolerant and sexually diverse, and many already contain established queer communities.<ref name=flood>Ryan-Flood, Roisin (2009).

Swindon: ESRC</ref>\n\nIrish LGBT immigrants often experience vulnerability in the absence of family networks, which is exacerbated in the context of homophobia and sexual discrimination. Legal protection against sexual discrimination in employment was only introduced in the UK in 2003. Even when legislative provisions and support are in place, homophobia continues to make life and the process of migration difficult for queer migrants.<ref name=flood/>\n\n===Obstacles to queer asylum seekers and immigrants===\nRefugees, defined by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), are displaced persons who \u201cowing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Real queer? : sexual orientation and gender identity refugees in the Canadian refugee apparatus|last=1962-|first=Murray, David A.

Individuals can seek refugee status or asylum in several different ways: they can register at an U.N. outpost, visit their intended country and a visa and apply once they are in the country, or they can make a report at their official government representation headquarters.<ref name=\":0\" /> Once a claim is filed, the intended country for reallocation evaluates eligibility of asylum requirements.[UNHCR] During meetings to determine eligibility and suitability, applicants face obstacles that can prevent them from making a successful claim.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Rejecting refugees : political asylum in the 21st century|last=Carol.|first=Bohmer|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|others=Shuman, Amy, 1951-|isbn=978-0415773768|location=London|oclc=123912524}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Shuman|first=Amy|last2=Bohmer|first2=Carol|date=2014-10-31|title=Gender and cultural silences in the political asylum process|journal=Sexualities|language=en|volume=17|issue=8|pages=939\u2013957|doi=10.1177/1363460714552262}}</ref>\n\n==== Navigating the system ====\nThe first obstacle asylum seekers face is navigating the process in applying for refugee status or asylum. Countries like the United States, do not offer any legal assistance in making the asylum claim, requiring the applicant to find and fund their own legal representation.<ref name=\":1\" /> Many applicants inside the United States do not get a lawyer during this process and represent themselves. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom offer legal aid, increasing the number of applicants who have access to legal advice and representation in applying for refugee status or asylum.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile many refugees share the same difficulties navigating the system, LGBTQ refugees face additional challenges due to the nature of their claim. Communities are built among LGBTQ refugees and asylum-seekers, leading to a network of advice about how to navigate the system.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> These networks help share success stories in navigating the system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Agencies funded by the government to resettle and assist refugees and asylum-seekers can offer further, more general assistance. According to Carol Bohmer and Amy Shuman, statistics make it clear that chances of a successful asylum or refugee claim are greatly improved with legal assistance in the United States.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=SCHOENHOLTZ|first=ANDREW|last2=JACOBS|first2=JONATHON|date=|title=The State of Asylum Representation: Ideas for Change|url=|journal=Georgetown Immigration Law Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, the percentage of refugee claims admitted for LGBTQ claims tend to be lower compared to its heterosexual counterparts.\n\nRefugees also face difficulty in securing housing once their application process is approved. In the United Kingdom, for instance, refugees can face difficulties integrating into neighborhoods, and are faced with gaps in provision, choices of housing options, and on-going support.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Deborah|date=2006-07-01|title=Moving Towards Integration: The Housing of Asylum Seekers and Refugees in Britain|journal=Housing Studies|volume=21|issue=4|pages=539\u2013553|doi=10.1080/02673030600709074|issn=0267-3037}}</ref>\n\n==== Credibility ====\nDue to the nature of sexuality and gender claims, applicants often encounter issues with the credibility of their stories.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Sexuality and gender identification is a private expression that cannot be determined by appearance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vogler|first=Stefan|date=2016|title=Legally Queer: The Construction of Sexuality in LGBQ Asylum Claims|url=|journal=Law & Society Review|volume=50|pages=|via=}}</ref> In seeking asylum, applicants are expected to prove their sexual or gender orientation as a proof of being a part of a particular social membership. They are also expected to prove that they are in fear of their life.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Forbear|first=Katherine|date=2015|title=\"I Thought We Had No Rights\" - Challenges in Listening, Storytelling, and Representation of LGBT Refugees|url=|journal=Studies in Social Justice|volume=9|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Applicants applying for asylum due to sexual orientation are asked to present an \u201cidentity narrative.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Neva|date=Winter 2016|title=B is for Bisexual: The Forgotten Letter in U.K. Sexual Orientation Asylum Reform|url=|journal=Transnational Law & Contemporary Problems|volume=26|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> There are several different credibility obstacles that applicants face during the application process.\n\nAccording to Neva Wagner, asylum claims in the United Kingdom face a \u201cnotorious challenge.\u201d Over 98% of sexual orientation claims were denied in the United Kingdom between 2005 and 2009, compared to the 76.5% refusal rating for all asylum applicants. Bisexual claimants face an even greater challenge due to their dual sexuality. In bisexuality claims, claimants must demonstrate that they are at risk for persecution, even if their sexuality allows them to act in a heterosexual manner.\n\nLawyer S Chelvan reported to the Huffington post reported that the use of pornographic evidence\u2014individuals taping themselves having sex with same sex partners\u2014has risen due to challenges to credibility of queer claims. Furthermore, immigration officials have refused witnesses for the credibility of queer asylum claims if the witness did not have sex with applicant. Credibility becomes an issue, as many refugees keep their identity as being queer a secret from their own family and friends in order to avoid persecution.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Shuman|first=Amy|last2=Hesford|first2=Wendy S|date=2014-10-31|title=Getting Out: Political asylum, sexual minorities, and privileged visibility|journal=Sexualities|language=en|volume=17|issue=8|pages=1016\u20131034|doi=10.1177/1363460714557600|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a637e25505a177bb9a189bdabe1f552a70bb523d}}</ref>\n\n===== Cultural differences in gender and narratives =====\nThe first step in verifying eligibility for asylum-seekers and refugee applicants is the initial investigation into why asylum is being sought. This is often done through applicant narratives, where the applicant is asked questions about their experiences and are evaluated in how their stories match the eligibility requirements.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> In the U.K., initial credibility determinations are given great significance. Initial determinations are not reviewable by appeal, and if credibility is examined, initial determinations are given precedence.<ref name=\":3\" /> Retelling their experiences can be traumatic and unaligned with a chronological telling that is expected in Westernized narratives.<ref name=\":2\" /> There is also an inherent gendered expectation in narratives. Rachel Lewis writes that \u201cThe racialized, classed, and gendered stereotypes of male homosexual identity typically invoked by asylum adjudicators pose particular challenges to lesbian asylum applicants.\u201d<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Rachel A|date=2014-10-31|title=\"Gay?

Women's narratives of persecution often take place in the home, so the violence experienced by females is often taken less seriously than males.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Susan A.|date=2009-03-01|title=Production and Reproduction of Gender and Sexuality in Legal Discourses of Asylum in the United States|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=34|issue=3|pages=659\u2013685|doi=10.1086/593380|issn=0097-9740}}</ref> Rachel Lewis argues that same-sex female desires and attraction are often overlooked in the U.K. cases, and applicants face a \"lack of representational space within heteronormative asylum narratives for the articulation of same-sex desire.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> Simply put, lesbian narratives don't fit into the expected picture of an LGBTQ applicant. Instead, the expectations is for women to be discreet in their affairs to avoid persecution.<ref name=\":6\" />  Persecution of lesbians can be seen as routine in countries where it is common for women to be raped\u2014every women then, is at risk of being attacked, and their lesbian identity would not constitute being persecuted for being a part of a social grouping.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Rachel|date=2013-09-05|title=Deportable Subjects: Lesbians and Political Asylum|journal=Feminist Formations|volume=25|issue=2|pages=174\u2013194|doi=10.1353/ff.2013.0027|issn=2151-7371}}</ref> Women who appear vulnerable because they are openly lesbian or foreign women \"in need of rescue from oppressive patriarchal--read ''third world''--cultures\" are more likely to be granted political asylum due to sexuality than women who identify as lesbian privately.\n\n===Legalization of LGBTQ marriage=== \n[[File:Same-sex-marriage-taiwan.jpg|thumb|Legally unrecognized lesbian marriage in Taiwan]]\n{{further|same-sex marriage}}\n\nIn the United States, only heterosexual bi-national couples were provided sponsorship benefits when they marry.
