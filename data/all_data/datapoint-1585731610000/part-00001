She remarked that Collette's acting method references the components of [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski\u2019s System of Acting]]. In studying Collette's typecasting as mothers, Kingston wrote, \"[Collette] selectively chooses roles of women and mothers which she can portray in ways that are multidimensional and different from another.\" She also wrote that Collette makes conscious efforts to break from the typecasting, with leading roles in films like ''Miss You Already'' and ''Lucky Them''. At the end of her analysis, Kingston concluded, \"Collette truly is a chameleon in both the versatility of her acting style and in the kind of roles she is willing to approach with a physicality-based method.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mcgillchannelundergraduatereview.com/2018/04/toni-collette-character-as-craft/|title=Toni Collette: Character as Craft \u2013 The Channel|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Toni Collette by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|236x236px|Collette at the 2015 [[San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic Con]] promoting [[Krampus (film)|''Krampus'']] (2015)|alt=]]\nIn 1998, she stayed in a flat in [[Brixton]] for a few months before leaving after she saw a man \"getting his head bashed in with a pole 30 metres away\".<ref name=\":11\" /> She briefly lived in [[Sydney]] in the 2000s before she moved to [[Los Angeles]], where she currently resides with her family.<ref name=\":11\" /> However, she has said that she and her husband plan to return to Sydney some day.<ref name=\":11\" /> Collette had dated ''Velvet Goldmine'' co-star [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers|Jonathan Rhys-Meyers]] for a year before ending their relationship.
