At the age of four, she moved to [[Tokyo]] with her family. She sang in public for the first time at a Tokyo [[karaoke]] bar, and realised she wanted to be a performer. Growing up with the city's karaoke bar traditions and hearing music ranging from [[Motown]] musicians to [[The Beatles]] at home also inspired her to pursue music. She started writing her own songs at the age of seven, and would perform them for her family. She moved to [[Hong Kong]] at the age of 10, where she lived until she was 18. She continued to pursue music throughout her youth, participating in a number of school talent shows and performances.
