The station originally broadcast on UHF channel 52 under its original callsign '''W52AI'''. It became '''W53AZ''' in 1990 after moving the signal to UHF channel 53. Two years later, the station moved its signal again to channel 51 and changing the call letters to '''W51BY'''.<ref name=rabbitears/> It remained a TBN translator until 2003. In 2003, the station moved its signal to UHF channel 46, and changed the callsign again, this time to '''W46DK'''.

The station\u2019s callsign was changed to the original '''WUOA-LD'''. In Summer 2016, DTV America Corporation purchased the station and converted it into an affiliate of [[Katz Broadcasting]]-operated Laff network. This was the second DTV America-owned station to sign on in the state of Alabama (the first was [[MyNetworkTV]]/[[Doctor Television Channel|Doctor TV]] affiliate [[WDSF-LD]] which signed on in 2014). \nThe station also launched second and third subchannels to run [[FremantleMedia]]\u2019s [[Buzzr]] network, and Laff\u2019s sister network [[Escape (TV network)|Escape]], respectively.\n\n==Digital channels== \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
