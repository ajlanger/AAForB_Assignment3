Starting his career at the now-defunct game company [[Cavia (company)|Cavia]], he became known for his work on the [[action role-playing video game]] series ''[[Drakengard]]'' and its two spin-offs: ''[[Nier (video game)|Nier]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Nier: Automata]]''. Yoko was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], and studied at the [[Kobe Design University]] in the 1990s. While initially not intending to pursue a career in video games, after working at Namco and Sony, he joined Cavia and became the director and scenario writer for the first ''Drakengard'' game. He has since worked extensively on every game in the series (except ''Drakengard 2''), as well as on mobile titles after becoming a freelancer after Cavia's absorption into [[AQ Interactive]].\n\nYoko has become known for his style of game design, incorporating unconventional design choices and stories. One of the main aspects of his work is exploring the darker aspects of people, such as why they are driven to kill each other, although he typically does not share a common opinion on his story's dark natures. His writing technique, described as \"backwards scriptwriting,\" involves outlining the ending of the story first and building the narrative backward from that point. Due to his disdain from being photographed, he generally wears a mask when giving interviews or presenting games.\n\n==Biography==\nYoko Taro was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], on June 6, 1970.<ref name=\"BukkoroYoko\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bukkoro.com/about_member.html|title=BUKKORO / ABOUT|publisher=Bukkoro.com|accessdate=2014-07-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726100840/http://www.bukkoro.com/_about/index.html|archivedate=2014-07-26|url-status=live}}</ref> Yoko's parents were often absent at their jobs, so he was mostly raised by his grandmother, who left a strong impression on him.<ref name=\"YokoFamily\">{{cite web|url=http://ameblo.jp/yokota6/entry-11503448652.html|title=\u3010\u65e5\u8a18\u3011\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3061\u3083\u3093\u304c\u6b7b\u3093\u3060\u3002|publisher=Diary of Taro Yoko (blog)|last=Yoko|first=Taro|date=2013-04-02|accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref> During his youth, he heard about an incident that would influence his later work as a scenario writer: while an acquaintance was in a shopping street with a group of friends, one of them who was walking along a high building roof slipped and died from the fall.

Starting his career at the now-defunct game company [[Cavia (company)|Cavia]], he became known for his work on the [[action role-playing video game]] series ''[[Drakengard]]'' and its two spin-offs: ''[[Nier (video game)|Nier]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Nier: Automata]]''. Yoko was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], and studied at the [[Kobe Design University]] in the 1990s. While initially not intending to pursue a career in video games, after working at Namco and Sony, he joined Cavia and became the director and scenario writer for the first ''Drakengard'' game. He has since worked extensively on every game in the series (except ''Drakengard 2''), as well as on mobile titles after becoming a freelancer after Cavia's absorption into [[AQ Interactive]].\n\nYoko has become known for his style of game design, incorporating unconventional design choices and stories. One of the main aspects of his work is exploring the darker aspects of people, such as why they are driven to kill each other, although he typically does not share a common opinion on his story's dark natures. His writing technique, described as \"backwards scriptwriting,\" involves outlining the ending of the story first and building the narrative backward from that point. Due to his disdain from being photographed, he generally wears a mask when giving interviews or presenting games.\n\n==Biography==\nYoko Taro was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], on June 6, 1970.<ref name=\"BukkoroYoko\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bukkoro.com/about_member.html|title=BUKKORO / ABOUT|publisher=Bukkoro.com|accessdate=2014-07-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726100840/http://www.bukkoro.com/_about/index.html|archivedate=2014-07-26|url-status=live}}</ref> Yoko's parents were often absent at their jobs, so he was mostly raised by his grandmother, who left a strong impression on him.<ref name=\"YokoFamily\">{{cite web|url=http://ameblo.jp/yokota6/entry-11503448652.html|title=\u3010\u65e5\u8a18\u3011\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3061\u3083\u3093\u304c\u6b7b\u3093\u3060\u3002|publisher=Diary of Taro Yoko (blog)|last=Yoko|first=Taro|date=2013-04-02|accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref> During his youth, he heard about an incident that would influence his later work as a scenario writer: while an acquaintance was in a shopping street with a group of friends, one of them who was walking along a high building roof slipped and died from the fall.
