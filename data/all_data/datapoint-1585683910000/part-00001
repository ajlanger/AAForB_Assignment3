The NES restarted the [[video game industry]] after the [[video game crash of 1983]], and was an international success. In 1989, Nintendo released the [[Game Boy]], which became the first handheld console to sell in large numbers. In the early 1990s, Nintendo's market lead began to decrease; although the 1990 [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) was a strong seller, the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] was a very strong contender. Nintendo and [[Sega]] would both lose a significant portion of the console market towards the end of the 1990s, as [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]'s [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] became the most popular console, beating the [[Nintendo 64]], though Nintendo managed to sell more than [[Sega Saturn]].\n\nThe [[Dreamcast]], released in 1999, [[PlayStation 2]], released in 2000, and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], released in 2001, would eventually relegate Nintendo to third place in the international market, despite the release of the [[GameCube]]. However, they retained their lead in the handheld console market, with the [[Game Boy Color]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] models. Towards the middle of the 2000s, Nintendo introduced the first successful handheld device with a touch screen ([[Nintendo DS|DS]]) and the first successful console designed for motion controlled inputs (the [[Wii]]); they became some of the [[List of million-selling game consoles|best-selling consoles]] of all time. In 2010, Nintendo became the first major company to release a handheld game console with [[stereoscopic 3D]] capabilities, with the [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]], which had very strong sales from the beginning. The [[Wii U]], released in 2012, was much less successful, and sales were significantly lower than predicted. The company's most recent console, [[Nintendo Switch]], was released in March 2017 and has now surpassed the entire lifetime sales of the Wii U.\n== Home consoles ==\n\n=== Color TV-Game ===\n{{Main|Color TV-Game}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Color-TV-Game-Blockbreaker-FL.jpg|thumb|One of five [[Color TV-Game]] consoles|215px]]The [[Color TV-Game]] is a series of five dedicated home consoles released only in Japan.

In Japan, it is known as the \"Family Computer\" (or \"Famicom\", as it is commonly abbreviated). Selling 61.91 million units worldwide, the NES helped revitalize the video game industry following the [[video game crash of 1983]] and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from [[game design]] to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted [[third-party developer]]s. Many of Nintendo's most iconic franchises, such as ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' and ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]''<!-- NOT the Mario series, which was started in arcades in Donkey Kong, and not Kirby, which was started on the GameBoy --> were started on the NES. Nintendo continued to repair Famicom consoles in Japan until October 31, 2007, attributing the decision to discontinue support to an increasing shortage of the necessary parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/0710/16/news102.html|script-title=ja:\u521d\u4ee3\u300c\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u300d\u306a\u3069\u516c\u5f0f\u4fee\u7406\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u7d42\u4e86|accessdate=January 20, 2008|author=|date=October 16, 2007|work=ITmedia News|publisher=ITmedia|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-renaissance.com/2007/10/nintendo-of-japan-dropping-hardware.html |title=Nintendo of Japan dropping Hardware support for the Famicom |accessdate=January 20, 2008 |author=RyanDG |date=October 16, 2007 |publisher=Arcade Renaissance |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317164110/http://www.arcade-renaissance.com/2007/10/nintendo-of-japan-dropping-hardware.html |archivedate=March 17, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nintendo's classic Famicom faces end of road |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAJfrC1k8lDKLOCGJu4VonjOYxBg |format=Reprint |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=October 31, 2007 |accessdate=November 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105193128/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAJfrC1k8lDKLOCGJu4VonjOYxBg |archivedate=November 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nNintendo released a software-emulation-based version of the Nintendo Entertainment System on November 10, 2016.

In [[Japan]] it is known as the '''Super Famicom'''. In [[South Korea]], it is known as the '''Super Comboy''' and was distributed by [[Hyundai Electronics]].\n\nThe Super NES was Nintendo's second home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Whereas the earlier console had struggled in the PAL region and large parts of [[Asia]], the Super NES was a global success, albeit one that could not match its predecessor's popularity in Northeast Asia and [[North America]]\u2014due in part to increased competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console (released in Europe and Asia but Korea as the Mega Drive). Despite its relatively late start, the Super NES became the best selling console of the [[16-bit era]], selling 49.10 million systems worldwide.<ref name=\"nintendosales\"/> The Super NES library is known for upgrading some of Nintendo's most famous franchises, and making the games even more critically acclaimed, such as ''[[Super Metroid]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VI|VI]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]'', as well starting some popular franchises such as ''[[Star Fox (series)|Star Fox]]'' and ''[[Mega Man X]]''.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Nintendo 64 ===\n{{Main|Nintendo 64}}\n[[File:N64-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|A [[Nintendo 64]]|215px]]\nReleased June 23, 1996, The '''Nintendo 64''', commonly called the '''N64''', and codenamed Ultra 64, was Nintendo's third home [[video game console]] for the international market.

Until the console's unveiling at [[SpaceWorld]] 2000, the design project was known as ''Dolphin''\u2014this can still be seen in the console and its accessories' model numbers. The GameCube is the most compact sixth generation console. The GameCube is Nintendo's first game console to use [[optical disc]]s rather than [[game cartridge]]s. An agreement with the optical drive manufacturer [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] led to a DVD-playing GameCube system named the [[Panasonic Q]], which was only released in Japan. Much of Nintendo's core line-up centered on sequels to their established hit franchises such as ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker]]'', ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Star Fox Adventures]]'', while new franchises like ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' and ''[[Pikmin]]'' were born, although the former franchise had seen a Japan-exclusive release on the N64.

Most featured a single game that could be played on an LCD screen, in addition to a clock and an alarm. Most titles had a \"GAME A\" and a \"GAME B\" button. Game B is usually a faster, more difficult version of Game A. Different models were manufactured, with some consoles having two screens (the Multiscreen Series) and a clam-shell design. The Nintendo DS later reused this design. The Game & Watch made handhelds vastly popular. Many toy companies followed in the footsteps of Game & Watch, such as Tiger Electronics and their Star Wars themed games. Nintendo's Game & Watch units were eventually superseded by the original Game Boy. Each Game & Watch was only able to play one game, due to the use of a segmented LCD display being pre-printed with an overlay. The speed and responsiveness of the games was also limited by the time it took the LCD to change state. The Game & Watch sold over 80 million units worldwide.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Game Boy ===\n{{Main|Game Boy}}\n[[File:Game-Boy-Original.png|thumb|An original [[Game Boy]]|115px]]\nThe '''Game Boy''' was the first [[handheld game console]] sold by Nintendo that featured interchangeable cartridges for each game, unlike the [[Game & Watch]] that had a different system for each game.

Most video games are forced to use [[Depth perception|monocular cues]] to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, but the Virtual Boy was able to create a more accurate illusion of depth through an effect known as parallax. The Nintendo 3DS also uses this technology. In a manner similar to using a [[head-mounted display]], the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image. It was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and August 14, 1995 in North America and at a price of around US$180. It met with a lukewarm reception that was unaffected by continued price drops. Exactly 14 titles were released for ''Virtual Boy'' in North America, but only a few were met with positive reception. The system is rarely mentioned by [[Nintendo]], however it is seen through microgames in ''[[Wario (series)#WarioWare|WarioWare]]'' games.

Until the console's unveiling at [[SpaceWorld]] 2000, the design project was known as ''Dolphin''\u2014this can still be seen in the console and its accessories' model numbers. The GameCube is the most compact sixth generation console. The GameCube is Nintendo's first game console to use [[optical disc]]s rather than [[game cartridge]]s. An agreement with the optical drive manufacturer [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] led to a DVD-playing GameCube system named the [[Panasonic Q]], which was only released in Japan. Much of Nintendo's core line-up centered on sequels to their established hit franchises such as ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker]]'', ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Star Fox Adventures]]'', while new franchises like ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' and ''[[Pikmin]]'' were born, although the former franchise had seen a Japan-exclusive release on the N64.

Most featured a single game that could be played on an LCD screen, in addition to a clock and an alarm. Most titles had a \"GAME A\" and a \"GAME B\" button. Game B is usually a faster, more difficult version of Game A. Different models were manufactured, with some consoles having two screens (the Multiscreen Series) and a clam-shell design. The Nintendo DS later reused this design. The Game & Watch made handhelds vastly popular. Many toy companies followed in the footsteps of Game & Watch, such as Tiger Electronics and their Star Wars themed games. Nintendo's Game & Watch units were eventually superseded by the original Game Boy. Each Game & Watch was only able to play one game, due to the use of a segmented LCD display being pre-printed with an overlay. The speed and responsiveness of the games was also limited by the time it took the LCD to change state. The Game & Watch sold over 80 million units worldwide.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Game Boy ===\n{{Main|Game Boy}}\n[[File:Game-Boy-Original.png|thumb|An original [[Game Boy]]|115px]]\nThe '''Game Boy''' was the first [[handheld game console]] sold by Nintendo that featured interchangeable cartridges for each game, unlike the [[Game & Watch]] that had a different system for each game.

Most video games are forced to use [[Depth perception|monocular cues]] to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, but the Virtual Boy was able to create a more accurate illusion of depth through an effect known as parallax. The Nintendo 3DS also uses this technology. In a manner similar to using a [[head-mounted display]], the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image. It was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and August 14, 1995 in North America and at a price of around US$180. It met with a lukewarm reception that was unaffected by continued price drops. Exactly 14 titles were released for ''Virtual Boy'' in North America, but only a few were met with positive reception. The system is rarely mentioned by [[Nintendo]], however it is seen through microgames in ''[[Wario (series)#WarioWare|WarioWare]]'' games.
