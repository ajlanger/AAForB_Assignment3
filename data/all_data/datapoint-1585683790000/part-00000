The facial characteristics are most prominent in infancy, becoming less apparent with age in many people with Noonan Syndrome.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Romano|first=Alicia A.|last2=Allanson|first2=Judith E.|last3=Dahlgren|first3=Jovanna|last4=Gelb|first4=Bruce D.|last5=Hall|first5=Bryan|last6=Pierpont|first6=Mary Ella|last7=Roberts|first7=Amy E.|last8=Robinson|first8=Wanda|last9=Takemoto|first9=Clifford M.|last10=Noonan|first10=Jacqueline A.|date=October 2010|title=Noonan syndrome: clinical features, diagnosis, and management guidelines|journal=Pediatrics|volume=126|issue=4|pages=746\u2013759|doi=10.1542/peds.2009-3207|issn=1098-4275|pmid=20876176|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/925a7045be88f743ffd2e9740b3e70bfe0c2466b}}</ref>\n\n===Head===\n\nSome of the characteristic features of Noonan syndrome include a [[large head]] with excess skin on the back of the neck, low hairline at the nape of the neck, high hairline at the front of the head, triangular face shape, broad forehead, and a short, webbed neck.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn the eyes, [[hypertelorism]] (widely set eyes) is a defining characteristic, present in 95% of people with Noonan syndrome. This may be accompanied by [[epicanthal fold]]s (extra fold of skin at the inner corner of the eye), [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] (drooping of the eyelids), [[proptosis]] (bulging eyes), [[strabismus]] (inward or outward turning of the eyes), [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] (jerking movement of the eyes) and refractive visual errors.\n\nThe nose may be small, wide, and upturned.\n\nThe development of the ears and auditory system may be affected in people with Noonan's syndrome. This can result in low-set ears (in over 90%), backward-rotated ears (over 90%), thick helix (outer rim) of ear (over 90%), incomplete folding of ears, chronic [[otitis media]] (ear infections), and hearing loss.\n\nDevelopment of the mouth may also be affected in Noonan syndrome. This can result in deeply grooved philtrum (top lip line) (over 90%), [[micrognathia]] (undersized lower jaw), high arched palate, articulation difficulties (teeth don't line up) which can lead to dental problems. Similar to the muscular manifestations above, in the mouth, poor tongue control may be observed.\n\n===Skin===\n\nSkin signs and symptoms in Noonan syndrome include [[lymphedema]] (lymph swelling of the extremities), [[keloid]] formation, excessive scar formation, [[hyperkeratosis]] (overdevelopment of outer skin layer), [[Nevus|pigmented nevi]] (darkly pigmented skin spots), and [[connective tissue disease]]\n\n===Musculoskeletal===\nAbnormalities in the limbs and extremities may occur in Noonan syndrome. This may manifest as bluntly ended fingers, extra padding on fingers and toes, [[edema]] of the back of hands and tops of feet, and [[cubitus valgus]] (wide carrying angle of the elbows).\n\nFor short stature, growth hormone is sometimes combined with IGF-1 (or as an alternative, IGF-1 as a stand-alone) can be used to achieve an increased height/final height quicker. The final adult height of individuals with Noonan syndrome is about 161\u2013167&nbsp;cm in males and 150\u2013155&nbsp;cm in females, which approaches the lower limit of normal.<ref name=\":11\">{{Citation|last=Allanson|first=Judith E.|title=Noonan Syndrome|date=1993|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1124/|work=GeneReviews\u00ae|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Margaret P.|publisher=University of Washington, Seattle|pmid=20301303|access-date=2019-11-18|last2=Roberts|first2=Amy E.|editor2-last=Ardinger|editor2-first=Holly H.|editor3-last=Pagon|editor3-first=Roberta A.|editor4-last=Wallace|editor4-first=Stephanie E.}}</ref>\n\nSpinal abnormalities may be present up to 30% of the time and this may require surgery to correct in over 60% of these cases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Other musculoskeletal manifestations in Noonan syndrome are associated with undifferentiated connective-tissue disorders which can be associated with joint contractures (tightness) or joint hypermobility (looseness).Additional factors may present in the form of winging of the scapula, scoliosis, breast bone prominence (pectus carinatum), breast bone depression (pectus excavatum) . Muscle abnormalities may present as hypotonia (low muscle tone) which may lead to lordosis (increased hollow in the back) due to poor abdominal muscle tone.\n\n===Heart===\n\nNoonan syndrome is the second most common syndromic cause of congenital heart disease. This includes pulmonary valvular stenosis (50\u201360%), atrial septal defects (10\u201325%), [[Ventricular septal defect|ventricular]] septal defects (5\u201320%) and [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] (12\u201335%).{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Lungs===\n\nRestrictive lung function has been reported in some people.\n\n===Gastrointestinal===\n\nA number of diverse gastrointestinal (SI) symptoms have been associated with Noonan syndrome. These include [[swallowing difficulties]], low gut motility, [[gastroparesis]] (delayed gastric emptying), [[intestinal malrotation]], and frequent or forceful [[vomiting]]. These digestive issues may lead to [[decreased appetite]], [[failure to thrive]] from infancy to puberty (75%), and occasionally the need for a feeding tube.\n\n===Genitourinary system===\n\nIn some males with Noonan syndrome, testicles do not descend ([[Cryptorchidism]]).\n\n===Circulation===\n\nLymphatic anomalies including Posterior cervical [[Cystic hygroma|hygroma]] (webbed neck) and [[Lymphedema]] may present in people with Noonan syndrome.\n\nA number of bleeding disorders have been associated with Noonan Syndrome, these include platelet dysfunction, [[Blood clotting]] disorders, partial deficiency of [[factor VIII]]:C, partial deficiency of [[factor XI]]:C, partial deficiency of [[factor XII]]:C, and an imbalance of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} It has been associated with [[Von Willebrand disease]], [[Thrombocytopenia|Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia]] (low platelet count), prolonged activated [[partial thromboplastin time]], combined [[coagulation defects]].

However, despite identification of 14 causative genes, the absence of a known mutation will not exclude the diagnosis, as  more, as-yet-undiscovered genes can cause NS. Thus, the diagnosis of NS is still based on clinical features. In other words, it is made when a physician feels that a person has enough of the features to warrant the label. The principal values of making a genetic diagnosis are that it guides additional medical and developmental evaluations, it excludes other possible explanations for the features, and it allows more accurate recurrence risk estimates. With more genotype-phenotype correlation studies being performed, a positive genetic diagnosis will help the clinician to be aware of possible anomalies specific to that certain gene mutation. For example, an increase in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is seen in people with a mutation of ''KRAS'' and an increased risk of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia exists for a mutation of ''PTPN11''. In the future, studies may lead to a targeted management of NS symptoms that depends on what genetic mutation a person has.\n\n===Before birth===\n\nPrenatal features that might lead physicians to consider a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome include cystic hygroma, increased nuchal translucency, pleural effusion, and edema.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\n\nWhile [[Turner syndrome]] has similarities with renal anomalies and developmental delay, Turner syndrome is only found in females and often expresses differently.

This may be accompanied by [[epicanthal fold]]s (extra fold of skin at the inner corner of the eye), [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] (drooping of the eyelids), [[proptosis]] (bulging eyes), [[strabismus]] (inward or outward turning of the eyes), [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] (jerking movement of the eyes) and refractive visual errors.\n\nThe nose may be small, wide, and upturned.\n\nThe development of the ears and auditory system may be affected in people with Noonan's syndrome. This can result in low-set ears (in over 90%), backward-rotated ears (over 90%), thick helix (outer rim) of ear (over 90%), incomplete folding of ears, chronic [[otitis media]] (ear infections), and hearing loss.\n\nDevelopment of the mouth may also be affected in Noonan syndrome. This can result in deeply grooved philtrum (top lip line) (over 90%), [[micrognathia]] (undersized lower jaw), high arched palate, articulation difficulties (teeth don't line up) which can lead to dental problems. Similar to the muscular manifestations above, in the mouth, poor tongue control may be observed.\n\n===Skin===\n\nSkin signs and symptoms in Noonan syndrome include [[lymphedema]] (lymph swelling of the extremities), [[keloid]] formation, excessive scar formation, [[hyperkeratosis]] (overdevelopment of outer skin layer), [[Nevus|pigmented nevi]] (darkly pigmented skin spots), and [[connective tissue disease]]\n\n===Musculoskeletal===\nAbnormalities in the limbs and extremities may occur in Noonan syndrome. This may manifest as bluntly ended fingers, extra padding on fingers and toes, [[edema]] of the back of hands and tops of feet, and [[cubitus valgus]] (wide carrying angle of the elbows).\n\nFor short stature, growth hormone is sometimes combined with IGF-1 (or as an alternative, IGF-1 as a stand-alone) can be used to achieve an increased height/final height quicker. The final adult height of individuals with Noonan syndrome is about 161\u2013167&nbsp;cm in males and 150\u2013155&nbsp;cm in females, which approaches the lower limit of normal.<ref name=\":11\">{{Citation|last=Allanson|first=Judith E.|title=Noonan Syndrome|date=1993|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1124/|work=GeneReviews\u00ae|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Margaret P.|publisher=University of Washington, Seattle|pmid=20301303|access-date=2019-11-18|last2=Roberts|first2=Amy E.|editor2-last=Ardinger|editor2-first=Holly H.|editor3-last=Pagon|editor3-first=Roberta A.|editor4-last=Wallace|editor4-first=Stephanie E.}}</ref>\n\nSpinal abnormalities may be present up to 30% of the time and this may require surgery to correct in over 60% of these cases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Other musculoskeletal manifestations in Noonan syndrome are associated with undifferentiated connective-tissue disorders which can be associated with joint contractures (tightness) or joint hypermobility (looseness).Additional factors may present in the form of winging of the scapula, scoliosis, breast bone prominence (pectus carinatum), breast bone depression (pectus excavatum) . Muscle abnormalities may present as hypotonia (low muscle tone) which may lead to lordosis (increased hollow in the back) due to poor abdominal muscle tone.\n\n===Heart===\n\nNoonan syndrome is the second most common syndromic cause of congenital heart disease. This includes pulmonary valvular stenosis (50\u201360%), atrial septal defects (10\u201325%), [[Ventricular septal defect|ventricular]] septal defects (5\u201320%) and [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] (12\u201335%).{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Lungs===\n\nRestrictive lung function has been reported in some people.\n\n===Gastrointestinal===\n\nA number of diverse gastrointestinal (SI) symptoms have been associated with Noonan syndrome. These include [[swallowing difficulties]], low gut motility, [[gastroparesis]] (delayed gastric emptying), [[intestinal malrotation]], and frequent or forceful [[vomiting]]. These digestive issues may lead to [[decreased appetite]], [[failure to thrive]] from infancy to puberty (75%), and occasionally the need for a feeding tube.\n\n===Genitourinary system===\n\nIn some males with Noonan syndrome, testicles do not descend ([[Cryptorchidism]]).\n\n===Circulation===\n\nLymphatic anomalies including Posterior cervical [[Cystic hygroma|hygroma]] (webbed neck) and [[Lymphedema]] may present in people with Noonan syndrome.\n\nA number of bleeding disorders have been associated with Noonan Syndrome, these include platelet dysfunction, [[Blood clotting]] disorders, partial deficiency of [[factor VIII]]:C, partial deficiency of [[factor XI]]:C, partial deficiency of [[factor XII]]:C, and an imbalance of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} It has been associated with [[Von Willebrand disease]], [[Thrombocytopenia|Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia]] (low platelet count), prolonged activated [[partial thromboplastin time]], combined [[coagulation defects]].

However, despite identification of 14 causative genes, the absence of a known mutation will not exclude the diagnosis, as  more, as-yet-undiscovered genes can cause NS. Thus, the diagnosis of NS is still based on clinical features. In other words, it is made when a physician feels that a person has enough of the features to warrant the label. The principal values of making a genetic diagnosis are that it guides additional medical and developmental evaluations, it excludes other possible explanations for the features, and it allows more accurate recurrence risk estimates. With more genotype-phenotype correlation studies being performed, a positive genetic diagnosis will help the clinician to be aware of possible anomalies specific to that certain gene mutation. For example, an increase in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is seen in people with a mutation of ''KRAS'' and an increased risk of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia exists for a mutation of ''PTPN11''. In the future, studies may lead to a targeted management of NS symptoms that depends on what genetic mutation a person has.\n\n===Before birth===\n\nPrenatal features that might lead physicians to consider a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome include cystic hygroma, increased nuchal translucency, pleural effusion, and edema.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\n\nWhile [[Turner syndrome]] has similarities with renal anomalies and developmental delay, Turner syndrome is only found in females and often expresses differently.
