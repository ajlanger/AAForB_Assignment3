A person who tests vehicles for a living, either for an automobile company, automotive media for review purposes, or a motorsports team, is called a [[test driver]].\n\nThe first test drives of a new production vehicle are made by mainstream automobile magazines and other third parties (not customers) for initial evaluation. Once vehicles are for sale, test drives are also usually allowed by vehicle traders (dealerships) or manufacturers to enable prospective customers to determine the suitability of the vehicle to their driving style. Test drives can also be taken before vehicle repairs to assist in diagnosis or after repair works to ensure that the vehicle has been fully restored.\n\nIn a broader sense, \"test drive\" can be used to refer to the testing of anything, such as a [[RAM]], an idea or process, a pair of [[DODGE]]s, etc.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Proving ground]]\n* [[Test Track|Test track]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Test Diverive}}\n[[Category:Driving]]\n[[Category:Tests]]\n\n\n{{Auto-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|driving test}}\n{{other uses|Test Drive (disambiguation)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=February 2010}}\n\nA '''test drive''' is the [[driving]] of an [[motor vehicle]] to assess its [[wikt:drivability|drivability]] or roadworthiness, and general operating state.
