The film was produced by K\u014dichir\u014d It\u014d and Katsuhiro Takei, with music composed by [[Radwimps]]. ''Your Name'' tells the story of Taki, a high school boy in [[Tokyo]] and Mitsuha, a high school girl in a rural town, who suddenly and inexplicably begin to [[Body swap|swap bodies]]. The film stars the voices of [[Ryunosuke Kamiki]], [[Mone Kamishiraishi]], [[Masami Nagasawa]] and [[Etsuko Ichihara]]. Shinkai's [[Your Name (novel)|eponymous novel]] was published a month before the film's premiere.\n\n''Your Name'' was distributed by [[Toho]]. It premiered at the [[Anime Expo|Anime Expo 2016]] convention in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on July 3, 2016, and in Japan on August 26, 2016. It was critically acclaimed for its animation, complex narrative, musical score, and emotional weight.

The film was followed by [[stand-alone sequel]] ''[[Weathering with You]]'' in 2019, in which Taki and Mitsuha appear in supporting roles. An American live-action remake set in the United States is currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\nMitsuha Miyamizu is a high school girl living in the town of Itomori in Japan's mountainous [[Hida region]]. She is bored with country life and wishes to be a handsome boy in her next life. She begins to [[Body swap|switch bodies]] intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo, when they wake up. They communicate by writing messages on paper, their phones, and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha causes Taki to develop a relationship with his coworker Miki, while Taki causes Mitsuha to become popular in school.\n\nOne day, Taki, as Mitsuha, accompanies her grandmother and sister to leave the ritual alcohol ''[[kuchikamizake]]'', made by Mitsuha, as an offering at the family [[Shinto shrine|shrine]] on a mountaintop outside the town. The shrine is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling human experiences and connections. Mitsuha's latest note tells Taki about the comet [[Tiamat]] expected to pass Earth on the day of her town [[Japanese festivals|festival]].\n\nThe next day, Taki wakes up in his body. After an unsuccessful date with Miki, he tries to call Mitsuha but cannot reach her, and the body-switching ends. He decides to meet her directly, but not knowing the town's name he has to rely on his memories of the scenery. A restaurant owner in Hida finally recognizes Itomori from Taki's sketch and tells him when the comet unexpectedly split into two; the larger piece kept moving, but the smaller one crashed onto Earth and destroyed the town. Looking at the site of the crater and while in disbelief that Mitsuha was dead this whole time, her messages on his phone disappear and his memories start fading away. Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the records of fatalities and discovers from the date of the disaster that their timelines were separated by three years.\n\nTaki goes to the shrine to drink Mitsuha's sake from the bottle, hoping to reconnect with her body and warn her about the comet strike. Through a vision, Taki discovers that the girl who acted like she knew him that he had encountered in the past was Mitsuha: not knowing they were separated by three years, she, having fallen in love with him, had met his past self while trying to meet with him personally. He wakes up in her body on the morning of the town festival; Mitsuha's grandmother deduces what is happening and tells him the body-switching is part of the family history as caretakers of the shrine. He convinces Mitsuha's friends, Tessie and Sayaka, to help evacuate the town by cutting the power and broadcasting a [[Broadcast signal intrusion|false emergency alert]], but the plan fails. Realizing that Mitsuha must be in his body at the shrine, he goes back to find her.\n\nMitsuha wakes up in Taki's body at the shrine. When Taki reaches the shrine as the sun is setting, the two sense each other's presence, but are separated by three years. However, when twilight falls (referred to in the film as \"magic hour\"),{{refn|group=\"note\"|\"Kataware-Doki,\" the word Taki and Mitsuha use, is turned from \"kawatare-doki,\" an old Japanese word meaning twilight. \"Kawatare\" (\u5f7c\u306f\u8ab0) literally means \"Who is he/she?\"; \"kataware\" also has the same sound as a word meaning one of the couple (\u7247\u5272\u308c). In old Japan, people believed that supernatural occurrences were possible at twilight.}} they return to their own bodies and meet. They attempt to write each other's names on their hands so they will remember each other, but twilight passes and Mitsuha disappears before she can write hers.\n\nAs Mitsuha races back to convince her father, the town mayor, to evacuate the town, her memories of Taki start to fade, and discovers that Taki wrote \"I love you\" on her hand instead of his name. The comet piece crashes to Earth, destroying the town. Taki wakes up in his own time, only to remember nothing.\n\nFive years later, Taki has graduated from university and is searching for a job. He senses he is missing something important, and learns that the inhabitants of the town survived by following the mayor's order. One day, Taki and Mitsuha see each other when their trains draw parallel, and are compelled to disembark and search for one another, finally meeting on a staircase. They initially walk past each other, before Taki uneasily asks Mitsuha if he had met her before, and she replies that she felt the same way: their connection reestablishing, they shed tears of happiness, and simultaneously ask for each other's names.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

The film was followed by [[stand-alone sequel]] ''[[Weathering with You]]'' in 2019, in which Taki and Mitsuha appear in supporting roles. An American live-action remake set in the United States is currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\nMitsuha Miyamizu is a high school girl living in the town of Itomori in Japan's mountainous [[Hida region]]. She is bored with country life and wishes to be a handsome boy in her next life. She begins to [[Body swap|switch bodies]] intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo, when they wake up. They communicate by writing messages on paper, their phones, and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha causes Taki to develop a relationship with his coworker Miki, while Taki causes Mitsuha to become popular in school.\n\nOne day, Taki, as Mitsuha, accompanies her grandmother and sister to leave the ritual alcohol ''[[kuchikamizake]]'', made by Mitsuha, as an offering at the family [[Shinto shrine|shrine]] on a mountaintop outside the town. The shrine is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling human experiences and connections. Mitsuha's latest note tells Taki about the comet [[Tiamat]] expected to pass Earth on the day of her town [[Japanese festivals|festival]].\n\nThe next day, Taki wakes up in his body. After an unsuccessful date with Miki, he tries to call Mitsuha but cannot reach her, and the body-switching ends. He decides to meet her directly, but not knowing the town's name he has to rely on his memories of the scenery. A restaurant owner in Hida finally recognizes Itomori from Taki's sketch and tells him when the comet unexpectedly split into two; the larger piece kept moving, but the smaller one crashed onto Earth and destroyed the town. Looking at the site of the crater and while in disbelief that Mitsuha was dead this whole time, her messages on his phone disappear and his memories start fading away. Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the records of fatalities and discovers from the date of the disaster that their timelines were separated by three years.\n\nTaki goes to the shrine to drink Mitsuha's sake from the bottle, hoping to reconnect with her body and warn her about the comet strike. Through a vision, Taki discovers that the girl who acted like she knew him that he had encountered in the past was Mitsuha: not knowing they were separated by three years, she, having fallen in love with him, had met his past self while trying to meet with him personally. He wakes up in her body on the morning of the town festival; Mitsuha's grandmother deduces what is happening and tells him the body-switching is part of the family history as caretakers of the shrine. He convinces Mitsuha's friends, Tessie and Sayaka, to help evacuate the town by cutting the power and broadcasting a [[Broadcast signal intrusion|false emergency alert]], but the plan fails. Realizing that Mitsuha must be in his body at the shrine, he goes back to find her.\n\nMitsuha wakes up in Taki's body at the shrine. When Taki reaches the shrine as the sun is setting, the two sense each other's presence, but are separated by three years. However, when twilight falls (referred to in the film as \"magic hour\"),{{refn|group=\"note\"|\"Kataware-Doki,\" the word Taki and Mitsuha use, is turned from \"kawatare-doki,\" an old Japanese word meaning twilight. \"Kawatare\" (\u5f7c\u306f\u8ab0) literally means \"Who is he/she?\"; \"kataware\" also has the same sound as a word meaning one of the couple (\u7247\u5272\u308c). In old Japan, people believed that supernatural occurrences were possible at twilight.}} they return to their own bodies and meet. They attempt to write each other's names on their hands so they will remember each other, but twilight passes and Mitsuha disappears before she can write hers.\n\nAs Mitsuha races back to convince her father, the town mayor, to evacuate the town, her memories of Taki start to fade, and discovers that Taki wrote \"I love you\" on her hand instead of his name. The comet piece crashes to Earth, destroying the town. Taki wakes up in his own time, only to remember nothing.\n\nFive years later, Taki has graduated from university and is searching for a job. He senses he is missing something important, and learns that the inhabitants of the town survived by following the mayor's order. One day, Taki and Mitsuha see each other when their trains draw parallel, and are compelled to disembark and search for one another, finally meeting on a staircase. They initially walk past each other, before Taki uneasily asks Mitsuha if he had met her before, and she replies that she felt the same way: their connection reestablishing, they shed tears of happiness, and simultaneously ask for each other's names.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n!
