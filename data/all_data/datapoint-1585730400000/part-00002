From the ''Roman de Fauvel''.]]\n{{italic title}}\nThe '''''Roman de Fauvel''''' is a 14th-century [[French language|French]] [[allegory|allegorical]] [[Poetry|verse]] [[Romance (poetry)|romance]] of satirical bent, generally attributed to Gervais du Bus, a clerk at the French royal [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]]. The original narrative of 3,280 [[octosyllabics]] is divided into two books, dated to 1310 and 1314 respectively, during the reigns of [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] and [[Louis X of France|Louis X]]. In 1316\u20137 [[Chaillou de Pesstain]] produced a greatly expanded version.\n\nThe romance features Fauvel, a [[fallow (color)|fallow]]-colored horse who rises to prominence in the French royal court, and through him satirizes the self-serving [[hedonism]] and hypocrisy of men, and the excesses of the ruling [[Estates of the realm|estates]], both secular and ecclesiastical. The antihero's name can be broken down to mean \"false veil\", and also forms an [[acrostic]] ''F-A-V-V-E-L'' with the letters standing for the human vices: Flattery, Avarice, Vileness, Variability (Fickleness), Envy, and Laxity. The romance also gave birth to the English expression \"curry fauvel\", the obsolete original form of \"[[wikt:curry favor|curry favor]]\". The work is reminiscent of a similar tract in the 13th-century ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', though owes more to the [[Beast fable|animal ''fabliaux'']] of [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]].\n\nChaillou's manuscript (Paris, [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|BN]] fr. 146) is a splendid work of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated art]], as well as being of considerable [[musicology|musicological]] interest due to interpolations of 169 pieces of music, which span the gamut of thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century genres and textures. Some of these pieces are linked to [[Philippe de Vitry]] and the nascent musical style referred to as ''[[Ars Nova]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe poem revolves around the central figure, an ambitious and foolish horse (or [[Ass (animal)|ass]]), called Fauvel. The horse's name itself is rife with symbolism. \"Fauvel\" comes from the color of its coat, which is \"muddy beige\"{{sfnp|Dillon|2002|p=15}} (or [[fallow (color)|fallow]]-colored){{r|oed-favel}}{{Refn|group=lower-alpha|The corresponding modern French ''fauve'' denotes a darker shade of brown, and the color has also been described by other commentators as \"[[fawn (colour)|fawn]]\"{{sfnp|Rosenberg|Tischler|1991|p=1}} or \"[[Dun (color)|dun]]\".{{sfnp|Regalado|1995a}}}} and symbolic of Vanity.{{sfnp|Dillon|2002|p=15}} The name breaks down to ''fau-vel'', or \"false veil\",{{sfnp|Dillon|2002|pp=14, 117}} and is furthermore an [[acronym]] F-A-V-V-E-L taken from the head letters of these vices: Flattery, Avarice, Vileness, Variability (Fickleness), Envy, and Laxity (''Flaterie'', ''Avarice'', ''Vilanie'', ''Variet\u00e9'', ''Envie'', ''Laschet\u00e9'').{{sfnp|Regalado|1995a}}{{r|morrison}}{{sfnp|Dillon|2002|p=14}}\n\nThe first book is a rebuke against the clergy and society, tainted by Sin and corruption.

He changes his residence to suit his needs, and has a custom manger and hayrack built.

She denies him, but in her stead she proposes he wed Lady Vainglory. Fauvel agrees, and the wedding takes place, with such guests present as Flirtation, Adultery, Carnal Lust, and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], in a technique similar to that of the [[Morality play]]s of the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nFinally, Dame Fortune reveals that Fauvel's role in the world is to give birth to more iniquitous rulers like himself, and to be a harbinger of the [[Antichrist]].\n\n==Text==\nThe ''Roman de Fauvel'' is a poem of 3280 [[octosyllabics|octasyllabic]] rhyming couplets,{{sfnp|Regalado|1995a}} divided into two books: Book 1 in 1226 verses, completed 1310 according to its last verse; and Book 2, in 2054 verses, completed 1314 according to its [[Explicit (disambiguation)|explicit]].{{sfnp|Rosenberg|Tischler|1991|p=1}}{{sfnp|Dillon|2002|pp=13, 87}} In 1316\u20137 Chaillou de Pe[s]stain (a still unidentified member of [[Chaillou|a family of bureaucrats]]){{sfnp|Rosenberg|Tischler|1991|p=2}} augmented this text with additional 3000 verses spanning both books (1800 lines of which are spent on Fauvel's wedding).{{sfnp|Regalado|1995a}}{{sfnp|Regalado|1995b|p=153}}{{sfnp|Rosenberg|Tischler|1991|p=2}}\n\n===Surviving copies===\n[[File:Roman de Fauvel.jpg|thumb|180px|Opening page (fol. 1r) from manuscript of ''Fauvel'', BN fr. 146.]]\nThe manuscript survives that contains Chaillou's expanded version in his own hand (Paris, [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|BN]] fr. 146), and this is the earliest copy of ''Fauvel'' to survive.

But there is one fragment L\u00e5ngfors did not include in his tally, and in 1994 M\u00fchlethaler published the existence of two previously unnoticed manuscript sources (1 complete copy and 1 fragment).{{sfnp|Dillon|2002|p=13}}{{sfnp|M\u00fchlethaler|1994|p=}}}} Chaillou's deluxe manuscript is illustrated with 78 miniatures, and inserts 169 musical pieces, woven into a complex ''mise-en-page''.\n\n==Music==\nOf all the surviving manuscript versions of Le Roman de Fauvel, the copy compiled by Chaillou de Pesstain (BN fr. 146), has attracted the most musicological attention due to the interpolated musical pieces in musical notation, which span the gamut of thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century genres and textures. The 169 pieces all have lyrics, 124 in [[Latin]], 45 in French.{{sfnp|Regalado|2007|p=236}}{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|Or 106 in [[Latin]], 60 in French, and 3 bilingual.{{sfnp|Regalado|1995b|p=153}}}}\nThe genres cover the liturgical and devotional, sacred and profane, monophonic and polyphonic, chant, old and new music. Some of these pieces are thought to have been composed by [[Philippe de Vitry]]. While these pieces were once thought of as arbitrarily selected repertory for textual \"accompaniment\",{{sfnp|Paris|1898|p=137}}{{sfnp|L\u00e5ngfors|1914}}{{sfnp|Gagnepain|1996}} recent scholarship (such as \"Fauvel Studies\" and Dillon's \"Music-Making\"){{sfnp|Dillon|2002}} has tended to focus on the ingenious intertextual/glossing role(s) played by musical notation \u2013 both visual and aural \u2013 in augmenting and diversifying the (political) themes of Gervais' ''[[admonitio]]''.{{sfnp|Herbelot|1998}} Amongst other curious discoveries are the inclusion of numerous \"false\" chants (Rankin) interspersed between actual liturgical material, perhaps a direct musical play on the deceptive qualities of its equine trickster. Much attention has also been paid to fr. 146's numerous polyphonic [[motets]], some of which (''In Nova Fert'', for example) exhibit red notation of newer mensural notational innovations generally described under the umbrella of [[ars nova]].\n\nAlthough the text of the ''Roman de Fauvel'' is not particularly well known, the music has been frequently performed and recorded. The question of how the entire work would have been read or staged in the 14th century is the subject of academic debate. Some have suggested that BN fr. 146 could have been intended as a theatrical performance.<!--Dankh-->{{sfnp|Herbelot|1998}} This hypothesis contradicts the concurrent opinion that the ''Roman de Fauvel'' is mainly an anthology.{{sfnp|Gagnepain|1996}} Modern performance projects, live and recorded, based on the BN 146 manuscript of the \"Roman de Fauvel,\" involving text, music, and at times staging or semi-staging, have been created by the Studio der Fruehen Musik, the Clemencic Consort, and The Boston Camerata, among others. Camerata's version has toured extensively in the U.S. and Europe, and was last seen at the 2011 Boston Early Music Festival.\n\n===Discography===\nThe first recording of the work has been made in 1972 by the [[Studio der Fr\u00fchen Musik]] (Studio of Early Music) on the EMI Reflexe \u2013 label, directed by [[Thomas Binkley]]. This recording is currently available as part of a 5-CD box-set on the Virgin-label. The speaker of the verses uses the original old-French, including some now very odd-sounding pronouncing of -still familiar- French words. It has been suggested that the musical interludes have some, especially for that time, poignant dissonances/counterpoint; which likely serve to illustrate the mocking nature of the whole Roman; the musical style of the polyphonies, nonetheless, are characteristic of the period in general.\n\nThe recording of the Roman de Fauvel by The [[Boston Camerata]], directed by [[Joel Cohen (musician)|Joel Cohen]]\n, was made in 1991 for Erato Disques. As of mid-2015, it was still available from Warner Classics. Erato also produced, the same year, a \"video book\" of the Roman de Fauvel. The video project was shown to audiences at the Louvre Museum, Paris, and at several conferences/colloquia; it was, however, never released commercially.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ars nova]]\n* [[Medieval music#France: Ars nova]]\n* [[Guillaume de Machaut]]\n* [[Philippe de Vitry]]\n* [[Allegory in the Middle Ages]]\n\n==Explanatory notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"anthology\">\n{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Roden |first1=Timothy |last2=Wright |first2=Craig |last3=Simms |first3=Bryan | chapter=26.

While these pieces were once thought of as arbitrarily selected repertory for textual \"accompaniment\",{{sfnp|Paris|1898|p=137}}{{sfnp|L\u00e5ngfors|1914}}{{sfnp|Gagnepain|1996}} recent scholarship (such as \"Fauvel Studies\" and Dillon's \"Music-Making\"){{sfnp|Dillon|2002}} has tended to focus on the ingenious intertextual/glossing role(s) played by musical notation \u2013 both visual and aural \u2013 in augmenting and diversifying the (political) themes of Gervais' ''[[admonitio]]''.{{sfnp|Herbelot|1998}} Amongst other curious discoveries are the inclusion of numerous \"false\" chants (Rankin) interspersed between actual liturgical material, perhaps a direct musical play on the deceptive qualities of its equine trickster. Much attention has also been paid to fr. 146's numerous polyphonic [[motets]], some of which (''In Nova Fert'', for example) exhibit red notation of newer mensural notational innovations generally described under the umbrella of [[ars nova]].\n\nAlthough the text of the ''Roman de Fauvel'' is not particularly well known, the music has been frequently performed and recorded. The question of how the entire work would have been read or staged in the 14th century is the subject of academic debate. Some have suggested that BN fr. 146 could have been intended as a theatrical performance.<!--Dankh-->{{sfnp|Herbelot|1998}} This hypothesis contradicts the concurrent opinion that the ''Roman de Fauvel'' is mainly an anthology.{{sfnp|Gagnepain|1996}} Modern performance projects, live and recorded, based on the BN 146 manuscript of the \"Roman de Fauvel,\" involving text, music, and at times staging or semi-staging, have been created by the Studio der Fruehen Musik, the Clemencic Consort, and The Boston Camerata, among others. Camerata's version has toured extensively in the U.S. and Europe, and was last seen at the 2011 Boston Early Music Festival.\n\n===Discography===\nThe first recording of the work has been made in 1972 by the [[Studio der Fr\u00fchen Musik]] (Studio of Early Music) on the EMI Reflexe \u2013 label, directed by [[Thomas Binkley]]. This recording is currently available as part of a 5-CD box-set on the Virgin-label. The speaker of the verses uses the original old-French, including some now very odd-sounding pronouncing of -still familiar- French words. It has been suggested that the musical interludes have some, especially for that time, poignant dissonances/counterpoint; which likely serve to illustrate the mocking nature of the whole Roman; the musical style of the polyphonies, nonetheless, are characteristic of the period in general.\n\nThe recording of the Roman de Fauvel by The [[Boston Camerata]], directed by [[Joel Cohen (musician)|Joel Cohen]]\n, was made in 1991 for Erato Disques. As of mid-2015, it was still available from Warner Classics. Erato also produced, the same year, a \"video book\" of the Roman de Fauvel. The video project was shown to audiences at the Louvre Museum, Paris, and at several conferences/colloquia; it was, however, never released commercially.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ars nova]]\n* [[Medieval music#France: Ars nova]]\n* [[Guillaume de Machaut]]\n* [[Philippe de Vitry]]\n* [[Allegory in the Middle Ages]]\n\n==Explanatory notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"anthology\">\n{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Roden |first1=Timothy |last2=Wright |first2=Craig |last3=Simms |first3=Bryan | chapter=26.
