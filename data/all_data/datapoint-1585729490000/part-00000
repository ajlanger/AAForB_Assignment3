Sometimes the sufferer will not be aware of what the alien hand is doing until it is brought to his or her attention, or until the hand does something that draws their attention to its behavior. There is a clear distinction between the behaviors of the two hands in which the affected hand is viewed as \"wayward\" and sometimes \"disobedient\" and generally out of the realm of their own voluntary control, while the unaffected hand is under normal volitional control. At times, particularly in patients who have sustained damage to the [[corpus callosum]] that connects the two [[cerebral hemispheres]] (see also [[split-brain]]), the hands appear to be acting in opposition to each other.<ref name=d>Revonsuo, Antti.

Activation of the primary motor cortex, presumed to be directly involved in the execution of the action via projections into the corticospinal component of the [[pyramidal tracts]], is then followed by activation of the [[posterior parietal cortex]], possibly related to the receipt of recurrent or ''re-afferent'' somatosensory feedback generated from the periphery by the movement which would normally interact with the [[efference copy]] transmitted from primary motor cortex to permit the movement to be recognized as self-generated rather than imposed by an external force.  That is, the efference copy allows the recurrent afferent somatosensory flow from the periphery associated with the self-generated movement to be recognized as ''re-afference'' as distinct from ''ex-afference''.  Failure of this mechanism may lead to a failure to distinguish between self-generated and externally generated movement of the limb.  This anomalous situation in which re-afference from a self-generated movement is mistakenly registered as ex-afference due to a failure to generate and successfully transmit an efference copy to sensory cortex, could readily lead to the interpretation that what is in actuality a self-generated movement has been produced by an external force as a result of the failure to develop a sense of agency in association with emergence of the self-generated movement (see below for a more detailed discussion).\n\nA 2007 fMRI study examining the difference in functional brain activation patterns associated with alien as compared to non-alien \"volitional\" movement in a patient with alien hand syndrome found that alien movement involved anomalous ''isolated'' activation of the primary motor cortex in the damaged hemisphere contralateral to the alien hand, while non-alien movement involved the normal process of activation described in the preceding paragraph in which primary motor cortex in the intact hemisphere activates in concert with frontal premotor cortex and posterior parietal cortex presumably involved in a normal cortical network generating premotor influences on the primary motor cortex along with immediate post-motor re-afferent activation of the posterior parietal cortex.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Assal | first1 = F.

It is generally thought that a movement is recognized as internally generated when the efference copy signal effectively \"cancels out\" the re-afference.  The afferent return from the limb is effectively correlated with the efference copy signal so that the re-afference can be recognized as such and distinguished from \"ex-afference\", which would be afferent return from the limb produced by an externally imposed force.  When the efference copy is no longer normally generated, then the afferent return from the limb associated with the self-generated movement is mis-perceived as externally produced \"ex-afference\" since it is no longer correlated with or canceled out by the efference copy.  As a result, the development of the sense that a movement is not internally generated even though it actually is (i.e. the failure of the sense of agency to emerge in conjunction with the movement), could indicate a failure of the generation of the efference copy signal associated with the normal premotor process through which the movement is prepared for execution.\n\nSince there is no disturbance of the ''sense of ownership'' of the limb (a concept discussed in the Wikipedia entry on [[sense of agency]]) in this situation, and there is no clearly apparent physically ostensible explanation for how the owned limb could be moving in a purposive manner without an associated sense of agency, effectively through its own power, a [[cognitive dissonance]] is created which may be resolved through the assumption that the goal-directed limb movement is being directed by an \"alien\" unidentifiable external force with the capacity for directing goal-directed actions of one's own limb.\n\n===Disconnection===\nIt is theorized that alien hand syndrome results when disconnection occurs between different parts of the brain that are engaged in different aspects of the control of bodily movement.<ref name = goldberg /> As a result, different regions of the brain are able to command bodily movements, but cannot generate a conscious feeling of self-control over these movements.  As a result, the \"sense of agency\" that is normally associated with voluntary movement is impaired or lost.  There is a dissociation between the process associated with the actual execution of the physical movements of the limb and the process that produces an internal sense of voluntary control over the movements, with this latter process thus normally creating the internal conscious sensation that the movements are being internally initiated, controlled and produced by an active self.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=Gary |last2=Goodwin |first2=Matthew E. |chapter=Alien Hand Syndrome |pages=84\u201391 |year=2011 |editor1-first=Jeffrey S. |editor1-last=Kreutzer |editor2-first=John |editor2-last=DeLuca |editor3-first=Bruce |editor3-last=Caplan |title=Encyclopedia of Clinical Neuropsychology |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-79948-3_1877 |isbn=978-0-387-79947-6 }}</ref>\n\nRecent studies have examined the neural correlates of emergence of the sense of agency under normal circumstances.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Spengler | first1 = S. | last2 = Von Cramon | first2 = D.

In alien hand syndrome, the neural mechanisms involved in establishing that this congruence has occurred may be impaired.  This may involve an abnormality in the brain mechanism that differentiates between \"re-afference\" (i.e., the return of kinesthetic sensation from the self-generated \"active\" limb movement) and \"ex-afference\" (i.e., kinesthetic sensation generated from an externally produced 'passive' limb movement in which an active self does not participate).  This brain mechanism is proposed to involve the production of a parallel \"efference copy\" signal that is sent directly to the somatic sensory regions and is transformed into a \"corollary discharge\", an expected afferent signal from the periphery that would result from the performance driven by the issued efferent signal.  The correlation of the corollary discharge signal with the actual afferent signal returned from the periphery can then be used to determine if, in fact, the intended action occurred as expected.

The overarching unitary conscious agent that emerges in the intact brain is based primarily in the dominant hemisphere and is closely connected to the organization of language capacity.  It is proposed that while relational action in the form of embodied intersubjective behavior<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trevarthen |first1=Colwyn |title=What is it like to be a person who knows nothing?

The possibility of purposeful action occurring outside of the realm of influence of the conscious dominant agent can occur and the basic assumption that both hands are controlled through and subject to the dominant agent is proven incorrect.  The [[sense of agency]] that would normally arise from movement of the nondominant limb now no longer develops, or, at least, is no longer accessible to consciousness.  A new explanatory narrative for understanding the situation in which the now inaccessible nondominant hemisphere based agent is capable of activating the nondominant limb is necessitated.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nUnder such circumstances, the two separated agents can control simultaneous actions in the two limbs that are directed at opposing purposes although the dominant hand remains linked to the dominant consciously accessible language-linked agent and is viewed as continuing to be under \"conscious control\" and obedient to conscious will and intent as accessible through thought, while the nondominant hand, directed by an essentially non-verbal agent whose intent can only be inferred by the dominant agent after the fact, is no longer \"tied in\" and subject to the dominant agent and is thus identified by the conscious language-based dominant agent as having a separate and inaccessible alien agency and associated existence.  This theory would explain the emergence of alien behavior in the nondominant limb and intermanual conflict between the two limbs in the presence of damage to the corpus callosum.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe distinct anteromedial, frontal, and posterolateral temporo-parieto-occipital variants of the alien hand syndrome would be explained by selective injury to either the frontal or the posterior components of the agency systems within a particular hemisphere, with the relevant and specific form of alien behavior developing in the limb contralateral to the damaged hemisphere.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\n===Corpus callosum===\nDamage to the [[corpus callosum]] can give rise to \"purposeful\" actions in the sufferer's non-dominant hand (an individual who is left-hemisphere-dominant will experience the left hand becoming alien, and the right hand will turn alien in the person with right-hemisphere dominance).\n\nIn \"the callosal variant\", the patient's hand counteracts voluntary actions performed by the other, \"good\" hand. Two phenomena that are often found in patients with callosal alien hand are ''agonistic dyspraxia'' and ''diagonistic dyspraxia''.\n\nAgonistic dyspraxia involves compulsive automatic execution of motor commands by one hand when the patient is asked to perform movements with the other hand. For example, when a patient with callosal damage was instructed to pull a chair forward, the affected hand would decisively and impulsively push the chair backwards.<ref name = caix/>\nAgonistic dyspraxia can thus be viewed as an involuntary competitive interaction between the two hands directed toward completion of a desired act in which the affected hand competes with the unaffected hand to complete a purposive act originally intended to be performed by the unaffected hand.\n\nDiagonistic dyspraxia, on the other hand, involves a conflict between the desired act in which the unaffected hand has been engaged and the interfering action of the affected hand which works to oppose the purpose of the desired act intended to be performed by the unaffected hand. For instance, when Akelaitis's patients underwent surgery to the corpus callosum to reduce epileptic seizures, one patient's left alien hand would frequently interfere with the right hand. For instance, while trying to turn over to the next page with the right hand, his left hand would try to close the book.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Akelaitis |first1=Andrew J. |title=Studies on the corpus callosum: IV.

The patient suffered from a ruptured [[aneurysm]] near the [[anterior cerebral artery]], which resulted in the right hand being mirrored by the left hand. The patient described the left hand as frequently interfering and taking over anything the patient tried to do with the right hand. For instance, when trying to grasp a glass of water with the right hand with a right side approach, the left hand would involuntary reach out and grasp hold of the glass through a left side approach.\n\nMore recently, Geschwind et al. described the case of a woman who suffered severe [[coronary heart disease]].<ref name=pmid7723974>{{cite journal |last1=Geschwind |first1=D.

Furthermore, he often could not let go of objects after grasping them with his palms. The other individual, a 47 year-old female who suffered an ACA in a different location of the artery, complained that her left hand would move on its own and she could not control its movements.

The patient displayed frequent grasp reflexes; her right hand would reach out and grab objects without releasing them. In regards to tonic grasping, the more the patient tried to let go of the object, the more the grip of the object tightened. With focused effort the patient was able to let go of the object, but if distracted, the behaviour would re-commence. The patient could also forcibly release the grasped object by peeling her fingers away from contact with the object using the intact left hand. Additionally, the hand would scratch at the patient's leg to the extent that an orthotic device was required to prevent injury.<ref name = goldberg /> Another patient reported not only tonic grasping towards objects nearby, but the alien hand would take hold of the patient's penis and engage in public masturbation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kischka |first1=U |last2=Ettlin |first2=TM |last3=Lichtenstern |first3=L |last4=Riedo |first4=C |title=Alien hand syndrome of the dominant hand and ideomotor apraxia of the nondominant hand |journal=European Neurology |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=39\u201342 |year=1996 |pmid=8719649 |doi=10.1159/000117198}}</ref>\n\n===Parietal and occipital lobes===\nA distinct \"posterior variant\" form of alien hand syndrome is associated with damage to the posterolateral [[parietal lobe]] and/or [[occipital lobe]] of the brain. The movements in this situation tend to be more likely to withdraw the palmar surface of the hand away from sustained environmental contact rather than reaching out to grasp onto objects to produce palmar tactile stimulation, as is most often seen in the frontal form of the condition.  In the frontal variant, tactile contact on the ventral surface of the palm and fingers facilitates finger flexion and grasp of the object through a positive feedback loop (i.e. the stimulus generates movement that reinforces, strengthens and sustains the triggering stimulation).\n\nIn contrast, in the posterior variant, tactile contact on the ventral surface of the palm and fingers is actively avoided through facilitation of extension of the fingers and withdrawal of the palm in a negative feedback loop (i.e. the stimulus, and even anticipation of stimulation of the palmar surface of the hand, generates movement of the palm and fingers that reduces and effectively counteracts and eliminates the triggering stimulation, or, in the case of anticipated palmar contact, decreases the likelihood of such contact). Alien movements in the posterior variant of the syndrome also tend to be less coordinated and show a coarse ataxic motion during active movement that is generally not observed in the frontal form of the condition. This is generally thought to be due to an optic form of ataxia since it is facilitated by the visual presence of an object with visual attention directed toward the object.  The apparent instability could be due to an unstable interaction between the tactile avoidance tendency biasing toward withdrawal from the object, and the visually based acquisition bias tendency pushing toward an approach to the object.\n\nThe alien limb in the posterior variant of the syndrome may be seen to \"levitate\" upward into the air withdrawing away from contact surfaces through the activation of anti-gravity musculature. Alien hand movement in the posterior variant may show a typical posture, sometimes referred to as a \"parietal hand\" or the \"instinctive avoidance reaction\" (a term introduced by neurologist [[Derek Denny-Brown (doctor)|Derek Denny-Brown]] as an inverse form of the \"magnetic apraxia\" seen in the frontal variant, as noted above), in which the digits move into a highly extended position with active extension of the interphalangeal joints of the digits and hyper-extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints, and the palmar surface of the hand is actively pulled back away from approaching objects or up and away from supporting surfaces.  The \"alien\" movements, however, remain purposeful and goal-directed, a point which clearly differentiates these movements from other disorganized non-purposeful forms of involuntary limb movement (e.g. [[athetosis]], [[Chorea (disease)|chorea]], or [[myoclonus]]).\n\n===Similarities between frontal and posterior variants===\nIn both the frontal and the posterior variants of the alien hand syndrome, the patient's reactions to the limb's apparent capability to perform goal-directed actions independent of conscious volition is similar.  In both of these variants of alien hand syndrome, the alien hand emerges in the hand contralateral to the damaged hemisphere.\n\n==Treatment==\nThere is no cure for the alien hand syndrome.<ref name=pmid1388978/> However, the symptoms can be reduced and managed to some degree by keeping the alien hand occupied and involved in a task, for example by giving it an object to hold in its grasp. Specific learned tasks can restore voluntary control of the hand to a significant degree. One patient with the \"frontal\" form of alien hand who would reach out to grasp onto different objects (e.g., door handles) as he was walking was given a cane to hold in the alien hand while walking, even though he really did not need a cane for its usual purpose of assisting with balance and facilitating ambulation.  With the cane firmly in the grasp of the alien hand, it would generally not release the grasp and drop the cane in order to reach out to grasp onto a different object. Other techniques proven to be effective includes; wedging the hand between the legs or slapping it; warm water application and visual or tactile contact.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nicholas |first1=John J. |last2=Wichner |first2=Monica H. |last3=Gorelick |first3=Philip B. |last4=Ramsey |first4=Michael M. |title='Naturalization' of the alien hand: Case report |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=113\u20134 |year=1998 |pmid=9440428 |doi=10.1016/S0003-9993(98)90218-0 }}</ref> Additionally, Wu et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=FY |last2=Leong |first2=CP |last3=Su |first3=TL |title=Alien hand syndrome: report of two cases |journal=Changgeng Yi Xue Za Zhi |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=660\u20135 |year=1999 |pmid=10695218 }}</ref> found that an irritating alarm activated by biofeedback reduced the time the alien hand held an object.\n\nIn the presence of unilateral damage to a single cerebral hemisphere, there is generally a gradual reduction in the frequency of alien behaviors observed over time and a gradual restoration of voluntary control over the affected hand.

Exactly how this may occur is not well understood, but a process of gradual recovery from alien hand syndrome when the damage is confined to a single cerebral hemisphere has been reported.<ref name = goldberg /> In some instances, patients may resort to constraining the wayward, undesirable and sometimes embarrassing actions of the impaired hand by voluntarily grasping onto the forearm of the impaired hand using the intact hand.  This observed behavior has been termed \"self-restriction\" or \"self-grasping\".<ref name = goldberg />\n\nIn another approach, the patient is trained to perform a specific task, such as moving the alien hand to contact a specific object or a highly salient environmental target, which is a movement that the patient can learn to generate voluntarily through focused training in order to effectively override the alien behavior.  It is possible that some of this training produces a re-organization of premotor systems within the damaged hemisphere, or, alternatively, that [[ipsilateral]] control of the limb from the intact hemisphere may be expanded.\n\nAnother method involves simultaneously \"muffling\" the action of the alien hand and limiting the sensory feedback coming back to the hand from environmental contact by placing it in a restrictive \"cloak\" such as a specialized soft foam hand orthosis or, alternatively, an everyday oven mitt. Other patients have reported using an orthotic device to restrict perseverative grasping<ref name = goldberg /> or restraining the alien hand by securing it to the bed pole.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Gordon |last2=Short |first2=Priscilla |last3=Mart\u00ednez |first3=Julio |last4=Latchaw |first4=Richard |last5=Ratcliff |first5=Graham |last6=Boller |first6=Fran\u00e7ois |title=The Alien Hand Syndrome |journal=Archives of Neurology |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=456\u20139 |year=1989 |pmid=2705906 |doi=10.1001/archneur.1989.00520400116030 }}</ref> Of course, this can limit the degree to which the hand can participate in addressing functional goals for the patient and may be considered to be an unjustifiable restraint.\n\nTheoretically, this approach could slow down the process through which voluntary control of the hand is restored if the neuroplasticity that underlies  recovery involves the recurrent exercise of voluntary will to control the actions of the hand in a functional context and the associated experiential reinforcement through successful willful suppression of the alien behavior.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n== History ==\nThe first known case described in the medical literature appeared in a detailed case report published in German in 1908 by the preeminent German neuro-psychiatrist, [[Kurt Goldstein]].<ref name=\"Goldstein1908\">{{cite journal |last1=Goldstein |first1=Kurt |year=1908 |title=Zur Lehre von der motorischen Apraxie |trans-title=On the doctrine of the motor apraxia |language=German |journal=Journal f\u00fcr Psychologie und Neurologie |volume=11 |issue=4/5 |pages=169\u2013187, 270\u2013283 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gZLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA169 }}</ref>  In this paper, Goldstein described a right-handed woman who had suffered a stroke affecting her left side from which she had partially recovered by the time she was seen.

Activation of the primary motor cortex, presumed to be directly involved in the execution of the action via projections into the corticospinal component of the [[pyramidal tracts]], is then followed by activation of the [[posterior parietal cortex]], possibly related to the receipt of recurrent or ''re-afferent'' somatosensory feedback generated from the periphery by the movement which would normally interact with the [[efference copy]] transmitted from primary motor cortex to permit the movement to be recognized as self-generated rather than imposed by an external force.  That is, the efference copy allows the recurrent afferent somatosensory flow from the periphery associated with the self-generated movement to be recognized as ''re-afference'' as distinct from ''ex-afference''.  Failure of this mechanism may lead to a failure to distinguish between self-generated and externally generated movement of the limb.  This anomalous situation in which re-afference from a self-generated movement is mistakenly registered as ex-afference due to a failure to generate and successfully transmit an efference copy to sensory cortex, could readily lead to the interpretation that what is in actuality a self-generated movement has been produced by an external force as a result of the failure to develop a sense of agency in association with emergence of the self-generated movement (see below for a more detailed discussion).\n\nA 2007 fMRI study examining the difference in functional brain activation patterns associated with alien as compared to non-alien \"volitional\" movement in a patient with alien hand syndrome found that alien movement involved anomalous ''isolated'' activation of the primary motor cortex in the damaged hemisphere contralateral to the alien hand, while non-alien movement involved the normal process of activation described in the preceding paragraph in which primary motor cortex in the intact hemisphere activates in concert with frontal premotor cortex and posterior parietal cortex presumably involved in a normal cortical network generating premotor influences on the primary motor cortex along with immediate post-motor re-afferent activation of the posterior parietal cortex.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Assal | first1 = F.

It is generally thought that a movement is recognized as internally generated when the efference copy signal effectively \"cancels out\" the re-afference.  The afferent return from the limb is effectively correlated with the efference copy signal so that the re-afference can be recognized as such and distinguished from \"ex-afference\", which would be afferent return from the limb produced by an externally imposed force.  When the efference copy is no longer normally generated, then the afferent return from the limb associated with the self-generated movement is mis-perceived as externally produced \"ex-afference\" since it is no longer correlated with or canceled out by the efference copy.  As a result, the development of the sense that a movement is not internally generated even though it actually is (i.e. the failure of the sense of agency to emerge in conjunction with the movement), could indicate a failure of the generation of the efference copy signal associated with the normal premotor process through which the movement is prepared for execution.\n\nSince there is no disturbance of the ''sense of ownership'' of the limb (a concept discussed in the Wikipedia entry on [[sense of agency]]) in this situation, and there is no clearly apparent physically ostensible explanation for how the owned limb could be moving in a purposive manner without an associated sense of agency, effectively through its own power, a [[cognitive dissonance]] is created which may be resolved through the assumption that the goal-directed limb movement is being directed by an \"alien\" unidentifiable external force with the capacity for directing goal-directed actions of one's own limb.\n\n===Disconnection===\nIt is theorized that alien hand syndrome results when disconnection occurs between different parts of the brain that are engaged in different aspects of the control of bodily movement.<ref name = goldberg /> As a result, different regions of the brain are able to command bodily movements, but cannot generate a conscious feeling of self-control over these movements.  As a result, the \"sense of agency\" that is normally associated with voluntary movement is impaired or lost.  There is a dissociation between the process associated with the actual execution of the physical movements of the limb and the process that produces an internal sense of voluntary control over the movements, with this latter process thus normally creating the internal conscious sensation that the movements are being internally initiated, controlled and produced by an active self.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=Gary |last2=Goodwin |first2=Matthew E. |chapter=Alien Hand Syndrome |pages=84\u201391 |year=2011 |editor1-first=Jeffrey S. |editor1-last=Kreutzer |editor2-first=John |editor2-last=DeLuca |editor3-first=Bruce |editor3-last=Caplan |title=Encyclopedia of Clinical Neuropsychology |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-79948-3_1877 |isbn=978-0-387-79947-6 }}</ref>\n\nRecent studies have examined the neural correlates of emergence of the sense of agency under normal circumstances.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Spengler | first1 = S. | last2 = Von Cramon | first2 = D.

In alien hand syndrome, the neural mechanisms involved in establishing that this congruence has occurred may be impaired.  This may involve an abnormality in the brain mechanism that differentiates between \"re-afference\" (i.e., the return of kinesthetic sensation from the self-generated \"active\" limb movement) and \"ex-afference\" (i.e., kinesthetic sensation generated from an externally produced 'passive' limb movement in which an active self does not participate).  This brain mechanism is proposed to involve the production of a parallel \"efference copy\" signal that is sent directly to the somatic sensory regions and is transformed into a \"corollary discharge\", an expected afferent signal from the periphery that would result from the performance driven by the issued efferent signal.  The correlation of the corollary discharge signal with the actual afferent signal returned from the periphery can then be used to determine if, in fact, the intended action occurred as expected. When the sensed result of the action is congruent with the predicted result, then the action can be labelled as self-generated and associated with an emergent sense of agency.\n\nIf, however, the neural mechanisms involved in establishing this sensorimotor linkage associated with self-generated action are faulty, it would be expected that the sense of agency with action would not develop as discussed in the previous section.\n\n===Loss of inhibitions===\nOne theory posed to explain these phenomena proposes that the brain has separable neural \"premotor\" or \"agency\" systems for managing the process of transforming intentions into overt action.<ref name = goldberg>{{cite journal |last1=Goldberg |first1=Gary |last2=Bloom |first2=Karen K. |title=The Alien Hand Sign |journal=American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=228\u201338 |year=1990 |pmid=2222983 |doi=10.1097/00002060-199010000-00002 }}</ref> An anteromedial frontal premotor system is engaged in the process of directing exploratory actions based on \"internal\" drive by releasing or reducing inhibitory control over such actions.\n\nA recent paper reporting on neuronal unit recording in the medial frontal cortex in human subjects showed a clear pre-activation of neurons identified in this area up to several hundred milliseconds prior to the onset of an overt self-generated finger movement and the authors were able to develop a computational model whereby volition emerges once a change in internally generated firing rate of neuronal assemblies in this part of the brain crossed a threshold.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fried |first1=Itzhak |last2=Mukamel |first2=Roy |last3=Kreiman |first3=Gabriel |title=Internally Generated Preactivation of Single Neurons in Human Medial Frontal Cortex Predicts Volition |journal=Neuron |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=548\u201362 |year=2011 |pmid=21315264 |pmc=3052770 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.11.045 }}</ref> Damage to this anteromedial premotor system produces disinhibition and release of such exploratory and object acquisition actions which then occur autonomously.

The overarching unitary conscious agent that emerges in the intact brain is based primarily in the dominant hemisphere and is closely connected to the organization of language capacity.  It is proposed that while relational action in the form of embodied intersubjective behavior<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trevarthen |first1=Colwyn |title=What is it like to be a person who knows nothing?

The possibility of purposeful action occurring outside of the realm of influence of the conscious dominant agent can occur and the basic assumption that both hands are controlled through and subject to the dominant agent is proven incorrect.  The [[sense of agency]] that would normally arise from movement of the nondominant limb now no longer develops, or, at least, is no longer accessible to consciousness.  A new explanatory narrative for understanding the situation in which the now inaccessible nondominant hemisphere based agent is capable of activating the nondominant limb is necessitated.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nUnder such circumstances, the two separated agents can control simultaneous actions in the two limbs that are directed at opposing purposes although the dominant hand remains linked to the dominant consciously accessible language-linked agent and is viewed as continuing to be under \"conscious control\" and obedient to conscious will and intent as accessible through thought, while the nondominant hand, directed by an essentially non-verbal agent whose intent can only be inferred by the dominant agent after the fact, is no longer \"tied in\" and subject to the dominant agent and is thus identified by the conscious language-based dominant agent as having a separate and inaccessible alien agency and associated existence.  This theory would explain the emergence of alien behavior in the nondominant limb and intermanual conflict between the two limbs in the presence of damage to the corpus callosum.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe distinct anteromedial, frontal, and posterolateral temporo-parieto-occipital variants of the alien hand syndrome would be explained by selective injury to either the frontal or the posterior components of the agency systems within a particular hemisphere, with the relevant and specific form of alien behavior developing in the limb contralateral to the damaged hemisphere.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\n===Corpus callosum===\nDamage to the [[corpus callosum]] can give rise to \"purposeful\" actions in the sufferer's non-dominant hand (an individual who is left-hemisphere-dominant will experience the left hand becoming alien, and the right hand will turn alien in the person with right-hemisphere dominance).\n\nIn \"the callosal variant\", the patient's hand counteracts voluntary actions performed by the other, \"good\" hand. Two phenomena that are often found in patients with callosal alien hand are ''agonistic dyspraxia'' and ''diagonistic dyspraxia''.\n\nAgonistic dyspraxia involves compulsive automatic execution of motor commands by one hand when the patient is asked to perform movements with the other hand. For example, when a patient with callosal damage was instructed to pull a chair forward, the affected hand would decisively and impulsively push the chair backwards.<ref name = caix/>\nAgonistic dyspraxia can thus be viewed as an involuntary competitive interaction between the two hands directed toward completion of a desired act in which the affected hand competes with the unaffected hand to complete a purposive act originally intended to be performed by the unaffected hand.\n\nDiagonistic dyspraxia, on the other hand, involves a conflict between the desired act in which the unaffected hand has been engaged and the interfering action of the affected hand which works to oppose the purpose of the desired act intended to be performed by the unaffected hand. For instance, when Akelaitis's patients underwent surgery to the corpus callosum to reduce epileptic seizures, one patient's left alien hand would frequently interfere with the right hand. For instance, while trying to turn over to the next page with the right hand, his left hand would try to close the book.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Akelaitis |first1=Andrew J. |title=Studies on the corpus callosum: IV.

The patient described the left hand as frequently interfering and taking over anything the patient tried to do with the right hand.

With focused effort the patient was able to let go of the object, but if distracted, the behaviour would re-commence.

The movements in this situation tend to be more likely to withdraw the palmar surface of the hand away from sustained environmental contact rather than reaching out to grasp onto objects to produce palmar tactile stimulation, as is most often seen in the frontal form of the condition.  In the frontal variant, tactile contact on the ventral surface of the palm and fingers facilitates finger flexion and grasp of the object through a positive feedback loop (i.e. the stimulus generates movement that reinforces, strengthens and sustains the triggering stimulation).\n\nIn contrast, in the posterior variant, tactile contact on the ventral surface of the palm and fingers is actively avoided through facilitation of extension of the fingers and withdrawal of the palm in a negative feedback loop (i.e. the stimulus, and even anticipation of stimulation of the palmar surface of the hand, generates movement of the palm and fingers that reduces and effectively counteracts and eliminates the triggering stimulation, or, in the case of anticipated palmar contact, decreases the likelihood of such contact). Alien movements in the posterior variant of the syndrome also tend to be less coordinated and show a coarse ataxic motion during active movement that is generally not observed in the frontal form of the condition. This is generally thought to be due to an optic form of ataxia since it is facilitated by the visual presence of an object with visual attention directed toward the object.  The apparent instability could be due to an unstable interaction between the tactile avoidance tendency biasing toward withdrawal from the object, and the visually based acquisition bias tendency pushing toward an approach to the object.\n\nThe alien limb in the posterior variant of the syndrome may be seen to \"levitate\" upward into the air withdrawing away from contact surfaces through the activation of anti-gravity musculature. Alien hand movement in the posterior variant may show a typical posture, sometimes referred to as a \"parietal hand\" or the \"instinctive avoidance reaction\" (a term introduced by neurologist [[Derek Denny-Brown (doctor)|Derek Denny-Brown]] as an inverse form of the \"magnetic apraxia\" seen in the frontal variant, as noted above), in which the digits move into a highly extended position with active extension of the interphalangeal joints of the digits and hyper-extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints, and the palmar surface of the hand is actively pulled back away from approaching objects or up and away from supporting surfaces.  The \"alien\" movements, however, remain purposeful and goal-directed, a point which clearly differentiates these movements from other disorganized non-purposeful forms of involuntary limb movement (e.g. [[athetosis]], [[Chorea (disease)|chorea]], or [[myoclonus]]).\n\n===Similarities between frontal and posterior variants===\nIn both the frontal and the posterior variants of the alien hand syndrome, the patient's reactions to the limb's apparent capability to perform goal-directed actions independent of conscious volition is similar.  In both of these variants of alien hand syndrome, the alien hand emerges in the hand contralateral to the damaged hemisphere.\n\n==Treatment==\nThere is no cure for the alien hand syndrome.<ref name=pmid1388978/> However, the symptoms can be reduced and managed to some degree by keeping the alien hand occupied and involved in a task, for example by giving it an object to hold in its grasp. Specific learned tasks can restore voluntary control of the hand to a significant degree. One patient with the \"frontal\" form of alien hand who would reach out to grasp onto different objects (e.g., door handles) as he was walking was given a cane to hold in the alien hand while walking, even though he really did not need a cane for its usual purpose of assisting with balance and facilitating ambulation.  With the cane firmly in the grasp of the alien hand, it would generally not release the grasp and drop the cane in order to reach out to grasp onto a different object. Other techniques proven to be effective includes; wedging the hand between the legs or slapping it; warm water application and visual or tactile contact.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nicholas |first1=John J. |last2=Wichner |first2=Monica H. |last3=Gorelick |first3=Philip B. |last4=Ramsey |first4=Michael M. |title='Naturalization' of the alien hand: Case report |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=113\u20134 |year=1998 |pmid=9440428 |doi=10.1016/S0003-9993(98)90218-0 }}</ref> Additionally, Wu et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=FY |last2=Leong |first2=CP |last3=Su |first3=TL |title=Alien hand syndrome: report of two cases |journal=Changgeng Yi Xue Za Zhi |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=660\u20135 |year=1999 |pmid=10695218 }}</ref> found that an irritating alarm activated by biofeedback reduced the time the alien hand held an object.\n\nIn the presence of unilateral damage to a single cerebral hemisphere, there is generally a gradual reduction in the frequency of alien behaviors observed over time and a gradual restoration of voluntary control over the affected hand.

This observed behavior has been termed \"self-restriction\" or \"self-grasping\".<ref name = goldberg />\n\nIn another approach, the patient is trained to perform a specific task, such as moving the alien hand to contact a specific object or a highly salient environmental target, which is a movement that the patient can learn to generate voluntarily through focused training in order to effectively override the alien behavior.  It is possible that some of this training produces a re-organization of premotor systems within the damaged hemisphere, or, alternatively, that [[ipsilateral]] control of the limb from the intact hemisphere may be expanded.\n\nAnother method involves simultaneously \"muffling\" the action of the alien hand and limiting the sensory feedback coming back to the hand from environmental contact by placing it in a restrictive \"cloak\" such as a specialized soft foam hand orthosis or, alternatively, an everyday oven mitt.
