The Ethiopian army became more effective against British colonial forces. The numerous expeditions of Ethiopian forces stopped colonial expansion. As the Russian [[Alexander Bulatovich]], one of the Russian military advisers and a participant in the expedition of the legendary army of Ras Wolde Giyorgis, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"Many consider the Abyssinian army to be undisciplined. They think that it is not in any condition to withstand a serious fight with a well-organized European army, claiming that the recent war with Italy doesn't prove anything. I will not begin to guess the future, and will say only this. Over the course of four months, I watched this army closely. It is unique in the world. And I can bear witness to the fact that it is not quite so chaotic as it seems at first glance, and that on the contrary, it is profoundly disciplined, though in its own unique way. For every Abyssinian, war is normal business, and military skills and rules of army life in the field enter in the flesh and blood of each of them, just as do the main principles of tactics. On the march, each soldier knows how to arrange necessary comforts for himself and to conserve his strength; but on the other hand, when necessary, he shows such endurance and is capable of action in conditions which are difficult even to imagine.\nYou see remarkable expediency in all the actions and skills of this army; and each soldier has an amazingly intelligent attitude toward managing the mission of the battle.\nDespite such qualities, because of its impetuousness, it is much more difficult to control this army than a well-drilled European army, and I can only marvel at and admire the skill of its leaders and chiefs, of which there is no shortage.\"<ref name=\"samizdat.com\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn obedience to the agreement with Russia and the order of Menelik II, First Ethiopian officers began to be trained at the First Russian cadet school in 1901. 30 to 40 Ethiopian officers were trained in Russia from 1901 until 1913.\n\n===Under Haile Selassie I===\n[[File:Ethiopian camel troops.jpg|thumb|right|Ethiopian troops transporting supplies by camel through vegetation during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]].]]\n{{Further|Ethiopian Order of Battle Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nModernization of the army took place under the regency of Tafari Mekonnen, who later reigned as Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]]. He created an [[Imperial Bodyguard]], the ''[[Kebur Zabagna]]'', in 1917 from the earlier ''[[Mahal Safari]]'' who had traditionally attended the Ethiopian Emperor. Its elite were trained at the French [[military academy]] at [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] or by Belgian military advisers. He also created his own military school at [[Oletta Military Academy|Holeta]] in January 1935.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=273}}\n\nEthiopian military aviation efforts were initiated in 1929, when Tafari Mekonnen hired two French pilots and purchased four French biplanes.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=279}} By the time of the Italian invasion of 1935, the air force had four pilots and thirteen aircraft.\n\nHowever, these efforts were not sufficient nor instituted in enough time to stop the rising tide of [[Italian fascism]]. Ethiopia lost its independence in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] of 1935-36, marked for the first time Ethiopia was colonized by a foreign power. The country regained its independence after the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|1941 East African Campaign]] of [[World War II]] with the intervention of British and British imperial forces. After the Italians had been driven from the country, a British Military Mission to Ethiopia (BMME), under Major General Stephen Butler, was established to reorganise the Ethiopian Army.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=7}} The Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of 1944 removed the BMME from the jurisdiction of [[East Africa Command]] at Nairobi and made it responsible to the Ethiopian Minister of War.<ref>Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay, 2006, 148.

A U.S. [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]] was dispatched to Ethiopia, and began its work by reorganising the army into three divisions.

Its members were not directly involved in those mutinies, nor was this the first military committee organized to support the administration of Prime Minister [[Endelkachew Makonnen]]: [[Alem Zewde Tessema]] had established the [[Armed Forces Coordinated Committee]] on 23 March. However, over the following months radicals in the Ethiopian military came to believe he was acting on behalf of the hated aristocracy, and when a group of notables petitioned for the release of a number of government ministers and officials who were under arrest for corruption and other crimes, three days later the Derg was announced.<ref>Marina and David Ottaway, ''Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution'' (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 52</ref>\n\nThe Derg, which originally consisted of soldiers at the capital, broadened its membership by including representatives from the 40 units of the [[Ethiopian Army]], [[Ethiopian Air Force|Air Force]], [[Ethiopian Navy|Navy]], [[Kebur Zabagna]] (Imperial Guard), [[Territorial Army (Ethiopia)|Territorial Army]] and [[Law enforcement in Ethiopia|Police]]: each unit was expected to send three representatives, who were supposed to be privates, NCOs and junior officers up to the rank of major. According to Bahru Zewde, \"senior officers were deemed too compromised by close association to the regime.\"<ref name=\"Bahru-234\">Bahru Zewde, 2000, p. 234</ref>\n\nThe committee elected Major [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as its chairman and Major [[Atnafu Abate]] as its vice-chairman.  The Derg was initially supposed to study the grievances of various military units, and investigate abuses by senior officers and staff, and to root out corruption in the military. In the months following its founding, the power of the Derg steadily increased. In July 1974 the Derg obtained key concessions from the Emperor, [[Haile Selassie]], which included the power to arrest not only military officers, but government officials at every level.  Soon both former Prime Ministers [[Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu Habte-Wold]], and [[Endelkachew Makonnen]], along with most of their cabinets, most regional governors, many senior military officers and officials of the Imperial court found themselves imprisoned.\n\nWhen the Derg gained control of Ethiopia, they lessened their reliance on the West. Instead they began to draw their equipment and their sources for organisational and training methods from the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Comecon]] countries, especially [[Cuba]]. During this period, Ethiopian forces were often locked in [[counter-insurgency]] campaigns against various [[guerrilla]] groups. They honed both conventional and guerrilla tactics during campaigns in Eritrea, and by repelling an invasion launched by [[Somalia]] in the 1977\u20131978 [[Ogaden War]].<ref>See Gebru Tareke, The Ethiopia-Somalia War of 1977 Revisited, [[The International Journal of African Historical Studies]], Vol. 33, No. 3 (2000), pp. 635-667.</ref>\n\nThe Ethiopian army grew considerably under the Derg (1974\u20131987), and the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] under Mengistu (1987\u20131991), especially during the latter regime. The [[Library of Congress]] estimated forces under arms in 1974 at 41,000.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} By July 1975 the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] was listing a mechanised division in addition to three infantry divisions.<ref>IISS 75-76, p.&nbsp;42</ref> Ayele writes that in November 1975, the \"Nabalbal\" (\"Flame\") force was created, subdivided into battalion-sized units of 400. Each battalion-sized unit was known as a ''hayl'' (force), and 20 were created within sixteen months.{{sfn|Ayele|2014p=55}} The \"Nabalbal\" units entered combat in 1977. When Ethiopian intelligence sources discovered Somali planning to seize the Ogaden, militia brigades were also created; first 30, then a total of 61 brigades totalling 143,350 by 1977-78.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=29-30}} It appears that there were five regular line divisions active by the time of the 1977 Ogaden War, and the [[Library of Congress]] estimated the force size at the time as 53,500. With significant Soviet assistance, after that point the army's size grew rapidly; in 1979 it was estimated at 65,000.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} The 18th and 19th Mountain Infantry Divisions were then established in 1979-80 originally to seize [[Nakfa, Eritrea|Nakfa]], in the [[Sahel (Eritrea)|Sahel Mountains]], one of the remaining strongholds of the Eritrean insurgents.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=31}} By the beginning of 1981 recruitment for the 21st and 22nd Mountain Infantry Divisions was underway; soon afterwards, preparations for the large [[Operation Red Star]] were stepping up.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=32-33}}\n\nIn April 1988 the Derg reorganised the army. The restoration of relations with Somalia meant that forces could be transferred from the First Revolutionary Army in the Ogaden, to the Second and [[Third Revolutionary Army|Third Revolutionary Armies]], the Third (TRA) being responsible for the provinces of Assab, Tigray, [[Wello]], [[Gondar]], and [[Gojjam]]. The very small Fourth Revolutionary Army became responsible not only for protecting the border with Kenya, but also those with Somalia and Sudan. In the place of the previous commands, thirteen [[corps]] were established instead, distributed amongst the army headquarters. Intensive efforts were made to enlist additional personnel. Total manpower after the reorganisation reached a reported 388,000.{{sfn|Fontanellaz|Cooper|2018|p=9}}\n\nIn May 1988 the Derg decided that before it could concentrate on destroying the EPLF, it would have to first eliminate the TPLF.{{sfn|Fontanellaz|Cooper|2018|p=13}} Thus Operation Adwa was devised to seize the main TPLF base at [[Adi Ramets]] in [[Gondar Province]]. The [[Third Revolutionary Army]]'s 603rd and 604th Corps were to play the main role, while the 605th Corps secured the rear, in [[Wello]]. The TRA's command structure was disrupted when Major General Mulatu Negash, the army commander, was supplanted by the arrival of Mengistu's favorite, Captain [[Lagesse Asfaw]].\n\nCuba provided a significant influx of military advisors and troops over this period, with the largest escalation during the Ogaden War with Somalia, supported by a Soviet airlift:{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=297-8}}\n* 1977\u20131978: 17,000 ([[Ogaden War]])\n* 1978: 12,000\n* 1984: 3,000\n* 1989: All forces withdrawn\n\n===1990-91 Order of Battle===\nGebru Tareke listed Ethiopian ground forces in 1990 as comprising four revolutionary armies organized as task forces, eleven corps, twenty-four infantry divisions, and four mountain divisions, reinforced by five mechanised divisions, two airborne divisions, and ninety-five brigades, including four mechanised brigades, three artillery brigades, four tank brigades, twelve special commando and paracommando brigades&nbsp;&ndash; including the Spartakiad, which became operational in 1987 under the preparation and guidance of North Koreans&nbsp;&ndash; seven [[Multiple rocket launcher|BM-rocket]] battalions, and ten brigades of paramilitary forces.<ref>Gebru Tareke, ''The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 120</ref>\n\nForces under arms were estimated at 230,000 in early 1991.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} Mengistu's People's Militia had also grown to about 200,000 members. The mechanized forces of the army comprised 1,200 [[T-54/55]], 100 [[T-62]] tanks, and 1,100 [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs), but readiness was estimated to be only about 30 percent operational, because of the withdrawal of financial support, lack of maintenance expertise and parts from the Soviet Union, Cuba and other nations.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278-9}}\n[[Image:T-55s civil war.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Ethiopian [[T-62]] tanks at the end of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]].]]\nThe army commands consisted of the:\n\n* First Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Harar]], 1988: 601st and 602nd Corps{{sfn|Fontanellaz|Cooper|2018|p=10}})\n* Second Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Asmera]], 1988: 606th-610th Corps)\n* Third Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Kombolcha]], 1988: 603rd, 604th, 605th Corps)\n* Fourth Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Nekemte]], 1988: 611th, 612th, 614th Corps)\n* Fifth Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Gondar]])<ref>Creation noted by \"Ethiopia: Mengestu Survives By His Fingertips\", ''[[Africa Confidential]]'' (London: Miramoor Publications, 3 November 1989)</ref>\n\nTo these armies were assigned the operational forces of the army, comprising:\n\n* 31 [[infantry division]]s.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} The 30th and 31st Infantry Divisions were the last formed, circa November\u2013December 1989.{{sfn|Fontanellaz|Cooper|2018|p=10}} There were also the [[102nd Airborne Division]] and [[103rd Commando Division]]s, which began training in January 1987.{{sfn|Fontanellaz|Cooper|2018|pp=18, 68}}\n* 32 [[tank]] [[battalion]]s\n* 40 [[artillery]] [[battalion]]s\n* 12 [[air defense]] [[battalion]]s\n* 8 [[commando]] [[brigade]]s\n\n===From 1991===\nIn 1991 Mengistu's government was overcome by the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF), [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ, former [[EPLF]]), [[Oromo Liberation Front]] (OLF) and other opposition factions. After the defeat of the military government, the provisional government disbanded the former national army and relied on its own guerrilla fighters.<ref name=LOCEth2005>Library of Congress Federal Research Division, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Ethiopia.pdf Country Profile: Ethiopia, April 2005], accessed July 2012</ref> In 1993, however, the Tigrayan-led government announced plans to create a multi-ethnic defense force. This process entailed the creation of a new professional army and officer class and the demobilization of many of the irregulars who had fought against the military government. With the collapse of the Soviet Union Ethiopia again turned to the Western powers for alliance and assistance. However, many Tigrayan officers remained in command positions. This transformation was still underway when war with [[Eritrea]] broke out in 1998, a development that saw the ranks of the armed forces swell along with defense expenditures.\n\nAlthough the armed forces have significant battlefield experience, their militia orientation has complicated the transition to a structured, integrated military.<ref name=LOCEth2005 /> Ranks and conventional units were only adopted in 1996. A United States-assisted effort to restructure the armed forces was interrupted by mobilisation for the war with Eritrea.\n\n====The Ethiopia-Eritrea war====\n[[Image:Afrimil-ethiopiansoldier.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Soldier of Ethiopian National Defense Force, 2006.]]\nThe former allies EPRDF and PFDJ (former EPLF) led their countries Ethiopia and Eritrea, respectively, into the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] of 1998.  The war was fought over the disputed region of [[Badme]]. During the course of the war, some commanders and pilots from the former army and air force were recalled to duty. These officers helped turn the tide decisively against Eritrea in 2000. Following the war's end, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission, a body founded by the UN, established that the Badme region had in fact belonged to Eritrea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/NewLinks/eebcarbitration/ |title=Recent Additions |accessdate=27 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130110233/http://www.un.org/NewLinks/eebcarbitration/ |archivedate=January 30, 2011 }}</ref> Although the two countries are now at peace, Ethiopia rejected the results of the international court's decision, and continued to occupy Badme. Most observers agree that Ethiopia's rejection of international law, coupled with the high numbers of soldiers maintained on the border by each side&nbsp;&ndash; a debilitatingly high number, particularly for the Eritrean side&nbsp;&ndash; means that the two countries are effectively still in conflict.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the Ethiopian army began to train with the U.S. [[Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) established in [[Djibouti]].

In December 2006, the ENDF entered Somalia to confront the Islamic Courts Union, initially winning the [[Battle of Baidoa]]. This led to the seizure of Mogadishu by Ethiopian troops and TFG militias, and subsequent heavy fighting there. After the Islamists split into two groups, moderate Islamists led by Sheikh Ahmed signed a UN backed peace deal with the TFG and established a larger government in Mogadishu. Ethiopian troops withdrew as part of the terms of the peace deal. Government forces have been engaged in battle against Ogaden insurgents led by the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]].\n\n[[Gabre Heard]] commanded the forces in Somalia. As of 2014, the Ethiopian troops in Somalia are being integrated into the [[AMISOM]] peacekeeping force. According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM is intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201311131037.html|title=Somalia: Ethiopia Decides to Join Amisom Force in Somalia|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> Analysts also suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It is believed that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination will help the allied forces advance their territorial gains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiiraan.com/news4/2013/Nov/52023/somali_war_expertise_and_superior_combat_kits_to_boost_anti_terror_campaign.aspx|title=Hiiraan Online: Somali war expertise and superior combat kits to boost anti-terror campaign|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Peacekeeping==\n\nEthiopia has served in various [[United Nations]] and [[African Union]] peacekeeping missions.

Many of its major weapons systems stem from the Communist era and are of Soviet and Eastern bloc design. The [[United States]] was Ethiopia's major [[arms industry|arms supplier]] from the end of the Second World War until 1977, when Ethiopia began receiving massive arms shipments from the Soviet Union.<ref>[[Library of Congress Country Studies]], [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+et0175%29 Ethiopia: Foreign Military Assistance]</ref> These shipments, including armored patrol boats, transport and jet fighter aircraft, helicopters, tanks, trucks, missiles, artillery, and small arms have incurred an unserviced Ethiopian debt to the former Soviet Union estimated at more than $3.5 billion.\n\nEthiopia made significant purchases of arms from Russia in late 1999 and early 2000 before the May 2000 United Nations arms embargo went into effect.<ref name=LOCEth2005 /> It is likely that much of that equipment suffered battle damage in the war with Eritrea.

The current minister of defense is Lemma Megersa.\n\nThe size of the ENDF has fluctuated significantly since the end of the [[Ethiopia-Eritrea war]] in 2000.

Ethiopia reacquired a coastline on the [[Red Sea]] in 1950 and created the [[Ethiopian Navy]] in 1955. [[Eritrea]]'s independence in 1991 left Ethiopia landlocked again, but the Ethiopian Navy continued to operate from foreign ports until it finally was disbanded in 1996.\n\n==History of the Army==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2009}}\nThe Ethiopian army's origins and military traditions date back to the earliest [[history of Ethiopia]]. Due to Ethiopia's location between the Middle East and Africa, it has long been in the middle of Eastern and Western politics, and has been subject to foreign invasion and aggression. In 1579, the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s attempt to expand from a coastal base at [[Massawa]] was defeated.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rising Tide of Cultural Pluralism: The Nation-State at Bay?|last=Rothchild|first=Donald|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=139}}</ref> The [[Army of the Ethiopian Empire]] was also able to defeat the Egyptians in 1876 at [[Battle of Gura|Gura]], led by Ethiopian Emperor [[Yohannes IV]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethiopiantreasures.co.uk/pages/yohannes.htm|title=Emperor Yohannes IV (1872-1889)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Clapham wrote in the 1980s that the \"Abyssinians [had suffered] from a 'superiority complex' which may be traced to Gundet, Gura and Adwa\".<ref>Clapham, Christopher 1987.

Leontiev formed the first regular battalion, the kernel of which became the company of volunteers from the former [[Senegal]] shooters, which he chose and invited from Western Africa, with training of the Russian and French officers.

The Ethiopian army became more effective against British colonial forces. The numerous expeditions of Ethiopian forces stopped colonial expansion. As the Russian [[Alexander Bulatovich]], one of the Russian military advisers and a participant in the expedition of the legendary army of Ras Wolde Giyorgis, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"Many consider the Abyssinian army to be undisciplined. They think that it is not in any condition to withstand a serious fight with a well-organized European army, claiming that the recent war with Italy doesn't prove anything. I will not begin to guess the future, and will say only this. Over the course of four months, I watched this army closely. It is unique in the world. And I can bear witness to the fact that it is not quite so chaotic as it seems at first glance, and that on the contrary, it is profoundly disciplined, though in its own unique way. For every Abyssinian, war is normal business, and military skills and rules of army life in the field enter in the flesh and blood of each of them, just as do the main principles of tactics. On the march, each soldier knows how to arrange necessary comforts for himself and to conserve his strength; but on the other hand, when necessary, he shows such endurance and is capable of action in conditions which are difficult even to imagine.\nYou see remarkable expediency in all the actions and skills of this army; and each soldier has an amazingly intelligent attitude toward managing the mission of the battle.\nDespite such qualities, because of its impetuousness, it is much more difficult to control this army than a well-drilled European army, and I can only marvel at and admire the skill of its leaders and chiefs, of which there is no shortage.\"<ref name=\"samizdat.com\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn obedience to the agreement with Russia and the order of Menelik II, First Ethiopian officers began to be trained at the First Russian cadet school in 1901. 30 to 40 Ethiopian officers were trained in Russia from 1901 until 1913.\n\n===Under Haile Selassie I===\n[[File:Ethiopian camel troops.jpg|thumb|right|Ethiopian troops transporting supplies by camel through vegetation during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]].]]\n{{Further|Ethiopian Order of Battle Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nModernization of the army took place under the regency of Tafari Mekonnen, who later reigned as Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]]. He created an [[Imperial Bodyguard]], the ''[[Kebur Zabagna]]'', in 1917 from the earlier ''[[Mahal Safari]]'' who had traditionally attended the Ethiopian Emperor. Its elite were trained at the French [[military academy]] at [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] or by Belgian military advisers. He also created his own military school at [[Oletta Military Academy|Holeta]] in January 1935.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=273}}\n\nEthiopian military aviation efforts were initiated in 1929, when Tafari Mekonnen hired two French pilots and purchased four French biplanes.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=279}} By the time of the Italian invasion of 1935, the air force had four pilots and thirteen aircraft.\n\nHowever, these efforts were not sufficient nor instituted in enough time to stop the rising tide of [[Italian fascism]]. Ethiopia lost its independence in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] of 1935-36, marked for the first time Ethiopia was colonized by a foreign power. The country regained its independence after the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|1941 East African Campaign]] of [[World War II]] with the intervention of British and British imperial forces. After the Italians had been driven from the country, a British Military Mission to Ethiopia (BMME), under Major General Stephen Butler, was established to reorganise the Ethiopian Army.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=7}} The Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of 1944 removed the BMME from the jurisdiction of [[East Africa Command]] at Nairobi and made it responsible to the Ethiopian Minister of War.<ref>Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay, 2006, 148.

A U.S. [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]] was dispatched to Ethiopia, and began its work by reorganising the army into three divisions.

Its members were not directly involved in those mutinies, nor was this the first military committee organized to support the administration of Prime Minister [[Endelkachew Makonnen]]: [[Alem Zewde Tessema]] had established the [[Armed Forces Coordinated Committee]] on 23 March. However, over the following months radicals in the Ethiopian military came to believe he was acting on behalf of the hated aristocracy, and when a group of notables petitioned for the release of a number of government ministers and officials who were under arrest for corruption and other crimes, three days later the Derg was announced.<ref>Marina and David Ottaway, ''Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution'' (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 52</ref>\n\nThe Derg, which originally consisted of soldiers at the capital, broadened its membership by including representatives from the 40 units of the [[Ethiopian Army]], [[Ethiopian Air Force|Air Force]], [[Ethiopian Navy|Navy]], [[Kebur Zabagna]] (Imperial Guard), [[Territorial Army (Ethiopia)|Territorial Army]] and [[Law enforcement in Ethiopia|Police]]: each unit was expected to send three representatives, who were supposed to be privates, NCOs and junior officers up to the rank of major. According to Bahru Zewde, \"senior officers were deemed too compromised by close association to the regime.\"<ref name=\"Bahru-234\">Bahru Zewde, 2000, p. 234</ref>\n\nThe committee elected Major [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as its chairman and Major [[Atnafu Abate]] as its vice-chairman.  The Derg was initially supposed to study the grievances of various military units, and investigate abuses by senior officers and staff, and to root out corruption in the military. In the months following its founding, the power of the Derg steadily increased. In July 1974 the Derg obtained key concessions from the Emperor, [[Haile Selassie]], which included the power to arrest not only military officers, but government officials at every level.  Soon both former Prime Ministers [[Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu Habte-Wold]], and [[Endelkachew Makonnen]], along with most of their cabinets, most regional governors, many senior military officers and officials of the Imperial court found themselves imprisoned.\n\nWhen the Derg gained control of Ethiopia, they lessened their reliance on the West. Instead they began to draw their equipment and their sources for organisational and training methods from the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Comecon]] countries, especially [[Cuba]]. During this period, Ethiopian forces were often locked in [[counter-insurgency]] campaigns against various [[guerrilla]] groups. They honed both conventional and guerrilla tactics during campaigns in Eritrea, and by repelling an invasion launched by [[Somalia]] in the 1977\u20131978 [[Ogaden War]].<ref>See Gebru Tareke, The Ethiopia-Somalia War of 1977 Revisited, [[The International Journal of African Historical Studies]], Vol. 33, No. 3 (2000), pp. 635-667.</ref>\n\nThe Ethiopian army grew considerably under the Derg (1974\u20131987), and the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] under Mengistu (1987\u20131991), especially during the latter regime. The [[Library of Congress]] estimated forces under arms in 1974 at 41,000.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} By July 1975 the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] was listing a mechanised division in addition to three infantry divisions.<ref>IISS 75-76, p.&nbsp;42</ref> Ayele writes that in November 1975, the \"Nabalbal\" (\"Flame\") force was created, subdivided into battalion-sized units of 400. Each battalion-sized unit was known as a ''hayl'' (force), and 20 were created within sixteen months.{{sfn|Ayele|2014p=55}} The \"Nabalbal\" units entered combat in 1977. When Ethiopian intelligence sources discovered Somali planning to seize the Ogaden, militia brigades were also created; first 30, then a total of 61 brigades totalling 143,350 by 1977-78.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=29-30}} It appears that there were five regular line divisions active by the time of the 1977 Ogaden War, and the [[Library of Congress]] estimated the force size at the time as 53,500. With significant Soviet assistance, after that point the army's size grew rapidly; in 1979 it was estimated at 65,000.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} The 18th and 19th Mountain Infantry Divisions were then established in 1979-80 originally to seize [[Nakfa, Eritrea|Nakfa]], in the [[Sahel (Eritrea)|Sahel Mountains]], one of the remaining strongholds of the Eritrean insurgents.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=31}} By the beginning of 1981 recruitment for the 21st and 22nd Mountain Infantry Divisions was underway; soon afterwards, preparations for the large [[Operation Red Star]] were stepping up.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=32-33}}\n\nIn April 1988 the Derg reorganised the army. The restoration of relations with Somalia meant that forces could be transferred from the First Revolutionary Army in the Ogaden, to the Second and [[Third Revolutionary Army|Third Revolutionary Armies]], the Third (TRA) being responsible for the provinces of Assab, Tigray, [[Wello]], [[Gondar]], and [[Gojjam]]. The very small Fourth Revolutionary Army became responsible not only for protecting the border with Kenya, but also those with Somalia and Sudan. In the place of the previous commands, thirteen [[corps]] were established instead, distributed amongst the army headquarters. Intensive efforts were made to enlist additional personnel. Total manpower after the reorganisation reached a reported 388,000.{{sfn|Fontanellaz|Cooper|2018|p=9}}\n\nIn May 1988 the Derg decided that before it could concentrate on destroying the EPLF, it would have to first eliminate the TPLF.{{sfn|Fontanellaz|Cooper|2018|p=13}} Thus Operation Adwa was devised to seize the main TPLF base at [[Adi Ramets]] in [[Gondar Province]]. The [[Third Revolutionary Army]]'s 603rd and 604th Corps were to play the main role, while the 605th Corps secured the rear, in [[Wello]]. The TRA's command structure was disrupted when Major General Mulatu Negash, the army commander, was supplanted by the arrival of Mengistu's favorite, Captain [[Lagesse Asfaw]].\n\nCuba provided a significant influx of military advisors and troops over this period, with the largest escalation during the Ogaden War with Somalia, supported by a Soviet airlift:{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=297-8}}\n* 1977\u20131978: 17,000 ([[Ogaden War]])\n* 1978: 12,000\n* 1984: 3,000\n* 1989: All forces withdrawn\n\n===1990-91 Order of Battle===\nGebru Tareke listed Ethiopian ground forces in 1990 as comprising four revolutionary armies organized as task forces, eleven corps, twenty-four infantry divisions, and four mountain divisions, reinforced by five mechanised divisions, two airborne divisions, and ninety-five brigades, including four mechanised brigades, three artillery brigades, four tank brigades, twelve special commando and paracommando brigades&nbsp;&ndash; including the Spartakiad, which became operational in 1987 under the preparation and guidance of North Koreans&nbsp;&ndash; seven [[Multiple rocket launcher|BM-rocket]] battalions, and ten brigades of paramilitary forces.<ref>Gebru Tareke, ''The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 120</ref> \n\nForces under arms were estimated at 230,000 in early 1991.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} Mengistu's People's Militia had also grown to about 200,000 members.

The war was fought over the disputed region of [[Badme]]. During the course of the war, some commanders and pilots from the former army and air force were recalled to duty. These officers helped turn the tide decisively against Eritrea in 2000. Following the war's end, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission, a body founded by the UN, established that the Badme region had in fact belonged to Eritrea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/NewLinks/eebcarbitration/ |title=Recent Additions |accessdate=27 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130110233/http://www.un.org/NewLinks/eebcarbitration/ |archivedate=January 30, 2011 }}</ref> Although the two countries are now at peace, Ethiopia rejected the results of the international court's decision, and continued to occupy Badme. Most observers agree that Ethiopia's rejection of international law, coupled with the high numbers of soldiers maintained on the border by each side&nbsp;&ndash; a debilitatingly high number, particularly for the Eritrean side&nbsp;&ndash; means that the two countries are effectively still in conflict.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the Ethiopian army began to train with the U.S. [[Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) established in [[Djibouti]]. Ethiopia allowed the US to station military advisors at [[Camp Hurso]].<ref name=\"US-TRAINERS-PREPARE-ETHIOPIANS-TO-FIGHT\">{{cite news|url=http://stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=41429&archive=true|title=U.S. trainers prepare Ethiopians to fight|newspaper=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|date=2006-12-30|accessdate=2007-01-14 }}</ref> Part of the training at Camp Hurso has included U.S. Army elements, including 4th Battalion, [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry]], training the 12th, 13th and 14th Division Reconnaissance Companies, which from July 2003 were being formed into a new Ethiopian anti-terrorism battalion.<ref>Memo: Meritorious Unit Commendation for 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry, 2d Brigade, 10th Mountain Division (LI), Fort Drum, NY 13602, from 2nd Brigade, 10th MD(LI), 21 January 2004, downloaded from Internet and accessed mid September 2007.</ref>\n\n====Somalia====\nEthiopian troops helped drive the [[Islamic Courts Union]] out of Mogadishu in Somalia. In December 2006, the ENDF entered Somalia to confront the Islamic Courts Union, initially winning the [[Battle of Baidoa]]. This led to the seizure of Mogadishu by Ethiopian troops and TFG militias, and subsequent heavy fighting there. After the Islamists split into two groups, moderate Islamists led by Sheikh Ahmed signed a UN backed peace deal with the TFG and established a larger government in Mogadishu. Ethiopian troops withdrew as part of the terms of the peace deal. Government forces have been engaged in battle against Ogaden insurgents led by the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]].\n\n[[Gabre Heard]] commanded the forces in Somalia. As of 2014, the Ethiopian troops in Somalia are being integrated into the [[AMISOM]] peacekeeping force. According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM is intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201311131037.html|title=Somalia: Ethiopia Decides to Join Amisom Force in Somalia|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> Analysts also suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It is believed that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination will help the allied forces advance their territorial gains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiiraan.com/news4/2013/Nov/52023/somali_war_expertise_and_superior_combat_kits_to_boost_anti_terror_campaign.aspx|title=Hiiraan Online: Somali war expertise and superior combat kits to boost anti-terror campaign|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Peacekeeping==\n\nEthiopia has served in various [[United Nations]] and [[African Union]] peacekeeping missions.

Many of its major weapons systems stem from the Communist era and are of Soviet and Eastern bloc design. The [[United States]] was Ethiopia's major [[arms industry|arms supplier]] from the end of the Second World War until 1977, when Ethiopia began receiving massive arms shipments from the Soviet Union.<ref>[[Library of Congress Country Studies]], [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+et0175%29 Ethiopia: Foreign Military Assistance]</ref> These shipments, including armored patrol boats, transport and jet fighter aircraft, helicopters, tanks, trucks, missiles, artillery, and small arms have incurred an unserviced Ethiopian debt to the former Soviet Union estimated at more than $3.5 billion.\n\nEthiopia made significant purchases of arms from Russia in late 1999 and early 2000 before the May 2000 United Nations arms embargo went into effect.<ref name=LOCEth2005 /> It is likely that much of that equipment suffered battle damage in the war with Eritrea. Thus, raw numbers alone will probably overstate the capacity of the ENDF.\n\n===Modern ground forces equipment===\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.
