He headed the notorious [[Rizzuto crime family]] based in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada.\n\nRizzuto was born in [[Cattolica Eraclea]], Sicily, Italy in 1946 and immigrated to Montreal with his parents in 1954. His father [[Nicolo Rizzuto|Nicolo]] married into the mob, and later started his own crime syndicate in Montreal after overtaking the [[Cotroni crime family]] in the late 1970s. He had several run-ins with the law but was able to avoid conviction for any major offenses until 2004. In 1981, Rizzuto participated in the killing of three rival capos in New York City ordered by [[Joe Massino]] of the [[Bonanno crime family]], and he was indicted by a Brooklyn federal grand jury in connection with these killings in 2004. He was extradited to the United States in 2006, and pled guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and racketeering charges in 2007. He was given a 10-year prison sentence, but was released in late 2012. The Rizzuto crime family was in the midst of a power struggle while Rizzuto was jailed; his son Nicolo Jr. was killed in 2009, and his father was killed in 2010.
