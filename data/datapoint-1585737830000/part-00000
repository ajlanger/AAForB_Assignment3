In this transition, the sole criterion for production is [[use-value]] (i.e. direct satisfaction of human needs, or economic demands), therefore the [[law of value]] no longer directs economic activity. Marxist [[production for use]] is coordinated through conscious [[economic planning]]. Distribution of products is based on the principle of \"[[to each according to his contribution]]\". The social relations of socialism are characterized by the [[proletariat]] effectively controlling the [[means of production]], either through [[Cooperative|cooperative enterprises]] or by [[public ownership]] or private artisanal tools and [[Organizational self-management|self-management]].

Instead, Marx called it a communist society that has not yet reached its higher-stage.<ref name=\"GothaCritique\"/> The term socialism was popularized during the [[Russian Revolution]] by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. This view is consistent with and helped to inform early concepts of socialism in which the law of value no longer directs economic activity.

Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society \u2013 after the deductions have been made \u2013 exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.<ref name=\"GothaCritique\"/>}}\n\nSocialism is a post-[[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] economic system. and production is carried out to directly produce [[use-value]] rather than toward generating [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. The [[accumulation of capital]] is rendered insufficient in socialism as production is carried out independently of capital accumulation in a planned fashion. However, there have been other concepts of economic planning, including [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralised]] and [[participatory planning]]. One of Marx's main manuscripts is a posthumous work called ''[[Grundrisse]]'', published in 1953. In this work, Marx's thinking is explored regarding production, consumption, distribution, social impact of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]]. [[Communist society|Communism]] is considered as a living model for humans after capitalism. The emphasis is upon fair distribution of goods, equality and the optimum environment for humans to live in to develop themselves to their best capabilities (art, politics and philosophy, among others) to achieve happiness and to satisfy intrinsic needs. Marx's goal was to design a social system that eliminates the differences in [[Social class|classes]] between the [[proletariat]] and the [[bourgeoisie]]. In doing so, the tension and the power differences which force workers to labor in bad conditions for poor wages, disappear. According to Marx, capitalism is a system guaranteed to collapse because [[Big business|big companies]] would buy [[Small business|small companies]], leading to [[monopoly]]. In such a scenario, a very small number of people control most of the [[money]] and [[wikt:power|power]]. Poverty for the masses would prevail. Significant capital to buy products from the capitalist production system would be unavailable. Marx postulated that if workers are paid enough so that they still are able to buy products in a capitalist market, they will become essential contributors in assuring the [[Economic globalization|domination of capitalism worldwide]].\n\n[[Market (economics)|Market]] forces to compel capitalists to produce [[use-values]] in pursuit of exchange-value. Socialist production involves rational planning of use-values and coordination of investment decisions to attain economic goals.<ref>Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell (1998). \"The Difference Between Marxism and Market Socialism\". ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. p. 61\u201363. \"More fundamentally, a socialist society must be one in which the economy is run on the principle of the direct satisfaction of human needs. [...] Exchange-value, prices and so money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market. There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology. [...] It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality.\"</ref> In this approach, [[Business cycle|cyclical fluctuations]] that occur in a capitalist [[market economy]] do not exist in a socialist economy. The value of a good in socialism is its physical utility rather than its embodied labour, cost of production and exchange value as in a capitalist system. Socialism makes use of incentive-based systems, so inequality would still exist, but diminishingly so since workers are worker-owners. In this way, inequality is also diminished and capital and power is more widely distributed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-socialism-and-scientific.html|title=Karl Marx Socialism and Scientific Communism|publisher=Economic Theories|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref> The method of compensation and reward in a socialist society would be based on an authentic [[meritocracy]]{{citation needed|reason=The claim of meritocracy seems to be at odds with this paragraph and the Critique of the Gotha Programme from which it largely draws|date=October 2019}} along the principle of \"[[To each according to his contribution|From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution]]\".<ref name=\"GothaCritique\"/>\n\nThe advanced stage of socialism, referred to as the upper-stage communism in the ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'', is based on the socialist mode of production. However, it is different from lower-stage socialism in fundamental ways. While [[socialism]] implies [[public ownership]] (by a [[Proletarian state|proletarian semi-state]] apparatus) or [[cooperative ownership]] (by a [[worker cooperative]] enterprise), communism would be based on [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. Class distinctions based on [[ownership]] of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] cease to exist, along with the need for a state. A [[Post-scarcity economy|superabundance]] of [[goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] are made possible by [[Automation|automated production]] that allow for goods to be distributed based on need rather than merit.<ref>Marx, Karl (1875). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm \"Part 1\"]. ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]''. \"In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly \u2013 only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\"</ref>\n\n== Social relations ==\nThe fundamental goal of socialism from the view of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] was the realization of [[human freedom]] and [[individual autonomy]]. Specifically, this refers to [[Liberty|freedom]] from the [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] imposed upon [[individuals]] in the form of coercive [[social relations]] as well as material [[scarcity]], whereby the individual is compelled to engage in activities merely to survive to reproduce his or herself. The aim of socialism is to provide an environment whereby individuals are free to express their genuine interests, creative freedom and desires unhindered by forms of social control that force individuals to work for a class of owners who expropriate and live off the [[surplus product]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/ch06.htm|title=Marx's Concept Of Socialism|last=Fromm|first=Erich|year=1961|work=Marx's Concept of Man|publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs a set of social relations, socialism is defined by the degree to which economic activity in society is planned by the [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|associated producers]] so that the surplus product produced by socialised assets is controlled by a majority of the population through democratic processes. The sale of [[labour power]] would be abolished so that every individual participates in running their institution as stakeholders or members with no one having coercive power over anyone else in a vertical social [[division of labour]] which is to be distinguished from a non-social, technical division of labour which would still exist in socialism.<ref>Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell (1998). \"Definitions of market and socialism\". ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. pp. 58\u201359. \"For an Anti-Stalinist Marxist, socialism is defined by the degree to which the society is planned. Planning here is understood as the conscious regulation of society by the associated producers themselves. Put it differently, the control over the surplus product rests with the majority of the population through a resolutely democratic process. [...] The sale of labour power is abolished and labour necessarily becomes creative. Everyone participates in running their institutions and society as a whole. No one controls anyone else.\"</ref> The incentive structure changes in a socialist society given the change in the social environment so that an individual labourers' work becomes increasingly autonomous and creative, creating a sense of responsibility for his or her institution as a stakeholder.\n\n=== Role of the state ===\nIn Marxist theory, the [[State (polity)|state]] is \"the institution of organised violence which is used by the [[ruling class]] of a country to maintain the conditions of its rule. Thus, it is only in a society which is divided between hostile social classes that the state exists\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/t.htm#state|title=State|work=Glossary of Terms|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref> The state is seen as a mechanism dominated by the interests of the ruling class. It subjugates other classes, to protect and legitimize the existing [[economic system]].\n\nAfter a [[proletarian revolution]], the state would initially become the instrument of the [[proletariat]]. Conquest of the state by the proletariat is a prerequisite to establishing a socialist system. As socialism is built, the role and scope of the state changes. Class distinctions, based on ownership of the means of production, gradually deteriorate. The concentration of means of production increasingly falls into state hands. Once all means of production become state property, the primary function of the state changes. Political rule via coercion over men diminishes through the creation and enforcement of laws, scientific administration and the direction of the processes of production. As a result, the state becomes an entity of economic coordination rather than a mechanism of class or political control and is no longer a state in the Marxian sense.<ref>Engels, Friedrich (1880).

Marxists Internet Archive. \"In 1816, he declares that politics is the science of production, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics. The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis of political institutions appears here only in embryo. Yet what is here already very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion of political rule over men into an administration of things and a direction of processes of production.\"</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|Capitalist mode of production]]\n* [[Communism#Marxist communism|Communism]]\n* [[Economic planning]]\n* [[Green socialism]]\n* [[Law of value]]\n* [[Marxism]]\n* [[Marxian economics]]\n* [[Mode of production]]\n* [[Post-capitalism]]\n* [[Primary stage of socialism]]\n* [[Production for use]]\n* [[Relations of production]]\n* [[Scientific socialism]]\n* [[Socialist calculation debate]]\n* [[Socialist economics]]\n* [[Socialization (economics)|Socialisation]]\n* [[Yellow socialism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30m}}\n\n[[Category:Economic ideologies]]\n[[Category:Economic systems]]\n[[Category:Marxism]]\n[[Category:Materialism]]\n[[Category:Modes of production]]\n[[Category:Political ideologies]]\n[[Category:Political movements]]\n[[Category:Socialism|Marxism]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|socialism as a historical evolutionary stage of development in Marxist theory|socialism meaning a method for analyzing socioeconomic development in Marxism|Scientific socialism|broader definitions of socialism|Socialism}}\n{{use British English|date=May 2019}}\n{{Marxism|economics}}\n{{socialism sidebar|variants}}\nThe '''socialist mode of production''', also referred to as the '''lower-stage of communism'''<ref name=\"GothaCritique\">Marx, Karl (1875).

Specifically, this refers to [[Liberty|freedom]] from the [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] imposed upon [[individuals]] in the form of coercive [[social relations]] as well as material [[scarcity]], whereby the individual is compelled to engage in activities merely to survive to reproduce his or herself. The aim of socialism is to provide an environment whereby individuals are free to express their genuine interests, creative freedom and desires unhindered by forms of social control that force individuals to work for a class of owners who expropriate and live off the [[surplus product]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/ch06.htm|title=Marx's Concept Of Socialism|last=Fromm|first=Erich|year=1961|work=Marx's Concept of Man|publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs a set of social relations, socialism is defined by the degree to which economic activity in society is planned by the [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|associated producers]] so that the surplus product produced by socialised assets is controlled by a majority of the population through democratic processes. The sale of [[labour power]] would be abolished so that every individual participates in running their institution as stakeholders or members with no one having coercive power over anyone else in a vertical social [[division of labour]] which is to be distinguished from a non-social, technical division of labour which would still exist in socialism.<ref>Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell (1998). \"Definitions of market and socialism\". ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. pp. 58\u201359. \"For an Anti-Stalinist Marxist, socialism is defined by the degree to which the society is planned. Planning here is understood as the conscious regulation of society by the associated producers themselves. Put it differently, the control over the surplus product rests with the majority of the population through a resolutely democratic process. [...] The sale of labour power is abolished and labour necessarily becomes creative. Everyone participates in running their institutions and society as a whole. No one controls anyone else.\"</ref> The incentive structure changes in a socialist society given the change in the social environment so that an individual labourers' work becomes increasingly autonomous and creative, creating a sense of responsibility for his or her institution as a stakeholder.\n\n=== Role of the state ===\nIn Marxist theory, the [[State (polity)|state]] is \"the institution of organised violence which is used by the [[ruling class]] of a country to maintain the conditions of its rule. Thus, it is only in a society which is divided between hostile social classes that the state exists\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/t.htm#state|title=State|work=Glossary of Terms|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref> The state is seen as a mechanism dominated by the interests of the ruling class. It subjugates other classes, to protect and legitimize the existing [[economic system]].\n\nAfter a [[proletarian revolution]], the state would initially become the instrument of the [[proletariat]]. Conquest of the state by the proletariat is a prerequisite to establishing a socialist system. As socialism is built, the role and scope of the state changes. Class distinctions, based on ownership of the means of production, gradually deteriorate. The concentration of means of production increasingly falls into state hands. Once all means of production become state property, the primary function of the state changes. Political rule via coercion over men diminishes through the creation and enforcement of laws, scientific administration and the direction of the processes of production. As a result, the state becomes an entity of economic coordination rather than a mechanism of class or political control and is no longer a state in the Marxian sense.<ref>Engels, Friedrich (1880).

Marxists Internet Archive. \"In 1816, he declares that politics is the science of production, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics. The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis of political institutions appears here only in embryo. Yet what is here already very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion of political rule over men into an administration of things and a direction of processes of production.\"</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|Capitalist mode of production]]\n* [[Communism#Marxist communism|Communism]]\n* [[Economic planning]]\n* [[Green socialism]]\n* [[Law of value]]\n* [[Marxism]]\n* [[Marxian economics]]\n* [[Mode of production]]\n* [[Post-capitalism]]\n* [[Primary stage of socialism]]\n* [[Production for use]]\n* [[Relations of production]]\n* [[Scientific socialism]]\n* [[Socialist calculation debate]]\n* [[Socialist economics]]\n* [[Socialization (economics)|Socialisation]]\n* [[Yellow socialism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30m}}\n\n[[Category:Economic ideologies]]\n[[Category:Economic systems]]\n[[Category:Marxism]]\n[[Category:Materialism]]\n[[Category:Modes of production]]\n[[Category:Political ideologies]]\n[[Category:Political movements]]\n[[Category:Socialism|Marxism]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: postumous \u2192 posthumous", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_mode_of_production"}
