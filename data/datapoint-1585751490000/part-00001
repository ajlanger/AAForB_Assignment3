The need for expansion arose as several nearby settlements such as [[Sriperumbudur]], [[Kelambakkam]], [[Tiruvallur]] and [[Maraimalai Nagar]] had been undergoing rapid development and had to be incorporated under the CMDA planning strategy. Also, the planning bodies of other metropolises in India such as [[Bengaluru]], [[New Delhi]] and [[Hyderabad]] had already redefined their respective metropolitan regions to include much larger areas and corresponding regional planning was being done. The CMA, however, has not been altered since it was first defined in 1974.

The need for expansion arose as several nearby settlements such as [[Sriperumbudur]], [[Kelambakkam]], [[Tiruvallur]] and [[Maraimalai Nagar]] had been undergoing rapid development and had to be incorporated under the CMDA planning strategy.
