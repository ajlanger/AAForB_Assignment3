Roborovski hamsters remain underground in winter and survive in that season by stockpiling some food in warmer weather and storing it in special food chambers within their burrow system.\n\nThe Roborovski hamster mainly feeds on [[seed]]s. In [[Tuva]] it primarily lives on the seed of the [[alyssum|sand alyssum]], [[Nitraria|Nitre Bush]], [[Caragana arborescens|Siberian peashrub]], ''[[Dracocephalum peregrinum]]'', and [[Astragalus|milkvetch]] as well as [[Carex|sedges]] during the summer-months.

In [[Tuva]] it primarily lives on the seed of the [[alyssum|sand alyssum]], [[Nitraria|Nitre Bush]], [[Caragana arborescens|Siberian peashrub]], ''[[Dracocephalum peregrinum]]'', and [[Astragalus|milkvetch]] as well as [[Carex|sedges]] during the summer-months.

Black and blue are two recessive genes still being investigated. These genes came to the UK in 2017 via Doric Hamstery and the first UK litter of blacks were born there Spring 2018. Both are thought to be self colours behaving like melanistic and it's further dilution to blue that is already found in other species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dorichamstery.wordpress.com/2018/08/14/new-genes-the-black-roborovski/|title=New Genes: The Black Roborovski|last=DoricHM|date=2018-08-14|website=Doric Hamstery|language=en|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\nBreeding in captivity has also produced a darker variation of the naturally sandy-coloured agouti fur.  According to Fox (2006) white faced and derived breeds are considered [[qualzucht|torture-breeding]] and therefore breeding them is forbidden by law in several European countries like Germany or Austria. The [[Zygosity#Homozygous|homozygous]] carrier of the gene variant causes neurological symptoms similar to the [[Myxobolus cerebralis|whirling disease]], where the animal spins itself around until it dies of exhaustion.<ref name=\"Fox2006\">{{ cite book | author=Judy Fox| title=Mein Zwerghamster zu Hause| edition=4th| publisher=Bede-Verlag| location=Ruhmannsfelden | year=2006| isbn=978-3-89860-121-4| language=german | pages =64 }} p.&nbsp;11, p.&nbsp;50</ref><ref name=\"R1994\">{{ cite book| author=Patricia D.

Males usually have a visible scent gland near the navel above the two openings, appearing as a yellow stain in older animals. \n\nThe breeding season for the Roborovski hamster is between April and September.
