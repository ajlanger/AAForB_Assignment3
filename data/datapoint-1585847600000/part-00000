Italian [[coastal battery|coastal batteries]] returned fire and seriously damaged ''Albatros'', while the only reaction from the [[Regia Marina]], owing to the paucity of naval forces available in the area (all the Italian battlefleet was in [[Taranto]] at the time), was limited to a daring but ineffectual counterattack by the [[torpedo boat]] ''Calatafimi''. The French naval bombardment, however, did not cause much damage or casualties; three civilians were killed and twelve were wounded. All damage was repaired within ten days.<ref>Giuseppe Fioravanzo, ''La Marina italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale.

The [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}, [[battleship]] {{HMS|Malaya}} and [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|6}}, along with the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} (whose aircraft launched diversionary attacks on [[La Spezia]] and [[Livorno]]), sailed from Gibraltar and shelled the city in the early morning, firing altogether 273 15-inch shells, 782 6-inch shells and 400 4,5-inch shells. Only one third of the shells fired hit the targets; industrial plants did nut suffer heavy damage, and the only two warships undergoing work in the shipyards, the battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Caio Duilio||2}} and the destroyer {{ship|Italian destroyer|Bersagliere|1938|2}}, remained unscathed. Of 55 merchant ships in the harbour, two were sunk (steamer ''Ezilda Croce'' and floating [[orphanage]] ''Garaventa''), two were seriously damaged (steamers ''Salpi'' and ''Garibaldi'') and twenty-nine suffered splinter damage. The city instead suffered serious damage, with the destruction of 250 buildings, 144 dead and 272 wounded among the civilian population, and 2,500 people left homeless. Reaction by the coastal batteries was ineffectual, while the Italian battlefleet sortied from La Spezia to intercept Force H, but was unable to do so owing to poor cooperation between the Navy and the [[Regia Aeronautica|Air Force]] reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Giuseppe Fioravanzo, ''La Marina italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale.

Thirty-nine civilians were killed.

Damage to the port facilities, instead, were not heavy and were repaired in a short time. Civilian casualties (451 deaths) were relatively light when compared to the extent of the damage; this was largely due to the greater availability (both in number and capacity) of air raid shelters in Genoa, many of which were located in tunnels and underground passages, without buildings that could collapse and bury them (one of the main causes of death in air raids). Bomber Command losses amounted to nine bombers, two of which had collided in mid air.<ref>Marco Gioannini, Giulio Massobrio, ''Bombardate l'Italia.

The old city centre was hit the hardest, especially the area surrounding Piazza De Ferrari (again used as \"aiming point\": 63 of the 72 bombers dropped their load within three miles), Piazza Corvetto and the Carignano district, as well as the [[Teatro Carlo Felice]], the basilica of San Siro and the churches of the Consolazione and of Santo Stefano. This attack was part of a series of raids on Italian cities launched by the Allies after [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|25 July 1943]] and targeting the public opinion in Italy, with the aim of pushing the [[Badoglio I Cabinet|Badoglio government]] to surrender; along with the bombs, thousands of [[airborne leaflet propaganda|propaganda leaflets]] were also dropped, carrying the message: \"''The government in Rome says: the war goes on. This is why our bombing goes on\"''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140202213215/http://rcslibri.corriere.it/bombardatelitalia/bombardate1943.pdf Bombardate l\u2019Italia: 1943]</ref><ref>[https://www.arenzanotracieloemare.it/LIBRO_LASTORIASIAMONOI/LaStoria-3.pdf Arenzano tra cielo e mare]</ref><ref>[http://www.vigilfuoco.it/sitiComandi/GestioneSiti/downloadFile.asp?s=542&f=80596 Vigili del Fuoco]</ref>\n\n===21 October 1943===\n\nFirst raid on Genoa, now occupied by the [[Wehrmacht|Germans]], by the [[United States Army Air Force]]; the raid was carried out by 153 bombers of the [[Twelfth Air Force]].

Italian [[coastal battery|coastal batteries]] returned fire and seriously damaged ''Albatros'', while the only reaction from the [[Regia Marina]], owing to the paucity of naval forces available in the area (all the Italian battlefleet was in [[Taranto]] at the time), was limited to a daring but ineffectual counterattack by the [[torpedo boat]] ''Calatafimi''. The French naval bombardment, however, did not cause much damage or casualties; three civilians were killed and twelve were wounded.

Only one third of the shells fired hit the targets; industrial plants did nut suffer heavy damage, and the only two warships undergoing work in the shipyards, the battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Caio Duilio||2}} and the destroyer {{ship|Italian destroyer|Bersagliere|1938|2}}, remained unscathed. Of 55 merchant ships in the harbour, two were sunk (steamer ''Ezilda Croce'' and floating [[orphanage]] ''Garaventa''), two were seriously damaged (steamers ''Salpi'' and ''Garibaldi'') and twenty-nine suffered splinter damage. The city instead suffered serious damage, with the destruction of 250 buildings, 144 dead and 272 wounded among the civilian population, and 2,500 people left homeless. Reaction by the coastal batteries was ineffectual, while the Italian battlefleet sortied from La Spezia to intercept Force H, but was unable to do so owing to poor cooperation between the Navy and the [[Regia Aeronautica|Air Force]] reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Giuseppe Fioravanzo, ''La Marina italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale.

This attack was part of a series of raids on Italian cities launched by the Allies after [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|25 July 1943]] and targeting the public opinion in Italy, with the aim of pushing the [[Badoglio I Cabinet|Badoglio government]] to surrender; along with the bombs, thousands of [[airborne leaflet propaganda|propaganda leaflets]] were also dropped, carrying the message: \"''The government in Rome says: the war goes on.
