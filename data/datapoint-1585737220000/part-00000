This came right after Trump attended a discussion where his senior health official [[Anthony Fauci]] told him it would actually take \"a year to a year and a half\" (at a minimum, Fauci later said). During that discussion, Trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines, stating: \"I like the sound of a couple of months better\". The length of time required is due to vaccines requiring multiple rounds of tests before being approved for the public's use.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=Trump's baffling coronavirus vaccine event |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/03/trumps-baffling-coronavirus-vaccine-event/ |accessdate=March 24, 2020 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, Trump wrongly blamed the [[Barack Obama administration]] for making \"a decision\" that delayed [[COVID-19 testing]] by the Trump administration.

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\". However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area. The Trump administration continued to require laboratories to apply to the FDA for approval, but allowed the laboratories to test while the FDA processed the applications.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Greenberg |first1=Jon |title=False: Donald Trump stated on March 4, 2020 in a meeting at the White House: \"The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing\" on the coronavirus. |url=https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/06/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-blames-obama-limits-coronavirus-test/ |accessdate=March 24, 2020 |work=[[Politifact]] |date=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, Trump over-promised on the availability of COVID-19 testing in the United States, claiming that: \"Anybody that wants a test can get a test.\" Firstly, there were criteria needed to qualify for a test; recommendations were needed from doctors or health officials to approve testing.

This came right after Trump attended a discussion where his senior health official [[Anthony Fauci]] told him it would actually take \"a year to a year and a half\" (at a minimum, Fauci later said). During that discussion, Trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines, stating: \"I like the sound of a couple of months better\". The length of time required is due to vaccines requiring multiple rounds of tests before being approved for the public's use.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=Trump's baffling coronavirus vaccine event |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/03/trumps-baffling-coronavirus-vaccine-event/ |accessdate=March 24, 2020 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, Trump wrongly blamed the [[Barack Obama administration]] for making \"a decision\" that delayed [[COVID-19 testing]] by the Trump administration.

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\". However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area. The Trump administration continued to require laboratories to apply to the FDA for approval, but allowed the laboratories to test while the FDA processed the applications.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Greenberg |first1=Jon |title=False: Donald Trump stated on March 4, 2020 in a meeting at the White House: \"The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing\" on the coronavirus. |url=https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/06/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-blames-obama-limits-coronavirus-test/ |accessdate=March 24, 2020 |work=[[Politifact]] |date=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, Trump over-promised on the availability of COVID-19 testing in the United States, claiming that: \"Anybody that wants a test can get a test.\" Firstly, there were criteria needed to qualify for a test; recommendations were needed from doctors or health officials to approve testing.
