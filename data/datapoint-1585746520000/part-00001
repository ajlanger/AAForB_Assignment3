{"title_page": "List of statements independent of ZFC", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThe [[mathematics|mathematical]] statements discussed below are {{not a typo|provably}} [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of [[ZFC]] (the canonical [[axiomatic set theory]] of contemporary mathematics, consisting of the [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms]] plus the [[axiom of choice]]), assuming that ZFC is [[consistent]]. A statement is independent of ZFC (sometimes phrased \"undecidable in ZFC\") if it can neither be proven nor disproven from the axioms of ZFC.\n\n==[[Axiomatic set theory]]==\nIn 1931, [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] proved the first ZFC independence result, namely that the consistency of ZFC itself was independent of ZFC ([[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem|G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem]]).\n\nThe following statements are independent of ZFC, among others:\n\n* the consistency of ZFC;\n* the [[continuum hypothesis]] or CH (G\u00f6del produced a model of ZFC in which CH is true, showing that CH cannot be disproven in ZFC; [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] later invented the method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] to exhibit a model of ZFC in which CH fails, showing that CH cannot be proven in ZFC. The following four independence results are also due to G\u00f6del/Cohen.);\n* the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH); \n* a related independent statement is that if a set ''x'' has fewer elements than ''y'', then ''x'' also has fewer [[subset]]s than ''y''. In particular, this statement fails when the cardinalities of the power sets of ''x'' and ''y'' coincide;\n* the [[axiom of constructibility]] (''V'' = ''L''); \n* the [[diamond principle]] (\u25ca);\n* [[Martin's axiom]] (MA);\n* MA + \u00acCH (independence shown by [[Robert Solovay|Solovay]] and [[Stanley Tennenbaum|Tennenbaum]])<ref>{{cite book| last=Kunen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= Kenneth Kunen|title=[[Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs]]|publisher=Elsevier|year=1980|isbn=0-444-86839-9}}</ref>.\n\n[[File:Implication Chains of Undecidable ZFC Statements.png|thumbnail|Diagram showing the implication chains]]\n\nWe have the following chains of implications:\n:''V'' = ''L'' \u2192 \u25ca \u2192 CH,\n:''V'' = ''L'' \u2192 GCH \u2192 CH,\n:CH \u2192 MA,\nand (see section on order theory):\n:\u25ca \u2192 \u00ac[[Suslin hypothesis|SH]],\n:MA + \u00acCH \u2192 [[Aronszajn tree|EATS]] \u2192 SH.\n\nSeveral statements related to the existence of [[large cardinal]]s cannot be proven in ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent). These are independent of ZFC provided that they are consistent with ZFC, which most working set theorists believe to be the case. These statements are strong enough to imply the consistency of ZFC. This has the consequence (via [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem|G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem]]) that their consistency with ZFC cannot be proven in ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent). The following statements belong to this class:\n* Existence of [[inaccessible cardinal]]s\n* Existence of [[Mahlo cardinal]]s\n* Existence of [[measurable cardinal]]s (first conjectured by [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam]])\n* Existence of [[supercompact cardinal]]s\n\nThe following statements can be proven to be independent of ZFC assuming the consistency of a suitable large cardinal:\n* [[Proper forcing axiom]]\n* [[Open coloring axiom]]\n* [[Martin's maximum]]\n* Existence of [[zero sharp|0<sup>#</sup>]]\n* [[Singular cardinals hypothesis]]\n* [[Projective determinacy]] (and even the full [[axiom of determinacy]] if the [[axiom of choice]] is not assumed)\n\n==[[Set theory of the real line]]==\nThere are many [[cardinal invariant]]s of the real line, connected with [[measure theory]] and statements related to the [[Baire category theorem]], whose exact values are independent of ZFC. While nontrivial relations can be proved between them, most cardinal invariants can be any [[regular cardinal]] between [[Aleph number#Aleph-one|\u2135<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Cardinality of the continuum|2<sup>\u2135<sub>0</sub></sup>]]. This is a major area of study in the set theory of the real line (see [[Cichon diagram]]). MA has a tendency to set most interesting cardinal invariants equal to 2<sup>\u2135<sub>0</sub></sup>.\n\nA subset ''X'' of the real line is a [[strong measure zero set]] if to every sequence (''\u03b5<sub>n</sub>'') of positive reals there exists a sequence of intervals (''I<sub>n</sub>'') which covers ''X'' and such that ''I<sub>n</sub>'' has length at most ''\u03b5<sub>n</sub>''.

On the one hand, CH implies that there exists a function on the unit square whose iterated integrals are not equal \u2014 the function is simply the [[indicator function]] of an ordering of [0, 1] equivalent to a [[well ordering]] of the cardinal \u03c9<sub>1</sub>. A similar example can be constructed using [[Martin's axiom|MA]]. On the other hand, the consistency of the strong Fubini theorem was first shown by [[Harvey Friedman|Friedman]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Harvey |last=Friedman |year=1980 |title=A Consistent Fubini-Tonelli Theorem for Nonmeasurable Functions |journal=Illinois J.
