There was economic and political disorganization in the country, the radicalization of the masses, the devaluation of life and polarization of society that intensified during the First World War, leading to the emergence of mob justice, banditry, and riots. Increasingly, a violent solution to political and social problems were emphasized. Ratkovsky notes that the use of coercion was inherent to all parties to the conflict. <ref>[http://www.pseudology.org/Abel/PetroVchk1918_RedTerror.pdf \u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0412\u0427\u041a \u0432 1918 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u0421\u041f\u0431.: \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 2006.] p.236</ref>\n\nRatkovsky places emphasis on the role of foreign countries in intensifying the civil war, involving German, Czechoslovakian, American, British, French, and Japanese forces. The use of repression was justified by the State on the basis of the foreignness of its enemies. There was the suppression of revolutions in Hungary, Germany, and especially Finland, which pushed for more decisive action by the Soviet state against its adversaries. Believing that its foes were diametrically opposed to it, the Soviet forces aimed at suppressing them, including their social basis. Thus, the repression was directed against ancien regime officials and military officers, policemen, and members of the upper classes <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nIn addition to clearing the old state apparatus, the Red Terror had a purpose in strengthening the Soviet state. According to Ratkovsky, the situation demanded the Bolsheviks retain power not only by suppressing rebellion, but also to prevent it at all costs, as well as signs of anarchy. The Red Terror sought to fix the problem of the spontaneous, individual terror. <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nThe Red Terror in [[Soviet Russia]] was justified in the [[Soviet historiography]] as a wartime campaign against [[counter-revolutionaries]] during the Russian Civil War of 1918\u20131921, targeting those who sided with the Whites ([[White Army]]). Bolsheviks referred to any anti-Bolshevik factions as Whites, regardless of whether those factions actually supported the [[White movement]] cause. Leon Trotsky described the context in 1920:\n\n{{Quote|The severity of the proletarian dictatorship in Russia, let us point out here, was conditioned by no less difficult circumstances [than the [[French Revolution]]]. There was one continuous front, on the north and south, in the east and west. Besides the Russian [[White movement|White Guard]] armies of [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]], [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and others, there are those attacking Soviet Russia, simultaneously or in turn: Germans, Austrians, Czecho-Slovaks, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Roumanians, French, British, Americans, Japanese, Finns, Esthonians, Lithuanians ... In a country throttled by a blockade and strangled by hunger, there are conspiracies, risings, terrorist acts, and destruction of roads and bridges.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\nHe then went on to contrast the terror with the revolution and provide the Bolshevik's justification for it:\n\n{{Quote|The first conquest of power by the Soviets at the beginning of November 1917 (new style) was actually accomplished with insignificant sacrifices. The Russian bourgeoisie found itself to such a degree estranged from the masses of the people, so internally helpless, so compromised by the course and the result of the war, so demoralized by the regime of [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]], that it scarcely dared show any resistance. ... A revolutionary class which has conquered power with arms in its hands is bound to, and will, suppress, rifle in hand, all attempts to tear the power out of its hands. Where it has against it a hostile army, it will oppose to it its own army. Where it is confronted with armed conspiracy, attempt at murder, or rising, it will hurl at the heads of its enemies an unsparing penalty.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\n[[Martin Latsis]], chief of the Ukrainian [[Cheka]], stated in the newspaper ''Red Terror'':\n\n{{Quote|We are not fighting against single individuals. We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class. Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words.

We must carry along with us 90 million out of the 100 million of Soviet Russia's population. As for the rest, we have nothing to say to them.

In preparing this revolt, the Whites managed to smuggle more than 3000 rifles and machine guns into the city. The leaders of the plot decided to act on the night 9-10 March 1919. The rebels were joined by wealthy peasants from the villages, which suppressed the Committees of the Poor, and committed massacres against rural activists. Eyewitnesses reported atrocities in villages such as Ivanchug, Chagan, Karalat. In response, Soviet forces led by Kirov undertook to suppress this revolt in the villages, and together with the Committees of the Poor restored Soviet power. The revolt in Astrakhan was brought under control by 10 March, and completely defeated by the 12th. More than 184 were sentenced to death, including monarchists, and representatives of the Kadets, Left-Socialist Revolutionaries, repeat offenders, and persons shown to have links with British and American intelligence services.<ref>\u041c.\u0410\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432, \u0412.\u0416\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439.

Futoryansky notes that the commission engaged in exaggerations and instructed witnesses to emphasize negative aspects of the Soviet state and the Cheka. Another skeptical historian, Y. Semyonov, wrote that ''\"As for the material created by the Denikin Commission to Investigate the Crimes of the Bolsheviks, this institution was least interested in the truth.

After the condemned were stripped of their clothing and other belongings, which were shared among the Cheka executioners, they were either machine-gunned in batches or dispatched individually with a revolver. Those killed in prison were usually shot in the back of the neck as they entered the execution cellar, which became littered with corpses and soaked with blood. Victims killed outside the town were moved by truck, bound and gagged, to their place of execution, where they sometimes were made to dig their own graves.{{sfnp|Leggett|1986|p=199}}\n\nAccording to [[Edvard Radzinsky]], \"it became a common practice to take a husband hostage and wait for his wife to come and purchase his life with her body\".{{r|Radzinsky97_1525}} During [[decossackization]], there were massacres, according to historian [[Robert Gellately]], \"on an unheard of scale\".

Pipes has quoted Marx's observation of the class struggles in 19th century France: \"The present generation resembles the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It must not only conquer a new world, it must also ''perish'' in order to make room for the people who are fit for a new world\", but noted that neither [[Karl Marx|Marx]] nor [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] encouraged mass murder.<ref name=\"Pipes\"/><ref>Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/class-struggles-france/ch03.htm  The Class Struggles in France] (1850).</ref> [[Robert Conquest]] was convinced that \"unprecedented terror must seem necessary to ideologically motivated attempts to transform society massively and speedily, against its natural possibilities\".<ref name=\"reflections\">Robert Conquest, ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (2000), {{ISBN|0-393-04818-7}}, p. 101.</ref>\n\n[[Orlando Figes]]' view was that Red Terror was implicit, not so much in Marxism itself, but in the tumultuous violence of the [[Russian Revolution]]. He noted that there were a number of Bolsheviks, led by [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Mikhail Olminsky]], who criticized the actions and warned that thanks to \"Lenin's violent seizure of power and his rejection of democracy&nbsp;... [t]he Bolsheviks [would be] forced to turn increasingly to terror to silence their political critics and subjugate a society they could not control by other means\".{{sfnp|Figes|1998|pp=630, 649}} Figes also asserts that the Red Terror \"erupted from below. It was an integral element of the social revolution from the start. The Bolsheviks encouraged but did not create this mass terror. The main institutions of the Terror were all shaped, at least in part, in response to these pressures from below.\"{{sfnp|Figes|1998|p=525}}\n\nThe German Marxist [[Karl Kautsky]] pleaded with Lenin against using violence as a form of terrorism, because it was indiscriminate, intended to frighten the civilian population, and included the taking and executing hostages. \"Among the phenomena for which Bolshevism has been responsible, terrorism, which begins with the abolition of every form of freedom of the Press, and ends in a system of wholesale execution, is certainly the most striking and the most repellent of all\".<ref>[[Karl Kautsky]], [http://marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/ch08b.htm#s6 ''Terrorism and Communism''] Chapter VIII, The Communists at Work, The Terror</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', [[Nicolas Werth]] contrasts the Red and [[White Terror (Russia)|White terrors]], noting the former was the official policy of the Bolshevik government:\n\n<blockquote>The Bolshevik policy of terror was more systematic, better organized, and targeted at whole social classes. Moreover, it had been thought out and put into practice before the outbreak of the civil war. The White Terror was never systematized in such a fashion. It was almost invariably the work of detachments that were out of control, and taking measures not officially authorized by the military command that was attempting, without much success, to act as a government. If one discounts the pogroms, which [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] himself condemned, the White Terror most often was a series of reprisals by the police acting as a sort of military counterespionage force. The Cheka and the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic were a structured and powerful instrument of repression of a completely different order, which had support at the highest level from the Bolshevik regime.{{sfnp|Werth, Bartosek et al.|1999|p=82}}</blockquote>\n\nYuri Semyonov argues that \"apologists for the Whites, trying to justify them, often say: the White Terror simply amounted to the excesses of individuals wronged by the Bolsheviks, while the Red Terror was a deliberate policy of the Bolsheviks in general and particularly Lenin. This, however, is not true.\" Semyonov cites documents from Siberia stating \"it's forbidden to arrest the workers, you're commanded to shoot or hang them.\" Kolchak himself issued an order to \"I order you to shoot all captured Communists. Now we rely on the bayonet.\" Kolchak's governor for Yenisei region Lieutenant-General S. Rozanov issued an order stating \"The villages, whose people meet  government troops with weapons, burn them down and shoot the adult males without exception. Confiscate property, horses, wagons, and grains in favor of the treasury.\" <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJames Ryan points out that Lenin never advocated for the physical extermination of the entire bourgeoisie as a class, just the execution of those who were actively involved in opposing and undermining Bolshevik rule.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=116}}  He did intend to bring about \"the overthrow and complete abolition of the bourgeoisie\", but through non-violent political and economic means.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=74}}\n\n[[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] noted that while Bolsheviks (especially Lenin) were very much focused on the Marxian concept of \"violent revolution\" and [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] long before the [[October Revolution]]. Implementation of the dictatorship was clearly defined by Lenin as early as in 1906 where he argued it must involve \"unlimited power based on force and not on law\", \"absolutely unrestricted by any rules whatever and based directly on violence\". In ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' of 1917 Lenin once again reiterated the arguments raised by Marx and Engels calling for use of terror. Voices calling for moderate use of violence, such as Kautsky's, met \"furious reply\" from Lenin in ''[[The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky]]'' (1918). Another theoretical and systematic argument in favor of organized terror in response to Kautsky's reservations was written by  [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] in ''[[Terrorism and Communism|The Defense of Terrorism]]'' (1921). Trotsky argued that in the light of historical materialism, it's sufficient that the \"violence is successful\" for it to justify its \"rightness\". Trotsky also introduced and provided ideological justification for many of the future features characterizing the Bolshevik system, such as \"militarization of labor\" and concentration camps.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Main currents of Marxism|last=Ko\u0142akowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W.W.

There was economic and political disorganization in the country, the radicalization of the masses, the devaluation of life and polarization of society that intensified during the First World War, leading to the emergence of mob justice, banditry, and riots. Increasingly, a violent solution to political and social problems were emphasized. Ratkovsky notes that the use of coercion was inherent to all parties to the conflict. <ref>[http://www.pseudology.org/Abel/PetroVchk1918_RedTerror.pdf \u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0412\u0427\u041a \u0432 1918 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u0421\u041f\u0431.: \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 2006.] p.236</ref>\n\nRatkovsky places emphasis on the role of foreign countries in intensifying the civil war, involving German, Czechoslovakian, American, British, French, and Japanese forces. The use of repression was justified by the State on the basis of the foreignness of its enemies. There was the suppression of revolutions in Hungary, Germany, and especially Finland, which pushed for more decisive action by the Soviet state against its adversaries. Believing that its foes were diametrically opposed to it, the Soviet forces aimed at suppressing them, including their social basis. Thus, the repression was directed against ancien regime officials and military officers, policemen, and members of the upper classes <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nIn addition to clearing the old state apparatus, the Red Terror had a purpose in strengthening the Soviet state. According to Ratkovsky, the situation demanded the Bolsheviks retain power not only by suppressing rebellion, but also to prevent it at all costs, as well as signs of anarchy. The Red Terror sought to fix the problem of the spontaneous, individual terror. <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nThe Red Terror in [[Soviet Russia]] was justified in the [[Soviet historiography]] as a wartime campaign against [[counter-revolutionaries]] during the Russian Civil War of 1918\u20131921, targeting those who sided with the Whites ([[White Army]]). Bolsheviks referred to any anti-Bolshevik factions as Whites, regardless of whether those factions actually supported the [[White movement]] cause. Leon Trotsky described the context in 1920:\n\n{{Quote|The severity of the proletarian dictatorship in Russia, let us point out here, was conditioned by no less difficult circumstances [than the [[French Revolution]]]. There was one continuous front, on the north and south, in the east and west.

In a country throttled by a blockade and strangled by hunger, there are conspiracies, risings, terrorist acts, and destruction of roads and bridges.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\nHe then went on to contrast the terror with the revolution and provide the Bolshevik's justification for it:\n\n{{Quote|The first conquest of power by the Soviets at the beginning of November 1917 (new style) was actually accomplished with insignificant sacrifices. The Russian bourgeoisie found itself to such a degree estranged from the masses of the people, so internally helpless, so compromised by the course and the result of the war, so demoralized by the regime of [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]], that it scarcely dared show any resistance. ... A revolutionary class which has conquered power with arms in its hands is bound to, and will, suppress, rifle in hand, all attempts to tear the power out of its hands.

Futoryansky notes that the commission engaged in exaggerations and instructed witnesses to emphasize negative aspects of the Soviet state and the Cheka. Another skeptical historian, Y. Semyonov, wrote that ''\"As for the material created by the Denikin Commission to Investigate the Crimes of the Bolsheviks, this institution was least interested in the truth. Its purpose was anti-Bolshevik propaganda. The White Guard propagandists were so overdone with the exposure of Bolshevik atrocities that when the falsity of much of what they said became clear, western public opinion was inclined not to believe bad things about the Bolsheviks.\"'' <ref name=\":1\">http://scepsis.ru/library/id_423.html</ref>\n\nExecutions took place in prison cellars or courtyards, or occasionally on the outskirts of town, during the Red Terror and [[Russian Civil War]]. After the condemned were stripped of their clothing and other belongings, which were shared among the Cheka executioners, they were either machine-gunned in batches or dispatched individually with a revolver. Those killed in prison were usually shot in the back of the neck as they entered the execution cellar, which became littered with corpses and soaked with blood. Victims killed outside the town were moved by truck, bound and gagged, to their place of execution, where they sometimes were made to dig their own graves.{{sfnp|Leggett|1986|p=199}}\n\nAccording to [[Edvard Radzinsky]], \"it became a common practice to take a husband hostage and wait for his wife to come and purchase his life with her body\".{{r|Radzinsky97_1525}} During [[decossackization]], there were massacres, according to historian [[Robert Gellately]], \"on an unheard of scale\".

Pipes has quoted Marx's observation of the class struggles in 19th century France: \"The present generation resembles the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It must not only conquer a new world, it must also ''perish'' in order to make room for the people who are fit for a new world\", but noted that neither [[Karl Marx|Marx]] nor [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] encouraged mass murder.<ref name=\"Pipes\"/><ref>Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/class-struggles-france/ch03.htm  The Class Struggles in France] (1850).</ref> [[Robert Conquest]] was convinced that \"unprecedented terror must seem necessary to ideologically motivated attempts to transform society massively and speedily, against its natural possibilities\".<ref name=\"reflections\">Robert Conquest, ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (2000), {{ISBN|0-393-04818-7}}, p. 101.</ref>\n\n[[Orlando Figes]]' view was that Red Terror was implicit, not so much in Marxism itself, but in the tumultuous violence of the [[Russian Revolution]]. He noted that there were a number of Bolsheviks, led by [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Mikhail Olminsky]], who criticized the actions and warned that thanks to \"Lenin's violent seizure of power and his rejection of democracy&nbsp;... [t]he Bolsheviks [would be] forced to turn increasingly to terror to silence their political critics and subjugate a society they could not control by other means\".{{sfnp|Figes|1998|pp=630, 649}} Figes also asserts that the Red Terror \"erupted from below. It was an integral element of the social revolution from the start. The Bolsheviks encouraged but did not create this mass terror. The main institutions of the Terror were all shaped, at least in part, in response to these pressures from below.\"{{sfnp|Figes|1998|p=525}}\n\nThe German Marxist [[Karl Kautsky]] pleaded with Lenin against using violence as a form of terrorism, because it was indiscriminate, intended to frighten the civilian population, and included the taking and executing hostages. \"Among the phenomena for which Bolshevism has been responsible, terrorism, which begins with the abolition of every form of freedom of the Press, and ends in a system of wholesale execution, is certainly the most striking and the most repellent of all\".<ref>[[Karl Kautsky]], [http://marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/ch08b.htm#s6 ''Terrorism and Communism''] Chapter VIII, The Communists at Work, The Terror</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', [[Nicolas Werth]] contrasts the Red and [[White Terror (Russia)|White terrors]], noting the former was the official policy of the Bolshevik government:\n\n<blockquote>The Bolshevik policy of terror was more systematic, better organized, and targeted at whole social classes. Moreover, it had been thought out and put into practice before the outbreak of the civil war. The White Terror was never systematized in such a fashion. It was almost invariably the work of detachments that were out of control, and taking measures not officially authorized by the military command that was attempting, without much success, to act as a government. If one discounts the pogroms, which [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] himself condemned, the White Terror most often was a series of reprisals by the police acting as a sort of military counterespionage force. The Cheka and the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic were a structured and powerful instrument of repression of a completely different order, which had support at the highest level from the Bolshevik regime.{{sfnp|Werth, Bartosek et al.|1999|p=82}}</blockquote>\n\nYuri Semyonov argues that \"apologists for the Whites, trying to justify them, often say: the White Terror simply amounted to the excesses of individuals wronged by the Bolsheviks, while the Red Terror was a deliberate policy of the Bolsheviks in general and particularly Lenin. This, however, is not true.\" Semyonov cites documents from Siberia stating \"it's forbidden to arrest the workers, you're commanded to shoot or hang them.\" Kolchak himself issued an order to \"I order you to shoot all captured Communists. Now we rely on the bayonet.\" Kolchak's governor for Yenisei region Lieutenant-General S. Rozanov issued an order stating \"The villages, whose people meet  government troops with weapons, burn them down and shoot the adult males without exception. Confiscate property, horses, wagons, and grains in favor of the treasury.\" <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJames Ryan points out that Lenin never advocated for the physical extermination of the entire bourgeoisie as a class, just the execution of those who were actively involved in opposing and undermining Bolshevik rule.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=116}}  He did intend to bring about \"the overthrow and complete abolition of the bourgeoisie\", but through non-violent political and economic means.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=74}}\n\n[[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] noted that while Bolsheviks (especially Lenin) were very much focused on the Marxian concept of \"violent revolution\" and [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] long before the [[October Revolution]]. Implementation of the dictatorship was clearly defined by Lenin as early as in 1906 where he argued it must involve \"unlimited power based on force and not on law\", \"absolutely unrestricted by any rules whatever and based directly on violence\". In ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' of 1917 Lenin once again reiterated the arguments raised by Marx and Engels calling for use of terror. Voices calling for moderate use of violence, such as Kautsky's, met \"furious reply\" from Lenin in ''[[The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky]]'' (1918). Another theoretical and systematic argument in favor of organized terror in response to Kautsky's reservations was written by  [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] in ''[[Terrorism and Communism|The Defense of Terrorism]]'' (1921). Trotsky argued that in the light of historical materialism, it's sufficient that the \"violence is successful\" for it to justify its \"rightness\". Trotsky also introduced and provided ideological justification for many of the future features characterizing the Bolshevik system, such as \"militarization of labor\" and concentration camps.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Main currents of Marxism|last=Ko\u0142akowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W.W.
