This is in contradistinction to the crowded atmosphere of the more popular [[Dewey Beach, Delaware|Dewey Beach]] and the cosmopolitan bustle of nearby [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware|Rehoboth Beach]]. Assisting South Bethany's reputation as a \"quiet\" place is the presence of [[Delaware Seashore State Park]] \u2013 a six-mile-long [[barrier island]] providing a substantial buffer from Dewey Beach's noise \u2013 to the north of Bethany Beach, as well as that of a large unincorporated area of private condominiums and multimillion-dollar beach homes between the park and Bethany Beach. To the south, South Bethany is insulated from busy [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]], [[Maryland]], by [[Fenwick Island State Park]] and Fenwick Island itself.\n\nUnlike Bethany Beach and Fenwick Island, South Bethany is almost exclusively residential.

While it dragged on, [[William Penn]] granted the [[Delaware Colony]] its own legislature in 1701, establishing it as a separate colony. The dispute over the boundaries of the three colonies was not resolved until 1759, when the parties to the dispute agreed that the area where South Bethany now lies was part of Delaware.\n\nOutside of ''Penn vs. Baltimore'', recorded European interest in the land that was to become South Bethany dates to at least 1687, when an [[English people|Englishman]], Matthew Scarborough, had much of the area of what are now Bethany Beach and South Bethany surveyed, the 500 acres (202 hectares) surveyed in the northern part of the area becoming known as \"Scarborough's Adventure,\" while a 500-acre (202-hectare) parcel to its south became known as \"Middlesex.\" He \"took up\" \u2013 i.e., took possession of \u2013 the two parcels of land in 1688, and they were renamed \"North Petherton\" and \"South Petherton.\" The part of the area that would become South Bethany was included in a 430-acre (174-hectare) portion of South Petherton at the head of [[Little Assawoman Bay]] about two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) south of what is now Bethany Beach granted to Scarborough under a Maryland [[land patent]] in 1695.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, pp. 12-13.</ref>\n\nEnglish settlers established farms in parts of what is now South Bethany. In 1741, Englishman William Evans was granted a land patent under a survey that combined North and South Petherton into a single parcel of land.<ref name=\"Walter13\"/>\n\nIn 1926, George McClellan of [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], bought four adjoining tracts of land in what is now South Bethany covering a combined 140 acres (56.7 hectares). McLellan conveyed the land to the Delaware Shore Land Corporation.<ref name=\"Walter13\"/>\n\n===Founding of South Bethany===\n\nIn 1952, the first span of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] opened, greatly improving access to the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] from [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], Maryland, and [[Washington, D.C.]], and spurring a great deal of growth and new investment in the Bethany Beach area. That year, Richard Hall and Elizabeth \"Iggie\" Hall purchased about 130 acres (52.6 hectares) of marsh land and old farm land from the Delaware Shore Land Corporation. Doing business as the South Bethany Corporation, the Halls sold 50-by-100-foot (15.2-by-30.5-meter) lots to people wishing to build vacation houses on the Delaware coast and named the new community \"South Bethany\" in order to exploit the popularity among vacationers of Bethany Beach, just to the north. The Halls conceived of South Bethany as strictly residential, with no businesses of any kind within its boundaries. For the next 10 years, the South Bethany Corporation  worked to drain and raise marshland to allow additional buildable lots and dug five miles (8&nbsp;km) of [[canal]]s in the community to ensure that people who purchased a lot in South Bethany would have either direct access to the beach along the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 where the community provided no [[lifeguard]] service, its only safety measure being a [[torpedo]]-style [[Personal flotation device|life preserver]] hanging from a post on the beach \u2013 or would reside along a canal offering access to inland bays and rivers by boat. By 1959, when a lot cost $1,050 and required a $200 down payment, they had sold 500 lots in South Bethany.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"We Present To You...South Bethany,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, p. 3.</ref><ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, pp. 13, 16, 18, 21.</ref>\n\nAccess to the community was via [[Delaware Route 14]], known as Coastal Highway, a paved two-lane road with no [[Shoulder (road)|shoulders]]. As the community grew, Route 14 became inadequate for the automobile traffic South Bethany generated, and in 1958 Route 14 was expanded into a four-lane divided highway; it was redesignated as a portion of [[Delaware Route 1]] in the 1970s.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, p. 24.</ref> At the time, the [[Delaware Army National Guard]] would drive its tracked [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|self-propelled anti-aircraft guns]] from its barracks north of Bethany Beach down Coastal Highway through Bethany Beach and South Bethany to its training grounds just south of South Bethany, where it would engage in [[antiaircraft]] training, firing at [[target drone]]s flying over the Atlantic.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015; pp. 25-26.</ref>\n\n===Incorporation and expansion===\n====1960s through 1990s====\nAlthough Iggie Hall of the South Bethany Corporation tried to have South Bethany [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a town even in its early years in order to improve services in the community, she had no success.

Delaware's Atlantic coast experienced severe damage from very high tides and waves more than 40 feet (12 meters) high breaking on its beaches. In South Bethany, the storm destroyed 37 oceanfront homes.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015; p. 29.</ref> The 1962 storm gave a new impetus to incorporation, because as an unincorporated community South Bethany could not receive federal funding to recover from the disaster. The [[Delaware General Assembly]] rebuffed the initial efforts to incorporate the community after the storm, claiming that its tiny year-round population disqualified it from incorporation.<ref name=\"Walter34\"/> The assembly eventually did pass an incorporation bill, which the [[governor of Delaware]], [[Charles L. Terry, Jr.]], signed in December 1965.<ref name=\"townhistory\"/> In the first public referendum in South Bethany on incorporation, held in June 1966, voters decisively rejected it.<ref name=\"Walter34\"/><ref name=\"townhistory\"/> But in 1969 another referendum on the matter won, and on June 18, 1969, Governor [[Russell W.

While it dragged on, [[William Penn]] granted the [[Delaware Colony]] its own legislature in 1701, establishing it as a separate colony. The dispute over the boundaries of the three colonies was not resolved until 1759, when the parties to the dispute agreed that the area where South Bethany now lies was part of Delaware.\n\nOutside of ''Penn vs. Baltimore'', recorded European interest in the land that was to become South Bethany dates to at least 1687, when an [[English people|Englishman]], Matthew Scarborough, had much of the area of what are now Bethany Beach and South Bethany surveyed, the 500 acres (202 hectares) surveyed in the northern part of the area becoming known as \"Scarborough's Adventure,\" while a 500-acre (202-hectare) parcel to its south became known as \"Middlesex.\" He \"took up\" \u2013 i.e., took possession of \u2013 the two parcels of land in 1688, and they were renamed \"North Petherton\" and \"South Petherton.\" The part of the area that would become South Bethany was included in a 430-acre (174-hectare) portion of South Petherton at the head of [[Little Assawoman Bay]] about two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) south of what is now Bethany Beach granted to Scarborough under a Maryland [[land patent]] in 1695.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, pp. 12-13.</ref>\n\nEnglish settlers established farms in parts of what is now South Bethany. In 1741, Englishman William Evans was granted a land patent under a survey that combined North and South Petherton into a single parcel of land.<ref name=\"Walter13\"/>\n\nIn 1926, George McClellan of [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], bought four adjoining tracts of land in what is now South Bethany covering a combined 140 acres (56.7 hectares). McLellan conveyed the land to the Delaware Shore Land Corporation.<ref name=\"Walter13\"/>\n\n===Founding of South Bethany===\n\nIn 1952, the first span of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] opened, greatly improving access to the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] from [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], Maryland, and [[Washington, D.C.]], and spurring a great deal of growth and new investment in the Bethany Beach area. That year, Richard Hall and Elizabeth \"Iggie\" Hall purchased about 130 acres (52.6 hectares) of marsh land and old farm land from the Delaware Shore Land Corporation. Doing business as the South Bethany Corporation, the Halls sold 50-by-100-foot (15.2-by-30.5-meter) lots to people wishing to build vacation houses on the Delaware coast and named the new community \"South Bethany\" in order to exploit the popularity among vacationers of Bethany Beach, just to the north. The Halls conceived of South Bethany as strictly residential, with no businesses of any kind within its boundaries. For the next 10 years, the South Bethany Corporation  worked to drain and raise marshland to allow additional buildable lots and dug five miles (8&nbsp;km) of [[canal]]s in the community to ensure that people who purchased a lot in South Bethany would have either direct access to the beach along the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 where the community provided no [[lifeguard]] service, its only safety measure being a [[torpedo]]-style [[Personal flotation device|life preserver]] hanging from a post on the beach \u2013 or would reside along a canal offering access to inland bays and rivers by boat. By 1959, when a lot cost $1,050 and required a $200 down payment, they had sold 500 lots in South Bethany.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"We Present To You...South Bethany,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, p. 3.</ref><ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, pp. 13, 16, 18, 21.</ref>\n\nAccess to the community was via [[Delaware Route 14]], known as Coastal Highway, a paved two-lane road with no [[Shoulder (road)|shoulders]]. As the community grew, Route 14 became inadequate for the automobile traffic South Bethany generated, and in 1958 Route 14 was expanded into a four-lane divided highway; it was redesignated as a portion of [[Delaware Route 1]] in the 1970s.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, p. 24.</ref> At the time, the [[Delaware Army National Guard]] would drive its tracked [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|self-propelled anti-aircraft guns]] from its barracks north of Bethany Beach down Coastal Highway through Bethany Beach and South Bethany to its training grounds just south of South Bethany, where it would engage in [[antiaircraft]] training, firing at [[target drone]]s flying over the Atlantic.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015; pp. 25-26.</ref>\n\n===Incorporation and expansion===\n====1960s through 1990s====\nAlthough Iggie Hall of the South Bethany Corporation tried to have South Bethany [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a town even in its early years in order to improve services in the community, she had no success. Meanwhile, a group of South Bethany residents formed the South Bethany Association to address community services and needs.<ref name=\"Walter34\">Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, p. 22.</ref>\n\nA destructive [[nor'easter]] known as the [[Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962]] struck the area from March 6 to 8, 1962. Delaware's Atlantic coast experienced severe damage from very high tides and waves more than 40 feet (12 meters) high breaking on its beaches. In South Bethany, the storm destroyed 37 oceanfront homes.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015; p. 29.</ref> The 1962 storm gave a new impetus to incorporation, because as an unincorporated community South Bethany could not receive federal funding to recover from the disaster. The [[Delaware General Assembly]] rebuffed the initial efforts to incorporate the community after the storm, claiming that its tiny year-round population disqualified it from incorporation.<ref name=\"Walter34\"/> The assembly eventually did pass an incorporation bill, which the [[governor of Delaware]], [[Charles L.
