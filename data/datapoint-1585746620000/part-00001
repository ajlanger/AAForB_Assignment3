It has a [[masthead sloop]] rig with [[anodized]] [[aluminum]] spars and steel rod [[standing rigging]] for the three spreader mast. The design has a [[raked stem]], a [[reverse transom]], a spade-type [[rudder]] controlled by a [[Ship's wheel|wheel]] and a fixed fin [[keel]].

The fuel tank holds {{convert|33|u.s.gal}} and the fresh water tank has a capacity of {{convert|50|u.s.gal}}.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe cruising interior configuration provides sleeping accommodation for four people. There is an aft cabin under the cockpit with a king-sized berth and a bow cabin, with a \"V\"-berth. The [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] is located on the starboard side at the foot of the [[companionway]] steps. It features a [[gimballed]] [[propane]]-fired stove and a [[stainless steel]] icebox and sink, with foot-pumped fresh water and sea water. The [[Head (watercraft)|head]] is located amidships, opposite the galley, on the port side and includes a shower. It is accessible from the aft cabin and the saloon. A second head forward was a factory option. The saloon has two curved settees and a table with the keel-stepped mast passing through it. A navigation station is on the port side forward of the head.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nFor sailing there are winches for the mainsail, [[genoa (sail)|genoa]] and [[spinnaker]] internally-mounted [[halyard]]s, as well as for the [[mainsheet]].
