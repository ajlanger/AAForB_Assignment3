''Kiss of Death'' was planned as a three-issue limited series<ref name=TCJ116 /> but only published two issues. (It was completed in ''Last Kiss'', co-published with [[Eclipse Comics]] in 1988.)\n\nThat year the company also published its first translation: ''[[Kogaratsu]]'',<ref>Dutry, Jacques. \"International Newswatch: The French Comics Scene Part Two,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #120 (Mar. 1988), p. 20.</ref> a popular [[Franco-Belgian comic|Franco-Belgian]] [[samurai]] title by Bosse (Serge Bosmans) and Michetz (Marc Degroide).\n\nAnother title published by Acme was 1989's ''Lea: The Confessions of Julius Antoine'' by [[Serge Le Tendre]] and Christian Rossi, an English translation of a French comics album; the book was distributed in the U.S. by [[Fantagraphics Books]]. ''Lea'' won the 1990 [[UK Comic Art Award]] for Best Translated Graphic Novel.<ref>MCH. \"Newswatch: Arkham Leads British Awards,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #137 (Sept. 1990), p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe Acme founders split editorial duties on the various titles, French translations were by Hansom, and many books were lettered by Bambos. \n\nAt some point during this period the company produced and sold a few select comics-related videotapes, including ''Alan Moore at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|I.C.A.]]'', ''10 Years of [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'', and ''[[Will Eisner]]: A Life of Sequential Art''.<ref name=WhosWhoAcme />\n\n=== Retail location ===\nAcme opened a retail location, '''Acme Comics''', in 1987 on [[Coldharbour Lane]] in [[Brixton]],<ref name=TCJ131>Brooks, Brad! \"International Spotlight: Frank Bellamy: ''Dan Dare'' Artist Exhibited at South London Gallery,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #131 (Sept. 1989), pp. 13\u201314.</ref><ref name=Curson072910 /> [[South London]].

Highlights from that era included ''[[Powerman (comics)|Power Comics]]'', a four-issue superhero title by writers Don Avenall and [[Norman Worker]], with art by [[Dave Gibbons]] and [[Brian Bolland]]. The title was originally published in [[Nigeria]] in 1975, and the title's character's names was changed from \"Powerman\" to \"Powerbolt\" to avoid confusion with the character [[Luke Cage]] (also called \"Power Man\"), published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Another notable title from the Acme/Eclipse era was ''Aces'', a five-issue black-and-white anthology of serialized [[Jazz Age]] genre stories which were originally published in Europe. Among its features were \"Hollywood Eye,\" by Francois Rivi\u00e8re, [[Jean-Louis Bouquet]], and Philippe Berthet; \"Air Mail\" by Attilio Micheluzi; and \"Morgan\" by [[Antonio Segura]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Ortiz (comics)|Jos\u00e9 Ortiz]].\n\nIn 1989 Acme struck up a relationship with [[John Brown Publishing]], co-publishing with JBP the two-issue anthology ''Point Blank'', which promoted itself as \"The Best of European Strip Art\". Creators included Ruben Pellejero & [[Jorge Zentner]], and [[Giancarlo Berardi]] & [[Ivo Milazzo]]. This title was also distributed in the U.S. via Eclipse. Acme also sold ''Speakeasy'' to JPB in 1989.<ref>\"Newswatch: ''Speakeasy'' Goes Out with a ''Blast!'',\" ''The Comics Journal'' #140 (Feb. 1991), p. 21.</ref><ref>Curson, Natasha.

The series featured the three-part story, \"The Golden Game,\" in issues #1\u20133, by [[Grant Morrison]]; and a two-part story, \"A Deadly Rainbow,\" in issues #2\u20133, by Anne Caulfield; both had art by [[Ian Gibson (comics)|Ian Gibson]].\n\nIn 1990 Acme teamed with Eclipse to release [[Eddie Campbell]]'s ''The Complete Alec'',<ref>Yang, Sam. \"A Loaf of Bread, A Jug of Wine and Eddie Campbell,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #145 (Oct. 1991), p. 59.</ref> which collected three previous \"Alec\" publications \u2014 ''Alec'' (1984), ''Love and Beerglasses'' (1985), and ''Doggie in the Window'' (1986) \u2014 together with some unpublished material.

Written by Gary Pleece and illustrated by [[Warren Pleece]], it was the \"first U.S. issue\" of what had previously been the brother's self-publishing venture from 1987 to 1989. A satirical collection of stories, there were no recurring characters, but many recognizable caricatures from politics and pop culture.\n\nAcme reorganized in 1991, changing its name from Acme Press to '''Acme Comics'''.\n\n=== Dark Horse/Acme ===\nAcme's relationship with Eclipse ended in 1992 (Eclipse would go defunct a year later), and Acme struck up a new arrangement with another up-and-coming American black-and-white publisher, [[Dark Horse Comics]]. With Dark Horse, Acme acted more as a [[Book packager|packager]] rather than a co-publisher. (The Acme logo was styled to look like a Dark Horse imprint.) The comics the two companies produced were strictly James Bond titles (edited by Hansom) and the nine-issue series ''Lux & Alby Sign on and Save the Universe'', by [[Martin Millar]] and [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]]. (Another James Bond story, \"Operation Miasma\" by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Russ Heath]], appeared in the ''Dark Horse Comics'' anthology, issue #25, published Sept. 1994.) Co-founder Dick Hansom, though not technically working for Acme at the time, edited [[Bryan Talbot]]'s ''[[The Tale of One Bad Rat]]'', published by Dark Horse in 1994\u20131995.<ref name=WhosWhoHansom />\n\nAcme's partnership with Dark Horse lasted until 1995.\n\n=== Closure and further careers of the founders ===\nAcme went defunct in 1995. Co-founders Ashford, Ridout, and Bambos all found work in the mainstream comics industry for a time.\n\nBambos left Acme in 1988, moving on to [[Dave Elliott (comics)|Dave Elliott]] and [[Garry Leach]]'s [[Atomeka Press]], where he worked until 1990. In the early 1990s, he found some work as a cover inker for [[Marvel Comics]].<ref name=WhosWhoBambos>[http://bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=GEORGIOU%2C+BAMBOS Bambos entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928\u20131999''.

He worked freelance as an assistant editor at Marvel from 1991 to 1994, while performing the same duties at DC Comics.<ref name=WhosWhoAshford>[http://bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=ASHFORD%2C+DICK Ashford entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928\u20131999''.

He wrote a two-part [[Scarlet Witch]] story in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' in 1993, and worked as an editor for [[Marvel UK]] (on the ''[[Doctor Who (comics)|Doctor Who: Classic Comics]]'' series) in 1994.

The fourth volume of ''Maxwell the Magic Cat'' contained a gallery of Maxwell illustrations by the likes of [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], [[David Lloyd (comics)|David Lloyd]], [[Gilbert Shelton]], [[John Ridgway (comics)|John Ridgway]], [[Graham Higgins]], [[Phil Elliott]], [[Rian Hughes]], and [[Brian Bolland]].\n\nIn March 1987 Acme also debuted ''Kiss of Death'',<ref name=TCJ116>\"Newswatch World: British Black-and-Whites After Market Collapse,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #116 (July 1987), p. 131.</ref> a [[horror comics]] anthology featuring the artwork of [[John Watkiss]]. ''Kiss of Death'' was planned as a three-issue limited series<ref name=TCJ116 /> but only published two issues. (It was completed in ''Last Kiss'', co-published with [[Eclipse Comics]] in 1988.)\n\nThat year the company also published its first translation: ''[[Kogaratsu]]'',<ref>Dutry, Jacques. \"International Newswatch: The French Comics Scene Part Two,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #120 (Mar. 1988), p. 20.</ref> a popular [[Franco-Belgian comic|Franco-Belgian]] [[samurai]] title by Bosse (Serge Bosmans) and Michetz (Marc Degroide).\n\nAnother title published by Acme was 1989's ''Lea: The Confessions of Julius Antoine'' by [[Serge Le Tendre]] and Christian Rossi, an English translation of a French comics album; the book was distributed in the U.S. by [[Fantagraphics Books]]. ''Lea'' won the 1990 [[UK Comic Art Award]] for Best Translated Graphic Novel.<ref>MCH. \"Newswatch: Arkham Leads British Awards,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #137 (Sept. 1990), p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe Acme founders split editorial duties on the various titles, French translations were by Hansom, and many books were lettered by Bambos. \n\nAt some point during this period the company produced and sold a few select comics-related videotapes, including ''Alan Moore at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|I.C.A.]]'', ''10 Years of [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'', and ''[[Will Eisner]]: A Life of Sequential Art''.<ref name=WhosWhoAcme />\n\n=== Retail location ===\nAcme opened a retail location, '''Acme Comics''', in 1987 on [[Coldharbour Lane]] in [[Brixton]],<ref name=TCJ131>Brooks, Brad! \"International Spotlight: Frank Bellamy: ''Dan Dare'' Artist Exhibited at South London Gallery,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #131 (Sept. 1989), pp. 13\u201314.</ref><ref name=Curson072910 /> [[South London]].

Retrieved Feb. 4, 2020.</ref>\n\n=== Acme/Eclipse ===\nIn 1988 the British market for black-and-white comics collapsed.<ref name=TCJ116 /> As a result, Acme partnered with the American independent publisher [[Eclipse Comics]] (\"Eclipse International\") to distribute Acme's comics in the American market. Highlights from that era included ''[[Powerman (comics)|Power Comics]]'', a four-issue superhero title by writers Don Avenall and [[Norman Worker]], with art by [[Dave Gibbons]] and [[Brian Bolland]]. The title was originally published in [[Nigeria]] in 1975, and the title's character's names was changed from \"Powerman\" to \"Powerbolt\" to avoid confusion with the character [[Luke Cage]] (also called \"Power Man\"), published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Another notable title from the Acme/Eclipse era was ''Aces'', a five-issue black-and-white anthology of serialized [[Jazz Age]] genre stories which were originally published in Europe. Among its features were \"Hollywood Eye,\" by Francois Rivi\u00e8re, [[Jean-Louis Bouquet]], and Philippe Berthet; \"Air Mail\" by Attilio Micheluzi; and \"Morgan\" by [[Antonio Segura]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Ortiz (comics)|Jos\u00e9 Ortiz]].\n\nIn 1989 Acme struck up a relationship with [[John Brown Publishing]], co-publishing with JBP the two-issue anthology ''Point Blank'', which promoted itself as \"The Best of European Strip Art\". Creators included Ruben Pellejero & [[Jorge Zentner]], and [[Giancarlo Berardi]] & [[Ivo Milazzo]]. This title was also distributed in the U.S. via Eclipse. Acme also sold ''Speakeasy'' to JPB in 1989.<ref>\"Newswatch: ''Speakeasy'' Goes Out with a ''Blast!'',\" ''The Comics Journal'' #140 (Feb. 1991), p. 21.</ref><ref>Curson, Natasha.

The series featured the three-part story, \"The Golden Game,\" in issues #1\u20133, by [[Grant Morrison]]; and a two-part story, \"A Deadly Rainbow,\" in issues #2\u20133, by Anne Caulfield; both had art by [[Ian Gibson (comics)|Ian Gibson]].\n\nIn 1990 Acme teamed with Eclipse to release [[Eddie Campbell]]'s ''The Complete Alec'',<ref>Yang, Sam. \"A Loaf of Bread, A Jug of Wine and Eddie Campbell,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #145 (Oct. 1991), p. 59.</ref> which collected three previous \"Alec\" publications \u2014 ''Alec'' (1984), ''Love and Beerglasses'' (1985), and ''Doggie in the Window'' (1986) \u2014 together with some unpublished material. The collection won the 1991 [[UK Comic Art Award]] for Best Graphic Novel Collection.<ref name=TCJ142>\"British Awards Announced,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #142 (June 1991), p. 17.</ref> \n\nAcme/Eclipse published ''Velocity'' #4 in 1991. Written by Gary Pleece and illustrated by [[Warren Pleece]], it was the \"first U.S. issue\" of what had previously been the brother's self-publishing venture from 1987 to 1989. A satirical collection of stories, there were no recurring characters, but many recognizable caricatures from politics and pop culture.\n\nAcme reorganized in 1991, changing its name from Acme Press to '''Acme Comics'''.\n\n=== Dark Horse/Acme ===\nAcme's relationship with Eclipse ended in 1992 (Eclipse would go defunct a year later), and Acme struck up a new arrangement with another up-and-coming American black-and-white publisher, [[Dark Horse Comics]]. With Dark Horse, Acme acted more as a [[Book packager|packager]] rather than a co-publisher. (The Acme logo was styled to look like a Dark Horse imprint.) The comics the two companies produced were strictly James Bond titles (edited by Hansom) and the nine-issue series ''Lux & Alby Sign on and Save the Universe'', by [[Martin Millar]] and [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]]. (Another James Bond story, \"Operation Miasma\" by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Russ Heath]], appeared in the ''Dark Horse Comics'' anthology, issue #25, published Sept. 1994.) Co-founder Dick Hansom, though not technically working for Acme at the time, edited [[Bryan Talbot]]'s ''[[The Tale of One Bad Rat]]'', published by Dark Horse in 1994\u20131995.<ref name=WhosWhoHansom />\n\nAcme's partnership with Dark Horse lasted until 1995.\n\n=== Closure and further careers of the founders ===\nAcme went defunct in 1995. Co-founders Ashford, Ridout, and Bambos all found work in the mainstream comics industry for a time.\n\nBambos left Acme in 1988, moving on to [[Dave Elliott (comics)|Dave Elliott]] and [[Garry Leach]]'s [[Atomeka Press]], where he worked until 1990. In the early 1990s, he found some work as a cover inker for [[Marvel Comics]].<ref name=WhosWhoBambos>[http://bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=GEORGIOU%2C+BAMBOS Bambos entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928\u20131999''. Retrieved Jan. 8, 2020.</ref>\n\nAshford appears to have left Acme around 1989. He had latched on with Marvel in 1988, first as an editorial assistant with the company until 1991. He worked freelance as an assistant editor at Marvel from 1991 to 1994, while performing the same duties at DC Comics.<ref name=WhosWhoAshford>[http://bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=ASHFORD%2C+DICK Ashford entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928\u20131999''.

He wrote a two-part [[Scarlet Witch]] story in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' in 1993, and worked as an editor for [[Marvel UK]] (on the ''[[Doctor Who (comics)|Doctor Who: Classic Comics]]'' series) in 1994. He wrote the ''[[Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty]]'' graphic novel  (which was edited by Ashford), published by Marvel in 1995.<ref>[http://bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=RIDOUT%2C+CEFN Ridout entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928\u20131999''.
