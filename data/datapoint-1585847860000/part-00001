McBrien, ed., ''The Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism'', Harper Collins, 1995.</ref> However, CELAM never supported liberation theology as such, since liberation theology was frowned upon by the Vatican, with [[Pope Paul VI]] trying to slow the movement after the Second Vatican Council.<ref>According to Cardinal [[Alfonso L\u00f3pez Trujillo]], liberation theology was simultaneously created by the [[Reflection Task Force]] of CELAM, and by [[Rubem Alves]]'s book, ''[[Towards a Theology of Liberation]]'' (1968). However, Cardinal Trujillo had himself been general secretary of CELAM, and president of CELAM's Reflection Task Force. [[Antonio Samor\u00e8|Cardinal Samor\u00e8]], who as leader of the [[Pontifical Commission for Latin America]] was in charge of relations between the [[Roman Curia]] and CELAM, was ordered to put a stop to liberation theology, which was judged antithetical to the Catholic Church's global teachings.</ref>{{citation needed|reason=Previous note does not give sources for CELAM's attitude to Lib Theol|date=May 2015}}\n\nMore or less at the same time as the initial publications of Latin American liberation theology are also found voices of [[black theology|Black liberation theology]] and [[feminist theology|feminist liberation theology]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=2005|title=Liberation Theology|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/liberation_theology.aspx|journal=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas|last1=Vuola|first1=Elina|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second Vatican Council, CELAM held two conferences which were important in determining the future of liberation theology: [[Second Episcopal Conference of Latin America|the first]] was held in [[Conference of Latin American Bishops|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]], in 1968, and the second in [[Puebla]], Mexico, in January 1979.<ref name=\"Pelton 1995\" /> The Medell\u00edn conference debated how to apply the teachings of Vatican II to Latin America, and its conclusions were strongly influenced by liberation theology.<ref name=\"Wojda, Paul J. 1995\" /> Although liberation theology grew out of these officially recognized ideas, the Medell\u00edn document is not a liberation theology document. It did, however, lay the groundwork, and since then liberation theology has developed rapidly in the Latin American Catholic Church.<ref name=\"Williams\">''Liberation Theology and Its Role in Latin America''.

The College of William and Mary.</ref>\n\nCardinal [[Alfonso L\u00f3pez Trujillo]] was a central figure after the Medell\u00edn Conference, who as priest in Bogota he did not attend, and was elected in 1972 as general secretary of CELAM, and then, its president in 1979 (at the Puebla conference). He represented a more orthodox position, becoming a favourite of [[Pope John Paul II]] and the \"principal scourge of liberation theology.\"<ref name=\"Curti\">{{cite magazine |first=Elena |last=Curti |title=Study in Scarlet |magazine=The Tablet |date=May 8, 2010 |p=4 <!--4,5,13--> |issn=0039-8837 |url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/}} (Available upon request)</ref> Trujillo's faction became predominant in CELAM after the 1972 [[Sucre]] conference, and in the Roman Curia after the CELAM conference in [[Puebla]], Mexico, in January 1979.\n\nDespite the orthodox bishops' predominance in CELAM, a more radical form of liberation theology remained much supported in South America. Thus, the 1979 Puebla Conference was an opportunity for orthodox bishops to reassert control of the radical elements, but they failed. At the Puebla Conference, the orthodox reorientation was met by strong opposition from the liberal part of the clergy, which supported the concept of a \"[[preferential option for the poor]]\". This concept had been approved at the Medell\u00edn conference by Ricard Durand, president of the [[Commission about Poverty]].\n\nPope John Paul II gave the opening speech at the Puebla Conference. The general tone of his remarks was conciliatory. He criticized radical liberation theology, saying, \"this idea of Christ as a political figure, a revolutionary, as the subversive of Nazareth, does not tally with the Church's [[Catechism|catechesis]]\";<ref name=\"Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/speeches/1979/january/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19790128_messico-puebla-episc-latam.html|title=To members of the 3rd General Conference of the Latin American Episcopate, Puebla \u2013 Republic of Mexico (January 28, 1979) \u2013 John Paul II|website=w2.vatican.va|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}</ref> however, he did acknowledge that \"the growing wealth of a few parallels the growing poverty of the masses,\"<ref name=\"Speech\" /> and affirmed both the ''principle'' of private property and that the Church \"must preach, educate individuals and collectivities, form public opinion, and offer orientations to the leaders of the peoples\" towards the goal of a \"more just and equitable distribution of goods\".<ref name=\"Speech\" />\n\nSome liberation theologians, however, including Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, had been barred from attending the Puebla Conference. Working from a seminary and with aid from sympathetic, liberal bishops, they partially obstructed other clergy's efforts to ensure that the Puebla Conference documents satisfied conservative concerns. Within four hours of the Pope's speech, Guti\u00e9rrez and the other priests wrote a 20-page refutation, which was circulated at the conference, and has been claimed to have influenced the final outcome of the conference. According to a socio-political study of liberation theology in Latin America, a quarter of the final Puebla documents were written by theologians who were ''not invited'' to the conference.<ref>Smith, Christian. ''The Emergence of Liberation Theology''</ref>\n\n=== Theology ===\nLiberation theology could be interpreted as an attempt to return to the [[gospel]] of the [[early church]] where Christianity is politically and culturally decentralized.<ref>ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEOPLES, Populorum Progressio, Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Pope Paul VI promulgated on March 26, 1967</ref>\n\nLiberation theology proposes to fight poverty by addressing its alleged source, the [[sin]] of greed. In so doing, it explores the relationship between [[Christian theology]] (especially [[Roman Catholic theology|Roman Catholic]]) and political activism, especially in relation to [[economic justice]], [[poverty]], and [[human rights]]. The principal methodological innovation is seeing theology from the perspective of the poor and the oppressed. For example, [[Jon Sobrino]] argues that the poor are a privileged channel of [[Grace (Christianity)|God's grace]].\n\nSome liberation theologians base their social action upon the [[Bible]] scriptures describing the mission of [[Jesus Christ]], as [[But to bring a sword|bringing a sword]] ([[social unrest]]), e.g., {{bible verse||Isaiah|61:1|KJV}}, {{bible verse||Matthew|10:34|KJV}}, {{bible verse||Luke|22:35\u201338|KJV}} \u2014 and ''not'' as bringing peace ([[social order]]).{{Better source|date=May 2010}} This biblical interpretation is a call to ''action'' against poverty, and the sin engendering it, to affect Jesus Christ's mission of justice in this world.\n\n[[Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez]] gave the movement its name with his 1971 book, ''A Theology of Liberation''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Teolog\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n: perspectivas|last=Guti\u00e9rrez|first=Gustavo|publisher=Centro de Estudios y Publicaciones (CEP)|year=1971|isbn=|location=Lima, Per\u00fa|pages=}}</ref> In this book, Guti\u00e9rrez combined populist ideas with the social teachings of the Catholic Church. He was influenced by an existing socialist current in the Church which included organizations such as the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and the ''[[Jeunesse Ouvri\u00e8re Chr\u00e9tienne]]'', a Belgian Christian youth worker organization. He was also influenced by [[Paul Gauthier (theologian)|Paul Gauthier]]'s ''[[The Poor, Jesus and the Church]]'' (1965). Guti\u00e9rrez's book is based on an understanding of history in which the human being is seen as assuming conscious responsibility for human destiny, and yet Christ the Saviour liberates the human race from sin, which is the root of all disruption of friendship and of all injustice and oppression.<ref>Gustavo Gutierrez, ''A Theology of Liberation''(London: SCM Press,1974) 36f</ref>\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez also popularized the phrase \"[[preferential option for the poor]]\", which became a slogan of liberation theology and later appeared in addresses of the Pope.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ratzinger | first = Joseph | authorlink = Pope Benedict XVI | title = Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Fathers of the General Congregation of the Society of Jesus | website = Speeches February 2008 | publisher = The Holy See | date = February 21, 2008 | url = https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/february/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080221_gesuiti_en.html }}</ref> Drawing from the biblical motif on the poor, Guti\u00e9rrez asserts that God is revealed as having a preference for those people who are \u201cinsignificant\", \"marginalized\", \u201cunimportant\", \"needy\", \"despised\", and \"defenseless\". Moreover, he makes clear that terminology of \"the poor\" in scripture has social and economic connotations that etymologically go back to the Greek word, ''pt\u014dchos''.<ref>Gutierrez, Gustavo. The God of Life. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1991. (Original: El Dios de la vida. Lima: CEP, 1989.) p. 112</ref> To be sure, as to not misinterpret Guti\u00e9rrez's definition of the term \"preferential option\", he stresses, \"Preference implies the universality of God\u2019s love, which excludes no one. It is only within the framework of this universality that we can understand the preference, that is, 'what comes first'.\"<ref>Nickoloff, James B. ed. Gustavo Gutierrez: Essential Writings. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1996, p. 145</ref>\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez emphasized practice (or, more technically, \"[[praxis (process)|praxis]]\") over doctrine.  Guti\u00e9rrez clarified his position by advocating a circular relationship between [[orthodoxy]] and [[orthopraxis]] seeing the two as having a symbiotic relationship.<ref>Gutierrez, Gustavo. The Truth Shall Make You Free: Confrontations. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1990. (Original: La verdad los hara libres: confrontaciones. Lima: CEP, 1986)</ref> Gutierrez' reading of prophets condemning oppression and injustice against the poor (i.e., Jeremiah 22:13\u201317) informs his assertion that to know God (orthodoxy) is to do justice (orthopraxis).<ref>Gutierrez, Gustavo. The Power of Poor in History. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1983. (Original: La fuerza historica de los obres: seleccion de trabajos. Lima: CEP, 1971.)</ref> Cardinal [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] (later Pope Benedict XVI), however, criticized liberation theology for elevating orthopraxis to the level of orthodoxy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ratzinger, Joseph Cardinal (2007). \"Liberation Theology: Preliminary Notes,\" in The Ratzinger Report.|title=Reprinted in: J.F. Thornton and S.B. Varenne, eds., The Essential Pope Benedict XVI|year=2007|publisher=Online version: Harper Collins}}</ref> Richard McBrien summarizes this concept as follows:\n\n<blockquote>God is disclosed in the historical \"praxis\" of liberation. It is the situation, and our passionate and reflective involvement in it, which mediates the Word of God. Today that Word is mediated through the cries of the poor and the oppressed.<ref>McBrien, R.P. \"Catholicism\" (Harper Collins, 1995), pp. 249\u2013250.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother important hallmark for Guti\u00e9rrez's brand of liberation theology is an interpretation of revelation as \"history\". For example, Guti\u00e9rrez wrote:\n\n<blockquote>History is the scene of the revelation God makes of the mystery of his person. His word reaches us in the measure of our involvement in the evolution of history.<ref>Gutierrez, G. \"Faith as Freedom,\" \u2018\u2019Horizons\u2019\u2019 2/1, Spring 1975, p.32</ref></blockquote>\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez also considered the Church to be the \"sacrament of history\", an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace, thus pointing to the doctrine of universal salvation as the true means to eternal life, and assigning the Church itself to a somewhat temporal role, namely, liberation.\n\n=== Practice ===\nOne of the most radical aspects of liberation theology was the social organization, or reorganization, of church practice through the model of [[Christian base communities]]. Liberation theology strove to be a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] movement in practice, with biblical interpretation and liturgical practice designed by lay practitioners themselves, rather than by the orthodox Church hierarchy. In this context, sacred text interpretation is understood as \"praxis\". Liberation theology seeks to interpret the actions of the Catholic Church and the teachings of Jesus Christ from the perspective of the poor and disadvantaged. In Latin America, liberation theologians specifically target the severe disparities between rich and poor in the existing social and economic orders within the nations' political and corporate structures. It is a strong critique of the various economic and social structures, such as an oppressive government, dependence upon First World countries and the traditional hierarchical Church, that allow some to be extremely rich while others are unable to even have safe drinking water.<ref name=Williams />\n\nThe journalist and writer [[Penny Lernoux]] described this aspect of liberation theology in her numerous and committed writings intended to explain the movement's ideas in North America. Base communities were small gatherings, usually outside of churches, in which the Bible could be discussed, and Mass could be said. They were especially active in rural parts of Latin America where parish priests were not always available, as they placed a high value on [[Laity|lay]] participation. In May 2007, it was estimated that 80,000 base communities existed in Brazil.<ref name=\"nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/world/americas/07theology.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5089&en=34f757c655dbef9f&ex=1336190400&partner=rssyahoo&emc=rss \"As Pope Heads to Brazil, a Rival Theology Persists\"] ''The New York Times'' May 7, 2007.</ref>\n\nContemporaneously, [[Fanmi Lavalas]] in [[Haiti]], the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] in [[Brazil]], and [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] are three organizations that make use of liberation theology.<ref>[http://betacanadaandtheworld.com/liberationtheology.html Liberation Theology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311004611/http://betacanadaandtheworld.com/liberationtheology.html |date=March 11, 2012 }}, Canada & the World, February 10, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Brazilian liberation theology ===\nThe Brazilian Catholic Church is arguably one of the most theologically progressive Catholic congregations due, in large part, to a history of violent military and political conflicts as well as a divisive socioeconomic climate. During [[Brazilian military government|Brazil's military rule]] from 1964 to 1985, the Catholic Church and its members assumed responsibility to provide services to the poor and disenfranchised, often under threat of persecution. The Vatican II and Medell\u00edn conference innovations in liberation theology entered the Brazilian Church as the Brazilian lower classes experienced sharply deteriorating economic and political conditions. Among these were an increase in landownership concentration, a decline in wages and standards of living, and a rise in the military state's political repression and violence, including mass detainment, torture, and the assassination of political opponents.<ref name=Gurupa />\n\n==== Base ecclesial communities ====\nAfter decades of repression from the government authorities, the liberationist Catholic Church in Brazil is absent of traditional centralization and encourages an increased lay participation. Faced with a severe priest shortage, much of the Brazilian Catholic Church is organized into Base Ecclesial Communities or, \"CEBs\" in which the Mass, community spirituality programs, and community needs are led or addressed by a single clergy member or a trained lay member in either a small chapel or an individual's home. The CEBs introduced new social ideas and democratic methods which led to many participants' active involvement in popular movements of Brazil that worked for progressive social change. An example of progressive social change initiated by the CEBs is in [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]]. A health program began there to try to organize the population in order to remedy widespread malnutrition, open sewers, and other health hazards.<ref name=Williams /> Eventually the neighbourhood initiative reached a national interest level where it then became a mass movement in nearly every neighbourhood. Initiatives like the health program in Nova Igua\u00e7u illustrate how CEBs have helped the transition from military to democratic rule.\n\nWhile liberation theology has brought about significant progressive reforms in Brazil, anthropologist Robin Nagle questions the effectiveness of Catholic Church theology in Brazil. Nagle concentrates on the conflict between conservatives and liberationists in [[Recife]], Brazil, in 1990. The poor neighbourhood of Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o had a liberationist priest named Reginaldo who was expelled by the traditionalist archbishop because the archbishop found Reginaldo's politics and social theology annoying and adverse to his own agenda. When Reginaldo and his followers refused to accept the expulsion and the new priest, the archbishop called in the Military Police. Conversely, the event did not cause a mass response because the liberationist agenda aroused distrust and even hatred among many of its intended audience. The main reason was that it was too much to ask poor parishioners to embrace a Church focused more on the troubles of this life than solace in the next.<ref name=Virgin>''Claiming the Virgin:The Broken Promise of Liberation Theology in Brazil''. Robin Nagle. New York: Routledge, 1997. xii+224 pp., addendums, notes, glossary, bibliography, index.</ref>\n\nWhile Robin Nagle claims that liberation theology is ineffective for genuine social change, anthropologist Manuel V\u00e1squez argues that liberation theology embraced by CEBs create a twofold effect, because it not only provided moral justification for resistance but it also served as a means to organize the resistance. Many people come to the CEB through conversion experiences, but also because they are keenly concerned with the spiritual and infrastructural needs of their community.<ref name=Vasquez>The Brazilian Popular Church and the Crisis of Modernity. Manuel A. Vasquez. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 302 pp.</ref> Through his fieldwork in working-class neighbourhoods of [[Rio de Janeiro]], V\u00e1squez reveals that CEBs combat disenfranchisement but also serve to overcome the obstacles associated with materialism and globalization. The social and political impact can be viewed in terms of initial consciousness-raising, the motivation for involvement, the sense of community they develop, the experience of grassroots democracy, the direct actions they engage in, and finally, directly political actions.<ref name=Williams />\n\n==== Liberation theology and indigenous Brazil ====\n\n===== The Tapeba =====\nAnthropologist and author Max Maranh\u00e3o Piorsky Aires analyzes the influence of liberation theology on the transformation of the indigenous [[Tapeba people]] of Brazil from poor, uneducated inhabitants neglected by the state to rights-bearing and involved citizens. Specifically he largely attributes the work of the Brazilian Catholic Church to the progression of the Tapeba. The Catholic Church enlisted state authorities, [[anthropologist]]s, and journalists to help uncover the identity of neglected indigenous peoples of Brazil. Early recognition by missionaries and followers of liberation theology stimulated indigenous identification of the Tapeba population as a possibility for attaining rights, especially land, health, and education.<ref name=Tapeba>{{cite journal | last1 = Maranhao Piorsky Aires | first1 = Max | year = 2012 | title = Legalizing Indigenous Identities: The Tapeba Struggle for Land and Schools in Caucaia, Brazil | url = | journal = The Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 320\u2013340 }}</ref> The Church gathered and contributed historical knowledge of indigenous territory and identity of the Tapeba in Caucaia that ultimately succeeded in the tribes obtaining a legally codified identity as well as a rightful place as Brazilian subjects.\n\n===== Gurup\u00e1 =====\nIn [[Gurup\u00e1]], the Catholic Church employed liberation theology to defend indigenous tribes, farmers, and extractors from land expropriation by federal or corporate forces. New religious ideas, in the form of liberation theology, have fortified and legitimized an evolving political culture of resistance.<ref name=Gurupa>{{cite journal | last1 = Pace | first1 = R | year = 1992 | title = Social conflict and political activism in the Brazilian Amazon: a case study of Gurup\u00e1 | url = | journal = American Ethnologist | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 710\u2013732 | doi = 10.1525/ae.1992.19.4.02a00050 }}</ref> Meanwhile, the Church-supported Base Ecclesial Communities (CEBs) have promoted stronger social connections among community members that has led to more effective activism in Gurup\u00e1. Anthropologist Richard Pace's study of Gurup\u00e1 revealed that CEBs assured safety in united activism, and, combined with liberation theology, encouraged members to challenge landowner's commercial monopolies and fight for better standards of living. Pace references a specific incident in the CEB of [[Nossa Senhora de F\u00e1tima, Santa Maria|Nossa Senhora de F\u00e1tima]], in which a community of 24 families of farmers, timber extractors, and traders resisted an extra-regional timber extraction firm. The community negotiated an agreement with the firm that gained them a higher standard of living that included imported goods, increased food availability, and access to health care. While severe social dislocations such as government-initiated capitalist penetration, land expropriation, and poor wages persist, small-farmer activism is fortified by liberation theology and receives structural support from unions, political parties, and church organizations.<ref name=Gurupa />\n\n=== Vatican reaction ===\n\n==== Joseph Ratzinger ====\nIn March 1983, Cardinal [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), head of the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (CDF), made ten observations of Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez's theology, accusing Guti\u00e9rrez of politically interpreting the Bible in supporting temporal messianism, and stating that the predominance of [[orthopraxis]] over orthodoxy in his thought proved a Marxist influence. Ratzinger objected that the spiritual concept of the Church as \"People of God\" is transformed into a \"Marxist myth\". In liberation theology he declared, the \"'people' is the antithesis of the hierarchy, the antithesis of all institutions, which are seen as oppressive powers. Ultimately anyone who participates in the class struggle is a member of the 'people'; the 'Church of the people' becomes the antagonist of the hierarchical Church.\"<ref name=preliminary>{{cite book|last=Ratzinger|first=Joseph Cardinal|title=\"Liberation Theology: Preliminary Notes,\" in The Ratzinger Report.

Nonetheless, media reports tended to assume that the condemnation of \"liberation theology\" meant a rejection of such attitudes and an endorsement of [[conservative]] politics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nIn 1984, it was reported that a meeting occurred between the CDF and the CELAM bishops, during which a rift developed between Ratzinger and some of the bishops,<ref name=\"Curti\" />  with Ratzinger issuing official condemnations of certain elements of liberation theology.<ref>{{cite book|last=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|title=\"Instruction on certain aspects of the 'Theology of Liberation,'\" Origins 14/13|date=September 13, 1984|location=Online version}}[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19840806_theology-liberation_en.html Online version]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, .|title=\"Instruction on Christian Freedom and Liberation,\" Origins 15/44|date=April 17, 1986}}</ref> These \"Instructions\" rejected as Marxist the idea that [[class struggle]] is fundamental to history, and rejected the interpretation of religious phenomena such as the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] and the [[Eucharist]] in exclusively political terms.  Ratzinger further stated that liberation theology had a major flaw in that it attempted to apply Christ's sermon on the mount teachings about the poor to present social situations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ratzinger|first=Cardinal|title=op cit|year=1985}}</ref>  He asserted that Christ's teaching on the poor meant that we will be judged when we die, with particular attention to how we personally have treated the poor.\n\nRatzinger also argued that liberation theology is not originally a \"grass-roots\" movement among the poor, but rather, a creation of Western intellectuals: \"an attempt to test, in a concrete scenario, ideologies that have been invented in the laboratory by European theologians\" and in a certain sense itself a form of \"[[cultural imperialism]]\". Ratzinger saw this as a reaction to the demise or near-demise of the \"Marxist myth\" in the West.<ref name=preliminary />\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Ratzinger, as prefect of the CDF, continued to condemn these elements in liberation theology, and prohibited dissident priests from teaching such doctrines in the Catholic Church's name. [[Leonardo Boff]] was suspended and others were censured. [[Tissa Balasuriya]], in [[Sri Lanka]], was excommunicated. [[Sebastian Kappen]], an Indian theologian, was also censured for his book ''Jesus and Freedom''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kappen|first=Sebastian|title=Jesus and Freedom. In 1980, the CDF asked the General of the Society of Jesus (of which Kappen was a member) to disavow this book. Kappen responded with a pamphlet entitled \"Censorship and the Future of Asian Theology.\" No further action was taken by the Vatican on this matter|year=1977}}</ref> Under Ratzinger's influence, theological formation schools were forbidden from using the Catholic Church's organization and grounds to teach liberation theology in the sense of theology using unacceptable Marxist ideas, not in the broader sense.\n\n==== Towards reconciliation under Pope Francis ====\nAccording to Roberto Bosca, a historian at [[Austral University (Argentina)|Austral University]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Pope Francis|Jorge Bergoglio]] (later Pope Francis) had \"a reputation as an opponent of liberation theology during the 1970s\" but he \"accepted the premise of liberation theology, especially the option for the poor, but in a 'nonideological' fashion.\"<ref name=Allen2013 /> Before becoming Pope, Bergoglio said, \"The option for the poor comes from the first centuries of Christianity. It's the Gospel itself.

As a rule, this articulation involves a condemnation of the State of [[Israel]], a theological underpinning of Palestinian resistance to Israel as well as Palestinian national aspirations, and an intense valorization of Palestinian ethnic and cultural identity as guarantors of a truer grasp of the gospel by virtue of the fact that they are inhabitants of the land of [[Jesus]] and the [[Bible]].

Thus, the 1979 Puebla Conference was an opportunity for orthodox bishops to reassert control of the radical elements, but they failed. At the Puebla Conference, the orthodox reorientation was met by strong opposition from the liberal part of the clergy, which supported the concept of a \"[[preferential option for the poor]]\". This concept had been approved at the Medell\u00edn conference by Ricard Durand, president of the [[Commission about Poverty]].\n\nPope John Paul II gave the opening speech at the Puebla Conference. The general tone of his remarks was conciliatory. He criticized radical liberation theology, saying, \"this idea of Christ as a political figure, a revolutionary, as the subversive of Nazareth, does not tally with the Church's [[Catechism|catechesis]]\";<ref name=\"Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/speeches/1979/january/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19790128_messico-puebla-episc-latam.html|title=To members of the 3rd General Conference of the Latin American Episcopate, Puebla \u2013 Republic of Mexico (January 28, 1979) \u2013 John Paul II|website=w2.vatican.va|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}</ref> however, he did acknowledge that \"the growing wealth of a few parallels the growing poverty of the masses,\"<ref name=\"Speech\" /> and affirmed both the ''principle'' of private property and that the Church \"must preach, educate individuals and collectivities, form public opinion, and offer orientations to the leaders of the peoples\" towards the goal of a \"more just and equitable distribution of goods\".<ref name=\"Speech\" />\n\nSome liberation theologians, however, including Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, had been barred from attending the Puebla Conference. Working from a seminary and with aid from sympathetic, liberal bishops, they partially obstructed other clergy's efforts to ensure that the Puebla Conference documents satisfied conservative concerns. Within four hours of the Pope's speech, Guti\u00e9rrez and the other priests wrote a 20-page refutation, which was circulated at the conference, and has been claimed to have influenced the final outcome of the conference. According to a socio-political study of liberation theology in Latin America, a quarter of the final Puebla documents were written by theologians who were ''not invited'' to the conference.<ref>Smith, Christian. ''The Emergence of Liberation Theology''</ref>\n\n=== Theology ===\nLiberation theology could be interpreted as an attempt to return to the [[gospel]] of the [[early church]] where Christianity is politically and culturally decentralized.<ref>ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEOPLES, Populorum Progressio, Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Pope Paul VI promulgated on March 26, 1967</ref>\n\nLiberation theology proposes to fight poverty by addressing its alleged source, the [[sin]] of greed. In so doing, it explores the relationship between [[Christian theology]] (especially [[Roman Catholic theology|Roman Catholic]]) and political activism, especially in relation to [[economic justice]], [[poverty]], and [[human rights]]. The principal methodological innovation is seeing theology from the perspective of the poor and the oppressed. For example, [[Jon Sobrino]] argues that the poor are a privileged channel of [[Grace (Christianity)|God's grace]].\n\nSome liberation theologians base their social action upon the [[Bible]] scriptures describing the mission of [[Jesus Christ]], as [[But to bring a sword|bringing a sword]] ([[social unrest]]), e.g., {{bible verse||Isaiah|61:1|KJV}}, {{bible verse||Matthew|10:34|KJV}}, {{bible verse||Luke|22:35\u201338|KJV}} \u2014 and ''not'' as bringing peace ([[social order]]).{{Better source|date=May 2010}} This biblical interpretation is a call to ''action'' against poverty, and the sin engendering it, to affect Jesus Christ's mission of justice in this world.\n\n[[Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez]] gave the movement its name with his 1971 book, ''A Theology of Liberation''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Teolog\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n: perspectivas|last=Guti\u00e9rrez|first=Gustavo|publisher=Centro de Estudios y Publicaciones (CEP)|year=1971|isbn=|location=Lima, Per\u00fa|pages=}}</ref> In this book, Guti\u00e9rrez combined populist ideas with the social teachings of the Catholic Church. He was influenced by an existing socialist current in the Church which included organizations such as the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and the ''[[Jeunesse Ouvri\u00e8re Chr\u00e9tienne]]'', a Belgian Christian youth worker organization. He was also influenced by [[Paul Gauthier (theologian)|Paul Gauthier]]'s ''[[The Poor, Jesus and the Church]]'' (1965). Guti\u00e9rrez's book is based on an understanding of history in which the human being is seen as assuming conscious responsibility for human destiny, and yet Christ the Saviour liberates the human race from sin, which is the root of all disruption of friendship and of all injustice and oppression.<ref>Gustavo Gutierrez, ''A Theology of Liberation''(London: SCM Press,1974) 36f</ref>\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez also popularized the phrase \"[[preferential option for the poor]]\", which became a slogan of liberation theology and later appeared in addresses of the Pope.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ratzinger | first = Joseph | authorlink = Pope Benedict XVI | title = Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Fathers of the General Congregation of the Society of Jesus | website = Speeches February 2008 | publisher = The Holy See | date = February 21, 2008 | url = https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/february/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080221_gesuiti_en.html }}</ref> Drawing from the biblical motif on the poor, Guti\u00e9rrez asserts that God is revealed as having a preference for those people who are \u201cinsignificant\", \"marginalized\", \u201cunimportant\", \"needy\", \"despised\", and \"defenseless\". Moreover, he makes clear that terminology of \"the poor\" in scripture has social and economic connotations that etymologically go back to the Greek word, ''pt\u014dchos''.<ref>Gutierrez, Gustavo. The God of Life. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1991. (Original: El Dios de la vida. Lima: CEP, 1989.) p. 112</ref> To be sure, as to not misinterpret Guti\u00e9rrez's definition of the term \"preferential option\", he stresses, \"Preference implies the universality of God\u2019s love, which excludes no one. It is only within the framework of this universality that we can understand the preference, that is, 'what comes first'.\"<ref>Nickoloff, James B. ed. Gustavo Gutierrez: Essential Writings. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1996, p. 145</ref>\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez emphasized practice (or, more technically, \"[[praxis (process)|praxis]]\") over doctrine.  Guti\u00e9rrez clarified his position by advocating a circular relationship between [[orthodoxy]] and [[orthopraxis]] seeing the two as having a symbiotic relationship.<ref>Gutierrez, Gustavo.

Thornton and S.B. Varenne, eds., The Essential Pope Benedict XVI|year=2007|publisher=Online version: Harper Collins}}</ref> Richard McBrien summarizes this concept as follows:\n\n<blockquote>God is disclosed in the historical \"praxis\" of liberation. It is the situation, and our passionate and reflective involvement in it, which mediates the Word of God. Today that Word is mediated through the cries of the poor and the oppressed.<ref>McBrien, R.P. \"Catholicism\" (Harper Collins, 1995), pp. 249\u2013250.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother important hallmark for Guti\u00e9rrez's brand of liberation theology is an interpretation of revelation as \"history\". For example, Guti\u00e9rrez wrote:\n\n<blockquote>History is the scene of the revelation God makes of the mystery of his person. His word reaches us in the measure of our involvement in the evolution of history.<ref>Gutierrez, G. \"Faith as Freedom,\" \u2018\u2019Horizons\u2019\u2019 2/1, Spring 1975, p.32</ref></blockquote>\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez also considered the Church to be the \"sacrament of history\", an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace, thus pointing to the doctrine of universal salvation as the true means to eternal life, and assigning the Church itself to a somewhat temporal role, namely, liberation.\n\n=== Practice ===\nOne of the most radical aspects of liberation theology was the social organization, or reorganization, of church practice through the model of [[Christian base communities]]. Liberation theology strove to be a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] movement in practice, with biblical interpretation and liturgical practice designed by lay practitioners themselves, rather than by the orthodox Church hierarchy. In this context, sacred text interpretation is understood as \"praxis\". Liberation theology seeks to interpret the actions of the Catholic Church and the teachings of Jesus Christ from the perspective of the poor and disadvantaged. In Latin America, liberation theologians specifically target the severe disparities between rich and poor in the existing social and economic orders within the nations' political and corporate structures. It is a strong critique of the various economic and social structures, such as an oppressive government, dependence upon First World countries and the traditional hierarchical Church, that allow some to be extremely rich while others are unable to even have safe drinking water.<ref name=Williams />\n\nThe journalist and writer [[Penny Lernoux]] described this aspect of liberation theology in her numerous and committed writings intended to explain the movement's ideas in North America. Base communities were small gatherings, usually outside of churches, in which the Bible could be discussed, and Mass could be said. They were especially active in rural parts of Latin America where parish priests were not always available, as they placed a high value on [[Laity|lay]] participation. In May 2007, it was estimated that 80,000 base communities existed in Brazil.<ref name=\"nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/world/americas/07theology.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5089&en=34f757c655dbef9f&ex=1336190400&partner=rssyahoo&emc=rss \"As Pope Heads to Brazil, a Rival Theology Persists\"] ''The New York Times'' May 7, 2007.</ref>\n\nContemporaneously, [[Fanmi Lavalas]] in [[Haiti]], the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] in [[Brazil]], and [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] are three organizations that make use of liberation theology.<ref>[http://betacanadaandtheworld.com/liberationtheology.html Liberation Theology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311004611/http://betacanadaandtheworld.com/liberationtheology.html |date=March 11, 2012 }}, Canada & the World, February 10, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Brazilian liberation theology ===\nThe Brazilian Catholic Church is arguably one of the most theologically progressive Catholic congregations due, in large part, to a history of violent military and political conflicts as well as a divisive socioeconomic climate. During [[Brazilian military government|Brazil's military rule]] from 1964 to 1985, the Catholic Church and its members assumed responsibility to provide services to the poor and disenfranchised, often under threat of persecution. The Vatican II and Medell\u00edn conference innovations in liberation theology entered the Brazilian Church as the Brazilian lower classes experienced sharply deteriorating economic and political conditions. Among these were an increase in landownership concentration, a decline in wages and standards of living, and a rise in the military state's political repression and violence, including mass detainment, torture, and the assassination of political opponents.<ref name=Gurupa />\n\n==== Base ecclesial communities ====\nAfter decades of repression from the government authorities, the liberationist Catholic Church in Brazil is absent of traditional centralization and encourages an increased lay participation. Faced with a severe priest shortage, much of the Brazilian Catholic Church is organized into Base Ecclesial Communities or, \"CEBs\" in which the Mass, community spirituality programs, and community needs are led or addressed by a single clergy member or a trained lay member in either a small chapel or an individual's home. The CEBs introduced new social ideas and democratic methods which led to many participants' active involvement in popular movements of Brazil that worked for progressive social change. An example of progressive social change initiated by the CEBs is in [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]]. A health program began there to try to organize the population in order to remedy widespread malnutrition, open sewers, and other health hazards.<ref name=Williams /> Eventually the neighbourhood initiative reached a national interest level where it then became a mass movement in nearly every neighbourhood. Initiatives like the health program in Nova Igua\u00e7u illustrate how CEBs have helped the transition from military to democratic rule.\n\nWhile liberation theology has brought about significant progressive reforms in Brazil, anthropologist Robin Nagle questions the effectiveness of Catholic Church theology in Brazil. Nagle concentrates on the conflict between conservatives and liberationists in [[Recife]], Brazil, in 1990. The poor neighbourhood of Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o had a liberationist priest named Reginaldo who was expelled by the traditionalist archbishop because the archbishop found Reginaldo's politics and social theology annoying and adverse to his own agenda. When Reginaldo and his followers refused to accept the expulsion and the new priest, the archbishop called in the Military Police. Conversely, the event did not cause a mass response because the liberationist agenda aroused distrust and even hatred among many of its intended audience. The main reason was that it was too much to ask poor parishioners to embrace a Church focused more on the troubles of this life than solace in the next.<ref name=Virgin>''Claiming the Virgin:The Broken Promise of Liberation Theology in Brazil''. Robin Nagle. New York: Routledge, 1997. xii+224 pp., addendums, notes, glossary, bibliography, index.</ref>\n\nWhile Robin Nagle claims that liberation theology is ineffective for genuine social change, anthropologist Manuel V\u00e1squez argues that liberation theology embraced by CEBs create a twofold effect, because it not only provided moral justification for resistance but it also served as a means to organize the resistance. Many people come to the CEB through conversion experiences, but also because they are keenly concerned with the spiritual and infrastructural needs of their community.<ref name=Vasquez>The Brazilian Popular Church and the Crisis of Modernity. Manuel A. Vasquez. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 302 pp.</ref> Through his fieldwork in working-class neighbourhoods of [[Rio de Janeiro]], V\u00e1squez reveals that CEBs combat disenfranchisement but also serve to overcome the obstacles associated with materialism and globalization. The social and political impact can be viewed in terms of initial consciousness-raising, the motivation for involvement, the sense of community they develop, the experience of grassroots democracy, the direct actions they engage in, and finally, directly political actions.<ref name=Williams />\n\n==== Liberation theology and indigenous Brazil ====\n\n===== The Tapeba =====\nAnthropologist and author Max Maranh\u00e3o Piorsky Aires analyzes the influence of liberation theology on the transformation of the indigenous [[Tapeba people]] of Brazil from poor, uneducated inhabitants neglected by the state to rights-bearing and involved citizens. Specifically he largely attributes the work of the Brazilian Catholic Church to the progression of the Tapeba. The Catholic Church enlisted state authorities, [[anthropologist]]s, and journalists to help uncover the identity of neglected indigenous peoples of Brazil. Early recognition by missionaries and followers of liberation theology stimulated indigenous identification of the Tapeba population as a possibility for attaining rights, especially land, health, and education.<ref name=Tapeba>''Legalizing Indigenous Identities: The Tapeba Struggle for Land and Schools in Caucaia, Brazil''. Max Maranhao Piorsky Aires. The Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 320\u2013340. 2012.</ref> The Church gathered and contributed historical knowledge of indigenous territory and identity of the Tapeba in Caucaia that ultimately succeeded in the tribes obtaining a legally codified identity as well as a rightful place as Brazilian subjects.\n\n===== Gurup\u00e1 =====\nIn [[Gurup\u00e1]], the Catholic Church employed liberation theology to defend indigenous tribes, farmers, and extractors from land expropriation by federal or corporate forces. New religious ideas, in the form of liberation theology, have fortified and legitimized an evolving political culture of resistance.<ref name=Gurupa>PACE, R. (1992), Social conflict and political activism in the Brazilian Amazon: a case study of Gurup\u00e1. American Ethnologist, 19: 710\u2013732. doi: 10.1525/ae.1992.19.4.02a00050</ref> Meanwhile, the Church-supported Base Ecclesial Communities (CEBs) have promoted stronger social connections among community members that has led to more effective activism in Gurup\u00e1. Anthropologist Richard Pace's study of Gurup\u00e1 revealed that CEBs assured safety in united activism, and, combined with liberation theology, encouraged members to challenge landowner's commercial monopolies and fight for better standards of living. Pace references a specific incident in the CEB of [[Nossa Senhora de F\u00e1tima, Santa Maria|Nossa Senhora de F\u00e1tima]], in which a community of 24 families of farmers, timber extractors, and traders resisted an extra-regional timber extraction firm. The community negotiated an agreement with the firm that gained them a higher standard of living that included imported goods, increased food availability, and access to health care. While severe social dislocations such as government-initiated capitalist penetration, land expropriation, and poor wages persist, small-farmer activism is fortified by liberation theology and receives structural support from unions, political parties, and church organizations.<ref name=Gurupa />\n\n=== Vatican reaction ===\n\n==== Joseph Ratzinger ====\nIn March 1983, Cardinal [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), head of the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (CDF), made ten observations of Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez's theology, accusing Guti\u00e9rrez of politically interpreting the Bible in supporting temporal messianism, and stating that the predominance of [[orthopraxis]] over orthodoxy in his thought proved a Marxist influence. Ratzinger objected that the spiritual concept of the Church as \"People of God\" is transformed into a \"Marxist myth\". In liberation theology he declared, the \"'people' is the antithesis of the hierarchy, the antithesis of all institutions, which are seen as oppressive powers. Ultimately anyone who participates in the class struggle is a member of the 'people'; the 'Church of the people' becomes the antagonist of the hierarchical Church.\"<ref name=preliminary>{{cite book|last=Ratzinger|first=Joseph Cardinal|title=\"Liberation Theology: Preliminary Notes,\" in The Ratzinger Report.

Nonetheless, media reports tended to assume that the condemnation of \"liberation theology\" meant a rejection of such attitudes and an endorsement of [[conservative]] politics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nIn 1984, it was reported that a meeting occurred between the CDF and the CELAM bishops, during which a rift developed between Ratzinger and some of the bishops,<ref name=\"Curti\" />  with Ratzinger issuing official condemnations of certain elements of liberation theology.<ref>{{cite book|last=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|title=\"Instruction on certain aspects of the 'Theology of Liberation,'\" Origins 14/13|date=September 13, 1984|location=Online version}}[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19840806_theology-liberation_en.html Online version]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, .|title=\"Instruction on Christian Freedom and Liberation,\" Origins 15/44|date=April 17, 1986}}</ref> These \"Instructions\" rejected as Marxist the idea that [[class struggle]] is fundamental to history, and rejected the interpretation of religious phenomena such as the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] and the [[Eucharist]] in exclusively political terms.  Ratzinger further stated that liberation theology had a major flaw in that it attempted to apply Christ's sermon on the mount teachings about the poor to present social situations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ratzinger|first=Cardinal|title=op cit|year=1985}}</ref>  He asserted that Christ's teaching on the poor meant that we will be judged when we die, with particular attention to how we personally have treated the poor.\n\nRatzinger also argued that liberation theology is not originally a \"grass-roots\" movement among the poor, but rather, a creation of Western intellectuals: \"an attempt to test, in a concrete scenario, ideologies that have been invented in the laboratory by European theologians\" and in a certain sense itself a form of \"[[cultural imperialism]]\". Ratzinger saw this as a reaction to the demise or near-demise of the \"Marxist myth\" in the West.<ref name=preliminary />\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Ratzinger, as prefect of the CDF, continued to condemn these elements in liberation theology, and prohibited dissident priests from teaching such doctrines in the Catholic Church's name. [[Leonardo Boff]] was suspended and others were censured. [[Tissa Balasuriya]], in [[Sri Lanka]], was excommunicated. [[Sebastian Kappen]], an Indian theologian, was also censured for his book ''Jesus and Freedom''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kappen|first=Sebastian|title=Jesus and Freedom. In 1980, the CDF asked the General of the Society of Jesus (of which Kappen was a member) to disavow this book. Kappen responded with a pamphlet entitled \"Censorship and the Future of Asian Theology.\" No further action was taken by the Vatican on this matter|year=1977}}</ref> Under Ratzinger's influence, theological formation schools were forbidden from using the Catholic Church's organization and grounds to teach liberation theology in the sense of theology using unacceptable Marxist ideas, not in the broader sense.\n\n==== Towards reconciliation under Pope Francis ====\nAccording to Roberto Bosca, a historian at [[Austral University (Argentina)|Austral University]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Pope Francis|Jorge Bergoglio]] (later Pope Francis) had \"a reputation as an opponent of liberation theology during the 1970s\" but he \"accepted the premise of liberation theology, especially the option for the poor, but in a 'nonideological' fashion.\"<ref name=Allen2013 /> Before becoming Pope, Bergoglio said, \"The option for the poor comes from the first centuries of Christianity. It's the Gospel itself. If you were to read one of the sermons of the first [[Church Fathers|fathers of the Church]], from the second or third centuries, about how you should treat the poor, you\u2019d say it was [[Maoism|Maoist]] or [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]]. The Church has always had the honor of this preferential option for the poor ...

It especially focuses on the [[injustice]]s committed against [[African American]]s and black [[South African people|South Africans]] during [[Jim Crow laws|American segregation]] and [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]], respectively.\n\nBlack theology seeks to liberate people of color from multiple forms of political, social, economic, and religious subjugation and views [[Christian theology]] as a theology of liberation\u2014\"a rational study of the being of God in the world in light of the existential situation of an oppressed community, relating the forces of liberation to the essence of the Gospel, which is [[Jesus]] Christ,\" writes [[James H. Cone|James Hal Cone]], one of the original advocates of the perspective. Black theology mixes [[Christianity]] with questions of [[civil rights]], particularly raised by the [[Black Power movement]] and the [[Black Consciousness Movement]].\n\n== Palestinian liberation theology ==\n{{See also|Political theology in the Middle East#Palestinian liberation theology}}\nPalestinian liberation theology is an expression of [[Political theology in the Middle East|political theology]] and a [[inculturation|contextual theology]] that represents an attempt by a number of independently working Palestinian theologians from various denominations\u2014mostly [[Protestant]] mainline churches\u2014to articulate the gospel message in such a way as to make that liberating gospel relevant to the perceived needs of their indigenous flocks. As a rule, this articulation involves a condemnation of the State of [[Israel]], a theological underpinning of Palestinian resistance to Israel as well as Palestinian national aspirations, and an intense valorization of Palestinian ethnic and cultural identity as guarantors of a truer grasp of the gospel by virtue of the fact that they are inhabitants of the land of [[Jesus]] and the [[Bible]]. The principal figure in Palestinian liberation theology is the [[Anglican]] cleric [[Naim Ateek]], founder of the [[Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center]] in [[Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ateek|first1=Naim|title=Justice and only Justice|date=1989|publisher=Orbis}}</ref>\n\n== Related movements ==\n* [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]]<ref name=\"interactivist\">{{cite web|url=http://abahlali.org/node/4890/|title=Interactivist: Liberation Theology \u2013 Abahlali baseMjondolo|publisher=abahlali.org}}</ref>\n* [[Dalit theology]] in [[India]]\n* [[Landless Workers' Movement]] in [[Brazil]]\n* [[Fanmi Lavalas|Lavalas]] in [[Haiti]]<ref name=\"interactivist\" />\n** [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]\n* [[FSLN]] in [[Nicaragua]] (see [[The Catholic Church and the Nicaraguan Revolution]])\n* [[FMLN]] in [[El Salvador]]\n* [[Christians for Socialism]] (Cristianos por el socialismo)\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Catholicism}}\n{{div col|colwidth=26em|content=\n*[[Buddhist socialism]]\n*[[Catholic Church and politics]]\n*[[Catholic social teaching]]\n*[[Christian left]]\n*[[Christian socialism]]\n*[[Christian views on poverty and wealth]]\n*[[Christianity and politics]]\n*[[Cuernavaca Center for Intercultural Dialogue on Development]]\n*[[Evangelical left]]\n*[[Islamic socialism]]\n*[[Liberal Christianity]]\n*[[Liberation theology in Canada]]\n*[[Marxism and religion]]\n*[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]\n*[[Political theology]]\n*[[Postcolonial theology]]\n*[[Progressive Christianity]]\n*[[Reconciliation theology]]\n*[[Religious socialism]]\n*[[Religious views on capitalism]]\n*[[Social Gospel]]\n*[[Spiritual left]]\n*[[Criticism of the Catholic Church#Liberation theology|Criticism of the Catholic Church \u00a7 Liberation theology]]\n}}\n\n=== People ===\n*[[Paulo Freire]]\n*[[\u00d3scar Romero]]\n\n==== Theologians ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\n{{div col|colwidth=25em|content=\n* [[Marcella Althaus-Reid]], [[Argentina]] \u2013 [[Scotland]] (1952\u20132009)\n* [[Paulo Evaristo Arns]], [[Brazil]] (1921\u20132016)\n* [[Rubem Alves]], [[Brazil]] (1933\u20132014)\n* [[Naim Ateek]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] (b. 1937)\n* [[Alan Boesak]], South Africa (b. 1945)\n* [[Leonardo Boff]], [[Brazil]] (b. 1938)\n* [[Robert McAfee Brown]], US (1920\u20132001)\n* [[H\u00e9lder C\u00e2mara]], [[Brazil]] (1909\u20131999), Archbishop of [[Olinda]] and [[Recife]]\n* [[Pedro Casald\u00e1liga]], Spain \u2013 [[Brazil]] (b. 1928)\n* [[Ernesto Cardenal]], [[Nicaragua]] (1925\u20132020)\n* [[Fernando Cardenal]], [[Nicaragua]] (1934\u20132016)\n* {{ill|Jos\u00e9 Severino Croatto|es||de}}, [[Argentina]] (1930\u20132004)\n* [[Miguel A.
