It is one of the most famous images of the [[French Revolution]]. David was the leading French painter, as well as a [[The Mountain|Montagnard]] and a member of the revolutionary [[Committee of General Security]]. The painting shows the radical journalist lying dead in his bath on July 13, 1793, after his murder by [[Charlotte Corday]]. Painted in the months after Marat's murder, it has been described by [[T. J. Clark (art historian)|T. J. Clark]] as the first modernist painting, for \"the way it took the stuff of politics as its material, and did not transmute it\".\n\n==The murder==\n[[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]] (24 May 1743 \u2013 13 July 1793) was one of the leaders of the Montagnards, the radical faction ascendant in French politics during the [[Reign of Terror]] until the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]. [[Charlotte Corday]] was a [[Girondin]] from a minor aristocratic family and a political enemy of Marat who blamed him for the [[September Massacre]]. She gained entrance to Marat's rooms with a note promising details of a counter-revolutionary ring in Caen.\n\nMarat suffered from a skin condition that caused him to spend much of his time in his bathtub; he would often work there. Corday fatally stabbed Marat, but she did not attempt to flee. She was later tried and executed for the murder.\n\n==David's politics ==\nAs well as being the leading French painter of his generation, David was a prominent Montagnard, and a [[Jacobin]], aligned with Marat and [[Maximilian Robespierre]]. A deputy of the Museum section at the [[National Convention|Convention]], he voted for the death of the King, and served on the Committee of General Security, where he actively participated in the sentencing and imprisonment of many and eventually presided over the \"section des interrogatoires\". He was also on the [[Committee of Public Instruction]].<ref>Wildenstein, pp. 43\u201359.</ref>\n\n== Style==\n[[File:Death of Marat by David (detail).jpg|thumb|Detail of ''The Death of Marat'' showing the paper held in Marat's left hand.

Some of the copies (the exact number of those completed remains uncertain) made by David's pupils (among them, [[Gioacchino Giuseppe Serangeli]] and G\u00e9rard) survived, notably visible in the museums of Dijon, Reims, and Versailles. The original letter, with bloodstains and bath water marks still visible, has survived and is currently intact in the ownership of [[Robert Lindsay, 29th Earl of Crawford]].<ref>The Earl of Crawford has the largest collection of French revolutionary manuscripts in Scotland.</ref>\n\nOther artists have also depicted the death of Marat, sometimes long after the facts, whose works refer or not to David's masterpiece. Among these later works, the ''Charlotte Corday'' by [[Paul Jacques Aim\u00e9 Baudry]], painted in 1860, during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], when Marat's \"dark legend\" (the angry monster insatiably hungry for blood) was widely spread among educated people, depicts [[Charlotte Corday]] as a true heroine of France, a model of virtue for the younger generations. The versions of Picasso and Munch are less trying to refer to the original context in itself than to confront modern issues with those of David, in terms of style. Brazilian artist [[Vik Muniz]] created a version composed of contents from a city landfill as part of his \"Pictures of Garbage\" series.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |title=A Modern Marat |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703440004575548581385394008 |date=October 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}\n* In 1897, the French director [[Georges Hatot]] made a movie entitled ''La Mort de Marat''.
