Reportedly, Qureshi walked up to a booth with the sign \"Got Questions? We've got answers,\" picked up a brochure on Islam and asked a question, as the booth's sign invited anyone to do. As Qureshi was engaged in conversation, a Muslim man walked by, snatched the brochure out of Qureshi's hand, and approached security personnel with it.

After completing his medical degree, Qureshi decided to spend his life studying and preaching the Christian Gospel and became a speaker for the [[Ravi Zacharias]] International Ministries. He subsequently completed three more master's degrees in theology and religious studies and was pursuing doctoral studies at the University of Oxford at the time of his death.\n\nQureshi lectured to students at more than 100 universities, including Oxford, Columbia, Dartmouth, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Hong Kong. He has participated in 18 moderated, public debates around North America, Europe, and Asia. In 2015, Qureshi debated at Wayne State University with Muslim scholar [[Shabir Ally]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Ravi Zacharias International Ministries|title=What is God Really Like: Tawhid or Trinity?

In 2009, Qureshi, and other members of Acts 17 Apologetics were kicked out of the fair on the pretense that they were passing out Christian literature. Reportedly, Qureshi walked up to a booth with the sign \"Got Questions? We've got answers,\" picked up a brochure on Islam and asked a question, as the booth's sign invited anyone to do. As Qureshi was engaged in conversation, a Muslim man walked by, snatched the brochure out of Qureshi's hand, and approached security personnel with it. Security personnel used this to create a confrontation with Qureshi and his colleagues, telling them to leave without telling them why, and ultimately assaulting them.<ref>{{Citation|last=Acts17Apologetics|title=Arab Fest 2009: The Unedited Footage|date=2009-06-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLDck9RzLpo|accessdate=2017-10-04}}</ref> Returning in 2010, Qureshi and his colleagues resolved not to engage anyone in conversation unless it was initiated by someone else. Furthermore, the members of Acts 17 Apologetics filmed the entirety of their interactions, as they had done the previous year. During the 2010 Festival, Qureshi was shown being asked questions by a small crowd of Muslim teenagers. Police officers soon<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0relDfMQ4xQ</ref> arrested the group and confiscated their video cameras, charging Qureshi with disturbing the peace and refusing a lawful order from a police officer.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= Nabeel Qureshi, David Wood, Paul Rezkalla|date= June 19, 2010 |title= Dearborn Arrests (Unedited Video Footage, by Request)medium= YouTube video|language= English |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkfVAeG3rn4 |access-date= August 14, 2016|location= Dearborn, Michicgan |publisher= Acts 17 Apologetics}}</ref><ref>{{Citation| title = Four Christians arrested outside Arab festival | publisher = Christian Examiner | url = http://www.christianexaminer.com/article/four-christians-arrested-outside-arab-festival/42372.htm | access-date = Sep 1, 2016}}</ref> Qureshi and his group spent a night in jail for this arrest.\n\nSoon after the arrest, Dearborn mayor [[John B. O'Reilly, Jr.]] released a statement indicating that the missionaries were engaged in hostile, angry shouts with the crowd, blocking access to the booths. The mayor stated that Qureshi was getting violent and confrontational with police officers attempting to peacefully calm the situation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jo|first1=Mary|title=The Mayor of Dearborn Responds|url=http://confidentchristianity.com/?p=193|website=Confident Christianity|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref><!-- The Mayor's original statement is linked via a PDF from this article.

At Knox Presbyterian Church in Toronto on March 18, 2016, Qureshi made a more nuanced assessment that although about a century ago some Muslim clerics agreed that the more violent passages of the Quran are not to be followed and some clerics had recently reiterated this view, Qureshi feared that this interpretation was going to be lost on many young Muslims who had been persuaded by terrorists that the plain language of violence in some Muslim texts should be taken literally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X__BEjwrga8|title=Nabeel Qureshi-Answering Jihad: A Better Way Forward|date=2016-08-04|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=2019-07-14}}</ref>\n\n== Cancer Diagnosis and Death ==\nOn 30 August 2016, Qureshi announced that he was in the advanced stages of stomach cancer.
