They are also found on the [[Malay Peninsula]] and are native to [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Myanmar]], [[Laos]], [[Nepal]], and [[Thailand]].\n\nThese cobras can adapt to a range of habitats, from natural to [[anthropogenical]]ly impacted environments. They prefer habitats associated with water, such as [[paddy field]]s, [[swamp]]s, and [[mangrove]]s, but can also be found in grasslands, shrublands, and forests. The species also occurs in agricultural land and human settlements including cities. They can be found at elevations of up to {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.<ref name=iucn/>\n\n==Ecology and behaviour==\nMonocled cobras are terrestrial and most active at dusk. In rice-growing areas, they hide in [[rodent]] burrows in the dykes between fields and have become semi-aquatic in this type of habitat. Juveniles feed mostly on [[amphibian]]s whereas adults prey on small [[mammal]]s, snakes and fish. When disturbed they prefer to take flight.<ref name=\"w\u00fcster98\" /> However, when threatened they will raise the anterior portions of their bodies, spread their hood, usually hiss loudly, and strike in an attempt to bite and defend themselves.<ref name=\"chanhome11\" />\n\nThey are often found in tree holes and areas where rodents are plentiful.<ref name=wch>{{cite web|title=Naja kaouthia: General Details and Information|url=http://www.toxinology.com/fusebox.cfm?fuseaction=main.snakes.display&id=SN0040|work=WCH Clinical Toxinology Resource|publisher=University of Adelaide|accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome populations of the monocled cobra have the ability to spit venom.<ref>{{Cite journal| title= Dentitional phenomena in cobra revisited: spitting and fang structure in the Asiatic species of Naja (Serpentes: Elapidae)| author1=Wuster, Wolfgang| author2=Thorpe, Roger S.| year=1992| journal=Herpetologica| volume=48| issue=4| pages=424\u2013434| url= http://pages.bangor.ac.uk/~bss024/pdfs/1992/Wuster%20Herp%201992%20spitters.pdf}}</ref><ref>Santra, Vishal & Wolfgang W\u00fcster (2017) Naja kaouthia behavior/spitting.
