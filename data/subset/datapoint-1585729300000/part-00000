Eyelash reflex disappear but other reflexes remain intact and coughing, vomiting and struggling may occur; respiration can be irregular with breath-holding.\n\n'''Stage III''' (stage of surgical anesthesia): from onset of automatic respiration to respiratory paralysis. It is divided into four planes: \n*''Plane I'' - from onset of automatic respiration to cessation of eyeball movements. Eyelid reflex is lost, swallowing reflex disappears, marked eyeball movement may occur but conjunctival reflex is lost at the bottom of the plane\n*''Plane II'' - from cessation of eyeball movements to beginning of paralysis of intercostal muscles. Laryngeal reflex is lost although inflammation of the upper respiratory tract increases reflex irritability, corneal reflex disappears, [[lacrimation|secretion of tears]] increases (a useful sign of light anesthesia), respiration is automatic and regular, movement and deep breathing as a response to skin stimulation disappears.\n*''Plane III'' - from beginning to completion of intercostal muscle paralysis. Diaphragmatic respiration persists but there is progressive intercostal paralysis, pupils dilated and light reflex is abolished. The laryngeal reflex lost in plane II can still be initiated by painful stimuli arising from the dilatation of anus or cervix. This was the desired plane for surgery when [[muscle relaxant]]s were not used.\n*''Plane IV'' - from complete intercostal paralysis to diaphragmatic paralysis ([[apnea]]).\n\n'''Stage IV''': from [[respiratory arrest|stoppage of respiration]] till death. Anesthetic overdose-caused medullary paralysis with respiratory arrest and vasomotor collapse. Pupils are widely dilated and muscles are relaxed.\n\nIn 1954, [[Joseph F.
