Early in his career, he became the [[assistant mangaka|assistant]] to [[Tamakichi Sakura]] on ''{{Nihongo|The Form of Happiness|\u3057\u3042\u308f\u305b\u306e\u304b\u305f\u3061|Shiawase no Katachi}}'' as {{Nihongo|''Turtle-san''|\u30ab\u30e1\u3055\u3093|Kame-san}} in 1992 and [[K\u014dji Kiriyama]] (''[[Ninku]]''). At that time, he also submitted his first [[yomikiri]] Dragdoll Group to the [[Tezuka Award]] but was rejected. In 1994, Takei submitted his short story ''Anna the Itako'' to the 48th Tezuka Award and won the honorable mention. He was later introduced to [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]] and became his assistant along with [[Eiichiro Oda]] on ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]''. \n\nTakei published his short story ''Death Zero'' in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' winter special and ''[[Butsu Zone]]'' in the summer special of 1996. A reworked version of ''[[Butsu Zone]]'' became his first manga series published in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' of 1997. Takei's longest-running series, ''[[Shaman King]]'' began serialization in Shueisha's ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' in 1998, though was forced to conclude in 2004. In 2007, Takei returned three years after the conclusion of ''Shaman King'' with a new ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' series; ''[[Jumbor Barutronica]]''. Set in the distant future, construction workers pilot [[mecha]]. One of them is killed and his memories are implanted in his clone, a thirty-year-old man in a five-year-old superpowered construction tool body. The series was canceled after ten issues and released in one volume. \n\nDuring the [[Jump Festa]] 2008, Shueisha announced a [[kanzenban]] reprint of ''Shaman King''. This release reprinted the entire series in 27 volumes complete with new covers while concluding the never-before-published \"true ending.\" On March 4, 2008, Japanese publisher [[Sh\u016beisha]] announced that Takei would be collaborating on ''[[Karakuri D\u00f4ji Ultimo]]'' with American comic creator [[Stan Lee]].
