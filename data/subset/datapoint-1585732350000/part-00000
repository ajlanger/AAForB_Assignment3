By May there was also a winter-wheat crop of 560 million bushels ready for harvest in the Mississippi Valley. This oversupply caused a drop in wheat prices so heavy that the net incomes of the farming population from wheat were threatened with extinction.

In June 1929, the position was saved by a severe drought in the Dakotas and the Canadian West, plus unfavorable seed times in Argentina and eastern Australia. The oversupply was now wanted to fill the gaps in the 1929 world wheat production. From 97\u00a2 per bushel in May, the price of wheat rose to $1.49 in July.

Many businesses failed (28,285 failures and a daily rate of 133 in 1931).\n\nThe 1929 crash brought the [[Roaring Twenties]] to a halt.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4795052.ece \"Kaboom!...and bust.

Only 16% of American households were invested in the stock market within the United States during the period leading up to this depression, suggesting that the crash carried somewhat less of a weight in causing it.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n[[File:UnemployedMarch.jpg|thumb|upright|Unemployed men march in [[Toronto]]]]\nHowever, the psychological effects of the crash reverberated across the nation as businesses became aware of the difficulties in securing capital market investments for new projects and expansions. Business uncertainty naturally affects job security for employees, and as the American worker (the consumer) faced uncertainty with regards to income, naturally the propensity to consume declined. The decline in stock prices caused [[bankruptcies]] and severe [[macroeconomic]] difficulties, including contraction of credit, business closures, firing of workers, bank failures, decline of the money supply, and other economically depressing events.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe resultant rise of mass unemployment is seen as a result of the crash, although the crash is by no means the sole event that contributed to the depression. The Wall Street Crash is usually seen as having the greatest impact on the events that followed and therefore is widely regarded as signaling the downward economic slide that initiated the Great Depression. True or not, the consequences were dire for almost everybody. Most academic experts agree on one aspect of the crash: It wiped out billions of dollars of wealth in one day, and this immediately depressed consumer buying.<ref name=\"nytimes2\" />\n\nThe failure set off a worldwide run on US gold deposits (i.e. the dollar), and forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates into the slump. Some 4,000 banks and other lenders ultimately failed. Also, the [[uptick rule]],<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0e317d72-86ac-11dd-959e-0000779fd18c.html \"Practice has plenty of historical precedents\"] ''Financial Times''</ref> which allowed short selling only when the last tick in a stock's price was positive, was implemented after the 1929 market crash to prevent short sellers from driving the price of a stock down in a [[bear raid]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0362e760-8b24-11dd-b634-0000779fd18c,s01=1.html \"Funds want 'uptick' rule back\"] ''Financial Times''</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\nThe stock market crash of October 1929 led directly to the Great Depression in Europe. When stocks plummeted on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], the world noticed immediately. Although financial leaders in the United Kingdom, as in the United States, vastly underestimated the extent of the crisis that ensued, it soon became clear that the world's economies were more interconnected than ever. The effects of the disruption to the global system of financing, trade, and production and the subsequent meltdown of the [[Economy of the United States|American economy]] were soon felt throughout Europe.<ref name=VT>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhr.history.vt.edu/modules/eu/mod04_depression/context.html|title=Digital History Reader \u2013 European History \u2013 Module 04: The End of Optimism? The Great Depression in Europe|publisher=[[Virginia Tech]]|access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1930 and 1931, in particular, unemployed workers went on strike, demonstrated in public, and otherwise took direct action to call public attention to their plight. Within the UK, protests often focused on the so-called [[Means Test]], which the government had instituted in 1931 to limit the amount of unemployment payments made to individuals and families. For working people, the Means Test seemed an intrusive and insensitive way to deal with the chronic and relentless deprivation caused by the economic crisis. The strikes were met forcefully, with police breaking up protests, arresting demonstrators, and charging them with crimes related to the violation of public order.<ref name=VT />\n\n==Academic debate==\nThere is ongoing debate among economists and historians as to what role the crash played in subsequent economic, social, and political events. ''[[The Economist]]'' argued in a 1998 article that the Depression did not start with the stock market crash,<ref>[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TGVSDT \"Economics focus: The Great Depression\"], ''The Economist'' (September 17, 1998)</ref> nor was it clear at the time of the crash that a depression was starting. They asked, \"Can a very serious Stock Exchange collapse produce a serious setback to industry when industrial production is for the most part in a healthy and balanced condition?\" They argued that there must be some setback, but there was not yet sufficient evidence to prove that it would be long or would necessarily produce a general industrial depression.<ref name=\"Nov1929\">[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12327393 \"Reactions of the Wall Street slump\"], ''The Economist'' (November 23, 1929)</ref>\n\nHowever, ''The Economist'' also cautioned that some bank failures were also to be expected and some banks may not have had any reserves left for financing commercial and industrial enterprises. It concluded that the position of the banks was the key to the situation, but what was going to happen could not have been foreseen.<ref name=\"Nov1929\" />\n\nSome academics view the Wall Street Crash of 1929 as part of a historical process that was a part of the new theories of [[boom and bust]]. According to economists such as [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Nikolai Kondratiev]] and [[Charles E. Mitchell]], the crash was merely a historical event in the continuing process known as [[Business cycle|economic cycles]]. The impact of the crash was merely to increase the speed at which the cycle proceeded to its next level.\n\n[[Milton Friedman]]'s ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', co-written with [[Anna Schwartz]], argues that what made the \"great contraction\" so severe was not the downturn in the business cycle, [[protectionism]], or the 1929 stock market crash in themselves but the collapse of the banking system during three waves of panics from 1930 to 1933.<ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/may/12/panic-control/ \"Panic control\"] ''The Washington Times''</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Causes of the Great Depression]]\n* [[Criticism of the Federal Reserve]] \n* [[Great Contraction]]\n* [[List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Axon, Gordon V.

By May there was also a winter-wheat crop of 560 million bushels ready for harvest in the Mississippi Valley. This oversupply caused a drop in wheat prices so heavy that the net incomes of the farming population from wheat were threatened with extinction. Stock markets are always sensitive to the future state of commodity markets {{citation needed|date=January 2019}}, and the slump in Wall Street predicted for May by Sir [[George Paish]] arrived on time. In June 1929, the position was saved by a severe drought in the Dakotas and the Canadian West, plus unfavorable seed times in Argentina and eastern Australia. The oversupply was now wanted to fill the gaps in the 1929 world wheat production. From 97\u00a2 per bushel in May, the price of wheat rose to $1.49 in July. When it was seen that at this figure American farmers would get more for their crop than for that of 1928, stocks went up again.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn August, the wheat price fell when France and Italy were bragging of a magnificent harvest, and the situation in Australia improved. That sent a shiver through Wall Street and stock prices quickly dropped, but word of cheap stocks brought a fresh rush of \"stags\", amateur speculators and investors. Congress voted for a $100 million relief package for the farmers, hoping to stabilize wheat prices. By October though, the price had fallen to $1.31 per bushel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21480897|title=Grain Plunges|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|location=Brisbane, Qld|date=October 26, 1929|accessdate=November 22, 2012|page=19|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nOther important economic barometers were also slowing or even falling by mid-1929, including car sales, house sales, and steel production. The falling commodity and industrial production may have dented even American self-confidence, and the stock market peaked on September 3 at 381.17 just after Labor Day, then started to falter after [[Roger Babson]] issued his prescient \"market crash\" forecast. By the end of September, the market was down 10% from the peak (the \"Babson Break\"). Selling intensified in early and mid October, with sharp down days punctuated by a few up days.

Only 16% of American households were invested in the stock market within the United States during the period leading up to this depression, suggesting that the crash carried somewhat less of a weight in causing it.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n[[File:UnemployedMarch.jpg|thumb|upright|Unemployed men march in [[Toronto]]]]\nHowever, the psychological effects of the crash reverberated across the nation as businesses became aware of the difficulties in securing capital market investments for new projects and expansions. Business uncertainty naturally affects job security for employees, and as the American worker (the consumer) faced uncertainty with regards to income, naturally the propensity to consume declined. The decline in stock prices caused [[bankruptcies]] and severe [[macroeconomic]] difficulties, including contraction of credit, business closures, firing of workers, bank failures, decline of the money supply, and other economically depressing events.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe resultant rise of mass unemployment is seen as a result of the crash, although the crash is by no means the sole event that contributed to the depression. The Wall Street Crash is usually seen as having the greatest impact on the events that followed and therefore is widely regarded as signaling the downward economic slide that initiated the Great Depression. True or not, the consequences were dire for almost everybody. Most academic experts agree on one aspect of the crash: It wiped out billions of dollars of wealth in one day, and this immediately depressed consumer buying.<ref name=\"nytimes2\" />\n\nThe failure set off a worldwide run on US gold deposits (i.e. the dollar), and forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates into the slump. Some 4,000 banks and other lenders ultimately failed. Also, the [[uptick rule]],<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0e317d72-86ac-11dd-959e-0000779fd18c.html \"Practice has plenty of historical precedents\"] ''Financial Times''</ref> which allowed short selling only when the last tick in a stock's price was positive, was implemented after the 1929 market crash to prevent short sellers from driving the price of a stock down in a [[bear raid]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0362e760-8b24-11dd-b634-0000779fd18c,s01=1.html \"Funds want 'uptick' rule back\"] ''Financial Times''</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\nThe stock market crash of October 1929 led directly to the Great Depression in Europe. When stocks plummeted on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], the world noticed immediately. Although financial leaders in the United Kingdom, as in the United States, vastly underestimated the extent of the crisis that ensued, it soon became clear that the world's economies were more interconnected than ever. The effects of the disruption to the global system of financing, trade, and production and the subsequent meltdown of the [[Economy of the United States|American economy]] were soon felt throughout Europe.<ref name=VT>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhr.history.vt.edu/modules/eu/mod04_depression/context.html|title=Digital History Reader \u2013 European History \u2013 Module 04: The End of Optimism?

Within the UK, protests often focused on the so-called [[Means Test]], which the government had instituted in 1931 to limit the amount of unemployment payments made to individuals and families. For working people, the Means Test seemed an intrusive and insensitive way to deal with the chronic and relentless deprivation caused by the economic crisis. The strikes were met forcefully, with police breaking up protests, arresting demonstrators, and charging them with crimes related to the violation of public order.<ref name=VT />\n\n==Academic debate==\nThere is ongoing debate among economists and historians as to what role the crash played in subsequent economic, social, and political events. ''[[The Economist]]'' argued in a 1998 article that the Depression did not start with the stock market crash,<ref>[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TGVSDT \"Economics focus: The Great Depression\"], ''The Economist'' (September 17, 1998)</ref> nor was it clear at the time of the crash that a depression was starting. They asked, \"Can a very serious Stock Exchange collapse produce a serious setback to industry when industrial production is for the most part in a healthy and balanced condition?\" They argued that there must be some setback, but there was not yet sufficient evidence to prove that it would be long or would necessarily produce a general industrial depression.<ref name=\"Nov1929\">[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12327393 \"Reactions of the Wall Street slump\"], ''The Economist'' (November 23, 1929)</ref>\n\nHowever, ''The Economist'' also cautioned that some bank failures were also to be expected and some banks may not have had any reserves left for financing commercial and industrial enterprises. It concluded that the position of the banks was the key to the situation, but what was going to happen could not have been foreseen.<ref name=\"Nov1929\" />\n\nSome academics view the Wall Street Crash of 1929 as part of a historical process that was a part of the new theories of [[boom and bust]]. According to economists such as [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Nikolai Kondratiev]] and [[Charles E. Mitchell]], the crash was merely a historical event in the continuing process known as [[Business cycle|economic cycles]]. The impact of the crash was merely to increase the speed at which the cycle proceeded to its next level.\n\n[[Milton Friedman]]'s ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', co-written with [[Anna Schwartz]], argues that what made the \"great contraction\" so severe was not the downturn in the business cycle, [[protectionism]], or the 1929 stock market crash in themselves but the collapse of the banking system during three waves of panics from 1930 to 1933.<ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/may/12/panic-control/ \"Panic control\"] ''The Washington Times''</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Causes of the Great Depression]]\n* [[Criticism of the Federal Reserve]] \n* [[Great Contraction]]\n* [[List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Axon, Gordon V.
