It was released on April 15, 2008. The CD includes reworked versions of \"Leader\" and \"Geronimo\", both of which appeared on the ''Limited Edition Tour EP'', as well as a reworked version of \"Do the Panic\", which originally appeared on the band's 'bootleg' fanclub CD ''[[Phantom Planet: Negatives]]''.\n\nEarly on in the recording process Phantom Planet's contract with Epic Records expired, which left them searching for a new record label. Soon after this, they signed to Fueled by Ramen, which produces bands such as Fall Out Boy, Paramore, Panic at the Disco, The Hush Sound and The Academy Is....\n\nOn January 20, 2008, Phantom Planet posted a bulletin on their Myspace page to announce that the official release date would be April 15, 2008. Fueled By Ramen re-released a teaser trailer and stated that the first single from the album will be a reworking of \"Do the Panic\".\n\nIn an interview with RaggedMag, vocalist Alex Greenwald explained that \"all bands are kind of their own cult, you know, but we want to take it to a new level. We really like the show ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]'', and even though it's totally fiction, there's this air of mystery that's lacking in a lot entertainment these days. I really like mystery in things, and what a little bit of enigma brings out of people and their imaginations...a band is about community, and within itself it is a brotherhood; it's companionship. But a band can't be anything without the people to love it.
