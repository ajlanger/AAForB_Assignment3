Familiar examples might include [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lilies]], [[Frog|frogs]], [[Turtle|turtles]], and [[Heron|herons]]. Often, the entire margin of the pond is fringed by [[wetland]], and these wetlands support the aquatic [[food web]], provide shelter for wildlife, and stabilize the shore of the pond. Some grazing animals like [[Goose|geese]] and [[Muskrat|muskrats]] consume the wetland plants directly as a source of food.  In many other cases, however, the pond plants fall into the water and [[Decomposition|decay]]. Many invertebrates then feed on the decaying plants, and these invertebrates provide food for wetland species including fish, [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]], and herons. The open water may allow [[algae]] to grow, and these algae may support yet another food web that includes aquatic insects and [[Minnow|minnows]]. A pond, therefore, may have combinations of three different food webs, one based on larger plants, one based upon decayed plants, and one based upon algae. Hence, ponds often have many different animal species using the wide array of food sources. They, therefore, provide an important source of [[biological diversity]] in landscapes.\n\n[[Vernal pond]]s are ponds which dry up for part of the year. They are so called because they are typically at their peak depth in the spring (the meaning of \"vernal\" comes form the Latin word for [[Spring (season)|spring]]). Naturally occurring vernal ponds do not usually have fish.  The absence of fish is a very important characteristic since it provides amphibians with breeding locations free from [[predation]] by fish. Hence, introducing fish to a pond can have seriously detrimental consequences. In some parts of the world, such as California, the vernal ponds have rare and endangered plant species. On the coastal plain, they provide habitat for endangered frogs such as the [[Mississippi Gopher Frog]].<ref name=keddy />\n\n==Conservation and management==\n[[File:Niagara Falls Garden 2005.JPG|thumb|left|Formal [[rock garden]] pond with [[waterfall]]]]\nPonds, being small, are easily disrupted by human activity, such as hikers. Drainage of ponds is a frequent problem in agricultural areas, such as in the prairie potholes of North America. Although ponds are a useful source of water for cattle, [[overgrazing]] and wading can turn a pond into a muddy hole.  Nutrient sources such as fertilized pastures, human sewage, and even lawn [[fertilizer]] can cause explosive growth of algae and the loss of rooted plants and many other aquatic species.  Roads near ponds can kill large numbers of amphibians and turtles that may migrate to and from the pond as part of their annual breeding cycle. Many well-intentioned people introduce fish to ponds, being unaware that some species may eat aquatic plants, stir up sediment, and eat the young of amphibians and many other invertebrate species. The gentle slope of land into ponds also provides an expanse of habitat for wetland plants and wet meadows.  The construction of retaining walls, or lawns, can severely degrade the life in a pond.\n\nIn landscapes where ponds are artificially constructed, they are done so to provide wildlife viewing opportunities, to treat wastewater, or for aesthetic purposes, such as part of a golf course. The design of a pond determines how productive it will be for wildlife.  In general, gently sloping shorelines with broad expanses of wetland plants not only provide the best conditions for wildlife, but they help protect water quality from sources in the surrounding landscapes. It is also beneficial to allow water levels to fall each year during drier periods. Roads and houses should be kept as far away as possible.<ref>{{cite book |author=Canadian Wildlife Service |title=How Much Habitat is Enough? A Framework for Guiding Habitat Rehabilitation in Great Lakes Areas of Concern |edition=2nd |year=2004 |publisher=Canadian Wildlife Service |isbn=978-0662265771 }}</ref>\n\nAnother important way to add ponds back into landscapes is to restore rivers so that they can flood and meander to create large numbers of natural ponds, including vernal pools and wetlands, in river valleys.<ref>{{cite book |author=K.

In earlier times, ponds were artificial and utilitarian; as [[stew pond]]s, [[mill pond]]s and so on. The significance of this feature seems, in some cases, to have been lost when the word was carried abroad with emigrants. In the United States, natural pools are often called ponds.  Ponds for a specific purpose keep the adjective, such as \"stock pond\", used for watering livestock.\n\n''Pond'' usually implies a quite small body of water, generally smaller than one would require a boat to cross. Another definition is that a pond is a body of water where even its deepest areas are reached by sunlight or where a human can walk across the entire body of water without being submerged. In some dialects of English, pond normally refers to small artificially created bodies of water.\n\nSome regions of the United States define a pond as a body of water with a surface area of less than {{convert|10|acre|ha}}.  [[Minnesota]], known as the 'land of 10,000 lakes' is commonly said to distinguish lakes from ponds, bogs and other water features by this definition,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/faq/mnfacts/water.html |title=Lakes, rivers, and wetlands facts |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref> but also says that a lake is distinguished primarily by wave action reaching the shore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakes/faqs.html#lake_definition |title=Frequently asked questions about lakes |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter December 2007 with Pond.jpg|thumb|Pond in winter]]\n\nThe term is also used for temporary accumulation of water from [[surface runoff]] (''ponded'' water).\n\nThere are various regional names for naturally occurring ponds. In Scotland, one of the terms is [[loch]]an, which may also apply to a large body of water such as a lake. In North American prairies, they may be termed [[Dry lake|playas]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Loren M. Smith |title=Playas of the Great Plains |year=2003 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0292743687 }}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nPonds are used for the provision of fish and other wildlife including [[waterfowl]], which is a source of food for humans.  [[Pollution|Pollutants]] entering ponds are often substantially mitigated by the natural [[sedimentation]] and biological activities within the water body. Ponds are also a major contributor to local [[ecosystem]] richness and diversity for both plants and animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/infd-8agmdg|title=Freshwater ecosystems:publisher=Forest Research|access-date=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Hindu]] temples usually have a pond nearby so that pilgrims can take [[Bathing#Purpose|baths]]. These ponds are considered sacred.\n\nIn [[medieval]] times in [[Europe]], it was typical for many [[monastery]] and [[castle]]s (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have [[fish pond]]s. These are still common in Europe and in [[East Asia]] (notably Japan), where [[koi]] may be kept.\n\n[[Stabilization pond|Waste stabilization ponds]] are used as a low-cost method for [[wastewater treatment]].\n\nIn agriculture, [[Treatment pond|treatment ponds]] may reduce nutrients released downstream from the pond. They may also provide [[irrigation]] [[reservoir]]s at times of drought.\n\n[[File:Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico de Quito, cool stone bridge.

In earlier times, ponds were artificial and utilitarian; as [[stew pond]]s, [[mill pond]]s and so on. The significance of this feature seems, in some cases, to have been lost when the word was carried abroad with emigrants. In the United States, natural pools are often called ponds.  Ponds for a specific purpose keep the adjective, such as \"stock pond\", used for watering livestock.\n\n''Pond'' usually implies a quite small body of water, generally smaller than one would require a boat to cross. Another definition is that a pond is a body of water where even its deepest areas are reached by sunlight or where a human can walk across the entire body of water without being submerged. In some dialects of English, pond normally refers to small artificially created bodies of water.\n\nSome regions of the United States define a pond as a body of water with a surface area of less than {{convert|10|acre|ha}}.  [[Minnesota]], known as the 'land of 10,000 lakes' is commonly said to distinguish lakes from ponds, bogs and other water features by this definition,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/faq/mnfacts/water.html |title=Lakes, rivers, and wetlands facts |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref> but also says that a lake is distinguished primarily by wave action reaching the shore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakes/faqs.html#lake_definition |title=Frequently asked questions about lakes |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter December 2007 with Pond.jpg|thumb|Pond in winter]]\n\nThe term is also used for temporary accumulation of water from [[surface runoff]] (''ponded'' water).\n\nThere are various regional names for naturally occurring ponds. In Scotland, one of the terms is [[loch]]an, which may also apply to a large body of water such as a lake. In North American prairies, they may be termed [[Dry lake|playas]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Loren M. Smith |title=Playas of the Great Plains |year=2003 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0292743687 }}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nPonds are used for the provision of fish and other wildlife including [[waterfowl]], which is a source of food for humans.  [[Pollution|Pollutants]] entering ponds are often substantially mitigated by the natural [[sedimentation]] and biological activities within the water body. Ponds are also a major contributor to local [[ecosystem]] richness and diversity for both plants and animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/infd-8agmdg|title=Freshwater ecosystems:publisher=Forest Research|access-date=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Hindu]] temples usually have a pond nearby so that pilgrims can take [[Bathing#Purpose|baths]]. These ponds are considered sacred.\n\nIn [[medieval]] times in [[Europe]], it was typical for many [[monastery]] and [[castle]]s (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have [[fish pond]]s. These are still common in Europe and in [[East Asia]] (notably Japan), where [[koi]] may be kept.\n\n[[Stabilization pond|Waste stabilization ponds]] are used as a low-cost method for [[wastewater treatment]].\n\nIn agriculture, [[Treatment pond|treatment ponds]] may reduce nutrients released downstream from the pond. They may also provide [[irrigation]] [[reservoir]]s at times of drought.\n\n[[File:Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico de Quito, cool stone bridge.
