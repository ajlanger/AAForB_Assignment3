The programme originated from a one-off drama, ''[[Woodentop (The Bill)|Woodentop]]'', broadcast in August 1983.\n\nThe programme focused on the lives and work of one shift of [[police officer]]s, rather than on any particular aspect of police work. ''The Bill'' was the longest-running [[police procedural]] television series in the [[United Kingdom]], and among the longest running of any British television series at the time of its cancellation. The title originates from \"Old Bill\", a [[List of police-related slang terms|slang term for the police]].\n\nAlthough highly acclaimed by fans and critics, the series attracted controversy on several occasions. An episode broadcast in 2008 was criticised for featuring fictional treatment for [[multiple sclerosis]]. The series has also faced more general criticism concerning its levels of violence, particularly prior to 2009, when it occupied a [[watershed (television)|pre-watershed]] slot. ''The Bill'' won [[List of Awards of The Bill|several awards]], including [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]s, a [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] award, and Best Drama at the [[Inside Soap Awards#2009|Inside Soap Awards]] in 2009, this being the series' fourth consecutive win.\n\nThroughout its 26-year run, the programme was always broadcast on the main ITV network. In later years, episodes of the show were repeated on [[ITV3]] on their week of broadcast. The series has also been repeated on other digital stations, including [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]], [[Alibi (TV channel)|Alibi]], [[Watch (TV channel)|Watch]], [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]], and [[Drama (British TV channel)|Drama]]. In March 2010, executives at ITV announced that the network did not intend to recommission ''The Bill'' and that recording on the series would cease on 14 June 2010. The last episode aired on 31 August 2010.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of The Bill}}\n\n''The Bill'' was originally conceived by [[Geoff McQueen]] in 1983, then a new television writer, as a one-off [[Dramatic programming|drama]]. McQueen had originally titled the production ''Old Bill''.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> It was picked up by Michael Chapman for [[History of ITV#1968\u20131974|ITV franchise]] holder [[Thames Television]], who retitled it ''Woodentop'' as part of Thames's \"Storyboard\" series of one-off dramas and was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] under the title ''[[Woodentop (The Bill)|Woodentop]]'' on 16 August 1983.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> ''Woodentop'' starred [[Mark Wingett]] as [[Constable|PC]] [[Jim Carver]] and [[Trudie Goodwin]] as WPC [[June Ackland]] of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], both attached to the fictional [[Sun Hill police station]].<ref name=\"Tibballs\">{{cite book|last=Tibballs|first=Geoff|title=The Bill: The Official History of Sun Hill|publisher=Carlton|date=November 2003|page=10|chapter=Introduction|isbn=978-1-84442-667-6}}</ref>\n\nAlthough originally only intended as a one-off, ''Woodentop'' impressed ITV to the extent that a full series was commissioned, first broadcast on 16 October 1984 with one [[Watershed (television)|post-watershed]] episode per week, featuring an hour-long, separate storyline for each episode of the first three series. The first episode of the full series was \"Funny Ol' Business \u2013 Cops & Robbers\". With serialisation, the name of the show changed from ''Woodentop'' to ''The Bill''.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> Series one had 11 episodes and was broadcast in 1984, series two and three had 12 episodes each and were broadcast in 1985-6 and 1987 respectively. With a full ensemble cast to explore new characters not featured or just mentioned in ''Woodentop'', the focus of the storylines soon shifted away from new recruit Carver and towards [[Detective Inspector]] Roy Galloway and Sergeant Bob Cryer.\n\nThe series then changed to two episodes, each of 30 minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, per week in 1988 (from July 1988 onwards, the series also began being broadcast all year round without a summer break), increasing to three a week beginning in 1993, with the third episode being broadcast on Fridays. In 1998, ''The Bill'' returned to hour-long episodes, which later became twice-weekly,<ref name=\"BBC2003\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3227753.stm|title=The Bill prepares for live birthday|date=30 October 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818091509/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3227753.stm|archivedate=18 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> with the Friday episode being dropped, at which point the series adopted a much more serialised approach.

Many veteran characters were written out, leading to the [[Golden Opportunity (The Bill)|Sun Hill fire]] during 2002. Marquess stated that the clearout was necessary to introduce \"plausible, powerful new characters\". As part of the new serial format, much more of the characters' personal lives were explored, but, as Marquess put it, the viewers still \"don't go home with them\".<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> The change also allowed ''The Bill'' to become more reflective of modern policing, with the introduction of officers from ethnic minorities, most notably the new superintendent, [[Adam Okaro]]. It also allowed coverage of the relationship of homosexual Sergeant [[Craig Gilmore (The Bill)|Craig Gilmore]] and PC [[Luke Ashton]], a storyline which Marquess was determined to explore before rival ''[[Merseybeat (TV series)|Merseybeat]]''.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/>\n\nIn 2005, [[Johnathan Young]] took over as executive producer.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> The serial format was dropped and ''The Bill'' returned to stand-alone episodes with more focus on crime and policing than on the personal lives of the officers. 2007 saw the reintroduction of episode titles, which had been dropped in 2002.<ref name=\"changing times\"/> In 2009, ''The Bill'' moved back to the 9pm slot it previously held, and the theme tune, \"Overkill\", was replaced as part of a major overhaul of the series.<ref

This continued on from the broadcast order of episodes repeated on Alibi, carrying on from where the network had finished. As of April 2012, Watch had repeated every single episode from 28 February 2002 to 24 February 2005, and was to begin airing episodes from March 2005.

The programme originated from a one-off drama, ''[[Woodentop (The Bill)|Woodentop]]'', broadcast in August 1983.\n\nThe programme focused on the lives and work of one shift of [[police officer]]s, rather than on any particular aspect of police work. ''The Bill'' was the longest-running [[police procedural]] television series in the [[United Kingdom]], and among the longest running of any British television series at the time of its cancellation. The title originates from \"Old Bill\", a [[List of police-related slang terms|slang term for the police]].\n\nAlthough highly acclaimed by fans and critics, the series attracted controversy on several occasions. An episode broadcast in 2008 was criticised for featuring fictional treatment for [[multiple sclerosis]]. The series has also faced more general criticism concerning its levels of violence, particularly prior to 2009, when it occupied a [[watershed (television)|pre-watershed]] slot. ''The Bill'' won [[List of Awards of The Bill|several awards]], including [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]s, a [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] award, and Best Drama at the [[Inside Soap Awards#2009|Inside Soap Awards]] in 2009, this being the series' fourth consecutive win.\n\nThroughout its 26-year run, the programme was always broadcast on the main ITV network. In later years, episodes of the show were repeated on [[ITV3]] on their week of broadcast. The series has also been repeated on other digital stations, including [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]], [[Alibi (TV channel)|Alibi]], [[Watch (TV channel)|Watch]], [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]], and [[Drama (British TV channel)|Drama]]. In March 2010, executives at ITV announced that the network did not intend to recommission ''The Bill'' and that recording on the series would cease on 14 June 2010. The last episode aired on 31 August 2010.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of The Bill}}\n\n''The Bill'' was originally conceived by [[Geoff McQueen]] in 1983, then a new television writer, as a one-off [[Dramatic programming|drama]]. McQueen had originally titled the production ''Old Bill''.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> It was picked up by Michael Chapman for [[History of ITV#1968\u20131974|ITV franchise]] holder [[Thames Television]], who retitled it ''Woodentop'' as part of Thames's \"Storyboard\" series of one-off dramas and was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] under the title ''[[Woodentop (The Bill)|Woodentop]]'' on 16 August 1983.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> ''Woodentop'' starred [[Mark Wingett]] as [[Constable|PC]] [[Jim Carver]] and [[Trudie Goodwin]] as WPC [[June Ackland]] of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], both attached to the fictional [[Sun Hill police station]].<ref name=\"Tibballs\">{{cite book|last=Tibballs|first=Geoff|title=The Bill: The Official History of Sun Hill|publisher=Carlton|date=November 2003|page=10|chapter=Introduction|isbn=978-1-84442-667-6}}</ref>\n\nAlthough originally only intended as a one-off, ''Woodentop'' impressed ITV to the extent that a full series was commissioned, first broadcast on 16 October 1984 with one [[Watershed (television)|post-watershed]] episode per week, featuring an hour-long, separate storyline for each episode of the first three series. The first episode of the full series was \"Funny Ol' Business \u2013 Cops & Robbers\". With serialisation, the name of the show changed from ''Woodentop'' to ''The Bill''.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> Series one had 11 episodes and was broadcast in 1984, series two and three had 12 episodes each and were broadcast in 1985-6 and 1987 respectively. With a full ensemble cast to explore new characters not featured or just mentioned in ''Woodentop'', the focus of the storylines soon shifted away from new recruit Carver and towards [[Detective Inspector]] Roy Galloway and Sergeant Bob Cryer.\n\nThe series then changed to two episodes, each of 30 minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, per week in 1988 (from July 1988 onwards, the series also began being broadcast all year round without a summer break), increasing to three a week beginning in 1993, with the third episode being broadcast on Fridays. In 1998, ''The Bill'' returned to hour-long episodes, which later became twice-weekly,<ref name=\"BBC2003\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3227753.stm|title=The Bill prepares for live birthday|date=30 October 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818091509/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3227753.stm|archivedate=18 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> with the Friday episode being dropped, at which point the series adopted a much more serialised approach.

Many veteran characters were written out, leading to the [[Golden Opportunity (The Bill)|Sun Hill fire]] during 2002. Marquess stated that the clearout was necessary to introduce \"plausible, powerful new characters\". As part of the new serial format, much more of the characters' personal lives were explored, but, as Marquess put it, the viewers still \"don't go home with them\".<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> The change also allowed ''The Bill'' to become more reflective of modern policing, with the introduction of officers from ethnic minorities, most notably the new superintendent, [[Adam Okaro]]. It also allowed coverage of the relationship of homosexual Sergeant [[Craig Gilmore (The Bill)|Craig Gilmore]] and PC [[Luke Ashton]], a storyline which Marquess was determined to explore before rival ''[[Merseybeat (TV series)|Merseybeat]]''.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/>\n\nIn 2005, [[Johnathan Young]] took over as executive producer.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> The serial format was dropped and ''The Bill'' returned to stand-alone episodes with more focus on crime and policing than on the personal lives of the officers. 2007 saw the reintroduction of episode titles, which had been dropped in 2002.<ref name=\"changing times\"/> In 2009, ''The Bill'' moved back to the 9pm slot it previously held, and the theme tune, \"Overkill\", was replaced as part of a major overhaul of the series.<ref
