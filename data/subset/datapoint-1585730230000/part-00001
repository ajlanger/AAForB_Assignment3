are not enforced due to a lack of resources. Several New York City area nurses have expressed concerns that patients are not complying with self-quarantine guidelines due to financial necessity or fear of losing their jobs. A New York State Nurses Association board member has expressed concerns that low-income patients who share rooms with other individuals may not be able to effectively self-isolate at their residences.<ref>{{cite news|title=NYC nurses fear many coronavirus patients can't afford to self-quarantine|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-nurses-fear-patients-not-self-quarantining-20200324-rd5x2xa3gzc3nhmv3e36u5n3iu-story.html|date=March 24, 2020|work=Daily News}}</ref>\n\n=== Difficulties of implementation in Hasidic communities ===\nImplementing social distancing has been especially difficult in some communities dominated by [[Hasidic Jews]].

Zelenko, who must self-isolate since he is missing a lung, says in daily [[YouTube]] videos he posts that he has treated 500 patients (mostly in Kiryas Joel) for COVID-19, using the combination of [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[azithromycin]] or [[zinc sulfate]], which has in some trials yielded positive results in reducing symptoms. Zelenko claimed that 90 percent of the Hasidic community will become infected; the county's health commissioner and the village's emergency services department disputed that, pointing out that it was based on nine positive results out of 14 samples.<ref name=\"Forward article\" />\n===Police===\n\nAccording to New York City Police Commissioner [[Dermot F.

are not enforced due to a lack of resources. Several New York City area nurses have expressed concerns that patients are not complying with self-quarantine guidelines due to financial necessity or fear of losing their jobs. A New York State Nurses Association board member has expressed concerns that low-income patients who share rooms with other individuals may not be able to effectively self-isolate at their residences.<ref>{{cite news|title=NYC nurses fear many coronavirus patients can't afford to self-quarantine|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-nurses-fear-patients-not-self-quarantining-20200324-rd5x2xa3gzc3nhmv3e36u5n3iu-story.html|date=March 24, 2020|work=Daily News}}</ref>\n\n=== Difficulties of implementation in Hasidic communities ===\nImplementing social distancing has been especially difficult in some communities dominated by [[Hasidic Jews]].

Zelenko, who must self-isolate since he is missing a lung, says in daily [[YouTube]] videos he posts that he has treated 500 patients (mostly in Kiryas Joel) for COVID-19, using the combination of [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[azithromycin]] or [[zinc sulfate]], which has in some trials yielded positive results in reducing symptoms. Zelenko claimed that 90 percent of the Hasidic community will become infected; the county's health commissioner and the village's emergency services department disputed that, pointing out that it was based on nine positive results out of 14 samples.<ref name=\"Forward article\" />\n===Police===\n\nAccording to New York City Police Commissioner [[Dermot F.
