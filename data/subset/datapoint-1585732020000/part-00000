It is the fourth largest city in the state and is the administrative capital of [[Patiala district]]. Patiala is located around the ''[[Qila Mubarak, Patiala|Qila Mubarak]]'' (the 'Fortunate Castle') constructed by the [[Sidhu]] [[Jat]] chieftain [[Ala Singh]], who founded the royal dynasty of [[Patiala State]] in 1763, and after whom the city is named.\n\nIn popular culture, the city remains famous for its traditional ''[[Patiala Shahi Pagg|Patiala shahi]]'' [[turban]] (a type of headgear), ''paranda'' (a tasselled tag for braiding hair), ''Patiala salwar'' (a type of female trousers), ''[[jutti]]'' (a type of footwear) and [[Patiala peg]] (a measure of liquor).<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://patiala.nic.in/html/history.htm#introduction|title=History of Patiala|publisher=Official Website of District Patiala|accessdate=19 August 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907045829/http://patiala.nic.in/html/history.htm#introduction|archivedate=7 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n'Patiala' comes from the roots ''pati'' and ''ala'', the former is [[Urdu]] for a \"strip of land\" and ''<nowiki/>'ala''<nowiki/>' comes from the name of the founder of the city, Ala Singh. So, 'Patiala' can be translated into English to mean \u2018the land of Ala\u2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.totalpunjab.com/patiala/about-patiala/the-history-of-patiala/|title=The History of Patiala {{!}} Patiala|website=www.totalpunjab.com|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Patiala State}}\nPatiala state was established in 1763 by Ala Singh, who laid the foundation of the Patiala fort known as [[Qila Mubarak, Patiala|Qila Mubarak]], around 'which the present city of Patiala is built. After the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761 in which the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] were defeated by the [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]], the writ of the Afghans prevailed throughout Punjab. It is at this stage that the rulers of Patiala began to acquire ensigns of royalty. The Patiala state saw more than forty years of a ceaseless power struggle with the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]], [[Maratha Empire]] and the [[Sikh Empire]] of [[Lahore]].\n\nIn 1808, the Raja of Patiala entered into a treaty with the [[British Raj|British]] against [[Sikh]] ruler [[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]] of Lahore in 1808, thus becoming collaborator in the grand empire building process by the British in, the sub-continent of India. Patiala became a [[17-guns salute]] state during the [[British Raj]]. The rulers of Patiala such as Karam Singh, Narinder Singh, [[Mahendra Singh of Patiala|Mahendra Singh]], [[Rajinder Singh]], [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Bhupinder Singh]], and [[Yadavindra Singh|Yadvindra Singh]] were treated with respect and dignity by the British.\n\n[[File:PATIALA,QILLA MUBARAK.jpg|thumb|left|The Darshani Gate (the main gate of the [[Qila Mubarak, Patiala|Qila Mubarak]]), built in the 18th century. The city was built around the fort.]]\nThe city of Patiala was designed and developed according to a plan akin to that of [[Hindu temple architecture|temple architecture]], the first settlers of Patiala were the [[Punjabi Hindus|Hindus]] of Sirhind, who opened their business establishments outside the Darshani Gate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://patiala.gov.in/html/history.htm|title=History Of Patiala|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe royal house is now headed by [[Amarinder Singh|Captain Amarinder Singh]] who is also the current [[Chief Minister of Punjab (India)|Chief Minister of Punjab]]. The royals are considered cultural and political icons in east Punjab.\n\nMaharaja Karam Singh who ruled from 1813 to 1845 (the Sikh Kingdom of Patiala in Punjab) joined the British East India Company and helped the British during the First Anglo Sikh wars against the Sikh Empire of Maharajah Ranjit Singh of Punjab which was larger and extended from Tibet Kashmir, plains of Punjab to Peshawar near the Afghan borders.\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n\n===Kali Devi Mandir===\n[[File:Shri Kali Devi Patiala.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Murti]]'' of Maa kali at the [[Shri Kali Devi Temple, Patiala]]. The temple was commissioned by the Sikh ruler of Patiala, [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]] in 1936.]]\n[[Shri Kali Devi Temple, Patiala|Kali Devi Temple]] is a [[Hindu temple]] dedicated to [[Maa Kaali]]. The temple was built by the Sikh ruler of the Patiala State, [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]], who financed the building of the temple in his capital and oversaw its installation in 1936. Legend has it that the Maharaja built the temple to protect the city from flooding and performed annual sacrifice at the temple. Bhupinder Singh ruled the princely state of Patiala from 1900 to 1938. He brought the 6-ft statue of Divine Mother Kali and Paawan Jyoti from Bengal to Patiala and offered the first [[Animal sacrifice in Hinduism|Bali]] (sacrifice) of a water buffalo to the temple. Because of the temple's beautiful structure, it has been declared a national monument. This large complex attracts devotees, [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]], from distant places.\n\nA much older temple of Raj Rajeshwari is also situated in the centre of this complex. The temple is situated opposite the Baradari garden at Mall Road. Devotees offer mustard oil, daal (lentils), sweets, coconuts, bangles and chunnis, goats, hens and [[liquor]] to the Divine Mother here. As an average estimate, devotees offer more than 60,000 liquor bottles during Navratras alone, which distributed to the beggars sitting outside the temple, and goes into a 'Sharab Kund' built on the temple's premises.<ref>http://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/donate-online/religious-offering-inner/1323430251</ref>\n\n=== Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib ===\n[[File:Dukh Nivaran 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran Sahib]], Patiala]]\nAccording to local tradition, supported by an old handwritten document preserved in the Gurdwara, one Bhag Ram, a Jhivar of Lehal, waited upon ninth Guru of Sikhs [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] during his sojourn at Saifabad (now Bahadurgarh). He requested that the Guru might be pleased to visit and bless his village so that its inhabitants could be rid of a severe and mysterious sickness which had been their bane for a long time.\n\nThe [[Sikh gurus|Guru]] visited Lehal on Magh sudi 5, 1728 Bikram/24 January 1672 and stayed under a [[Banyan|banyan tree]] by the side of a pond. The sickness in the village subsided. The site where Guru Tegh Bahadur had sat came to be known as [[Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran Sahib|Dukh Nivaran]], literally meaning eradicator of suffering. Devotees have faith in the healing qualities of water in the Sarovar attached to the shrine. It is still believed that any illness can be cured by 'ishnaan' on five consecutive [[Panchami]]. It is in the vicinity of Patiala Bus Station.\n\n=== Gurdwara Moti Bagh ===\nGurudwara Moti Baag is situated in the outerskirts of the Patiala City. When Shri Guru Teg Bahadur started his journey towards [[Delhi]], he came here via [[Kiratpur Sahib]], Bharatgarh Sahib, Roap Makar, Kabulpur etc. Saint Saif Ali Khan was a great follower of Guru, To fulfil his wish Guru Sahib came to his Place Saifabad (Bahadur Garh). The holly Guru stayed here for 3 Months. Saif Ali Khan Served the Guru with great devotion. In daytime Guru Teg Bahadur used to meditate on the Place inside the Qila (Fort) and at the night time, he would come here. From here the Guru left for [[Samana, Punjab|Samana]] and stayed in the Haveli of Muhamad Bakhshish. From there onward, Guru Sahib left towards Cheeka Via Karhali, Balbera.\n\n=== Bahadurgarh Fort ===\nThe Bahadurgarh Fort is 6 kilometres away from Patiala city. It is situated on the Patiala-Chandigarh road. The fort was constructed by [[mughal empire|mughal]] Nawab Saif Khan in 1658 A.D where [[Guru Teg Bahadur]] visited him and later renovated by a Sikh ruler Maharaja Karam Singh in 1837. The construction of the entire fort was completed in eight years. A sum of ten lakh rupees was spent on its construction. It covers an area of 2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The fort is enclosed within two rounded walls and a moat. The circumference of the fort is slightly over two kilometers.<ref name=\"bri10\">https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/Chandigarh/Patialas-Mughal-era-fort-to-get-Rs-4-3cr-facelift/articleshow/45714787.cms Patiala's Mughal era fort to get Rs 4.3cr facelift], [[Times of India]], 1 Jan 2015.</ref>\n\nThe name Bahadurgarh fort was given by Maharaja Karam Singh as a tribute to the Sikh Guru Teg Bahadur who stayed here for three months and nine days before leaving for Delhi where he was executed by [[Aurangzeb]] in 1675 CE.<ref name=\"sc2001\">{{cite web|last1=Chandra|first1=Satish|title=Guru Tegh Bahadur's martyrdom|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/2001/10/16/stories/05162524.htm|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"bha2\">{{cite book|author=H.R.

Outside the Qila are the Darshani Gate, a Shiva temple, and bazaar shops which border the streets that run around the Qila and sell precious ornaments, colourful hand-woven fabrics, '[[Jooti|jootis]]' and bright 'Parandis'.\n\nIt was the principal residence of the Patiala royals until the construction of Old Moti Bagh Palace.\n\nThe entrance is through an imposing gate. The architectural style of the palace is a synthesis of late Mughal and Rajasthani. The complex has ten courtyards along the north-south axis. Each courtyard is unique in size and character, some being broad, others very small and others mere slits in the fabric of the building. Though the Androon is a single interconnected building, it is spoken of as a series of palaces. Each set of rooms makes a cluster around a courtyard, and each carries a name: Topkhana, Qila Mubarak, Sheesh Mahal, Treasury and Prison. Ten of the rooms are painted with frescoes or decorated intricately with mirror and gilt.\n\nIn a tiny portion of the complex is a little British construction with Gothic arches, fireplaces made of marble and built-in toilets perched on the Mughal Rajasthani roof. Burj Baba Ala Singh has a fire smouldering ever since the time of Ala Singh, along with a flame brought by him from Jwalaji. Every year it's decorated beautifully for the Heritage Festival.\n\n=== Sheesh Mahal ===\n[[File:Suspension Bridge at Sheesh Mahal, Patiala.jpg|thumb|The suspension bridge at Sheesh Mahal, Patiala]]\nA part of the Old Moti Bagh Palace built in the 19th century by the Maharajas is the famous Sheesh Mahal, literally meaning the Palace of Mirrors. The mahal contains a large number of frescoes, most of which were made under His Highness Maharaja Narinder Singh. A lake in front of the palace adds to the beauty. Lakshman Jhula, a bridge built across the lake, is a famous attraction. A museum housing the largest collection of medals from the world collected by [[His Highness]] [[Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]] is here.\n\nCurrently, the museum along with the main building is closed for public viewing because of renovation. However, tourists can access the surroundings of the Mahal along with the Lakshman Jhula.\n\n=== Baradari Gardens ===\n[[File:RajindraKothi.jpg|thumb|right|Rajindra Kothi, Patiala located in the Baradari Gardens, now a heritage hotel]]\nThe Baradari Gardens, the garden with 12 gates, are in the north of old Patiala city, just outside Sheranwala Gate.

It is the fourth largest city in the state and is the administrative capital of [[Patiala district]]. Patiala is located around the ''[[Qila Mubarak, Patiala|Qila Mubarak]]'' (the 'Fortunate Castle') constructed by the [[Sidhu]] [[Jat]] chieftain [[Ala Singh]], who founded the royal dynasty of [[Patiala State]] in 1763, and after whom the city is named.\n\nIn popular culture, the city remains famous for its traditional ''[[Patiala Shahi Pagg|Patiala shahi]]'' [[turban]] (a type of headgear), ''paranda'' (a tasselled tag for braiding hair), ''Patiala salwar'' (a type of female trousers), ''[[jutti]]'' (a type of footwear) and [[Patiala peg]] (a measure of liquor).<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://patiala.nic.in/html/history.htm#introduction|title=History of Patiala|publisher=Official Website of District Patiala|accessdate=19 August 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907045829/http://patiala.nic.in/html/history.htm#introduction|archivedate=7 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n'Patiala' comes from the roots ''pati'' and ''ala'', the former is [[Urdu]] for a \"strip of land\" and ''<nowiki/>'ala''<nowiki/>' comes from the name of the founder of the city, Ala Singh.

After the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761 in which the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] were defeated by the [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]], the writ of the Afghans prevailed throughout Punjab. It is at this stage that the rulers of Patiala began to acquire ensigns of royalty. The Patiala state saw more than forty years of a ceaseless power struggle with the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]], [[Maratha Empire]] and the [[Sikh Empire]] of [[Lahore]].\n\nIn 1808, the Raja of Patiala entered into a treaty with the [[British Raj|British]] against [[Sikh]] ruler [[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]] of Lahore in 1808, thus becoming collaborator in the grand empire building process by the British in, the sub-continent of India. Patiala became a [[17-guns salute]] state during the [[British Raj]]. The rulers of Patiala such as Karam Singh, Narinder Singh, [[Mahendra Singh of Patiala|Mahendra Singh]], [[Rajinder Singh]], [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Bhupinder Singh]], and [[Yadavindra Singh|Yadvindra Singh]] were treated with respect and dignity by the British.\n\n[[File:PATIALA,QILLA MUBARAK.jpg|thumb|left|The Darshani Gate (the main gate of the [[Qila Mubarak, Patiala|Qila Mubarak]]), built in the 18th century. The city was built around the fort.]]\nThe city of Patiala was designed and developed according to a plan akin to that of [[Hindu temple architecture|temple architecture]], the first settlers of Patiala were the [[Punjabi Hindus|Hindus]] of Sirhind, who opened their business establishments outside the Darshani Gate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://patiala.gov.in/html/history.htm|title=History Of Patiala|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe royal house is now headed by [[Amarinder Singh|Captain Amarinder Singh]] who is also the current [[Chief Minister of Punjab (India)|Chief Minister of Punjab]]. The royals are considered cultural and political icons in east Punjab.\n\nMaharaja Karam Singh who ruled from 1813 to 1845 (the Sikh Kingdom of Patiala in Punjab) joined the British East India Company and helped the British during the First Anglo Sikh wars against the Sikh Empire of Maharajah Ranjit Singh of Punjab which was larger and extended from Tibet Kashmir, plains of Punjab to Peshawar near the Afghan borders.\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n\n===Kali Devi Mandir===\n[[File:Shri Kali Devi Patiala.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Murti]]'' of Maa kali at the [[Shri Kali Devi Temple, Patiala]]. The temple was commissioned by the Sikh ruler of Patiala, [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]] in 1936.]]\n[[Shri Kali Devi Temple, Patiala|Kali Devi Temple]] is a [[Hindu temple]] dedicated to [[Maa Kaali]]. The temple was built by the Sikh ruler of the Patiala State, [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]], who financed the building of the temple in his capital and oversaw its installation in 1936. Legend has it that the Maharaja built the temple to protect the city from flooding and performed annual sacrifice at the temple. Bhupinder Singh ruled the princely state of Patiala from 1900 to 1938. He brought the 6-ft statue of Divine Mother Kali and Paawan Jyoti from Bengal to Patiala and offered the first [[Animal sacrifice in Hinduism|Bali]] (sacrifice) of a water buffalo to the temple. Because of the temple's beautiful structure, it has been declared a national monument. This large complex attracts devotees, [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]], from distant places.\n\nA much older temple of Raj Rajeshwari is also situated in the centre of this complex. The temple is situated opposite the Baradari garden at Mall Road. Devotees offer mustard oil, daal (lentils), sweets, coconuts, bangles and chunnis, goats, hens and [[liquor]] to the Divine Mother here. As an average estimate, devotees offer more than 60,000 liquor bottles during Navratras alone, which distributed to the beggars sitting outside the temple, and goes into a 'Sharab Kund' built on the temple's premises.<ref>http://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/donate-online/religious-offering-inner/1323430251</ref>\n\n=== Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib ===\n[[File:Dukh Nivaran 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran Sahib]], Patiala]]\nAccording to local tradition, supported by an old handwritten document preserved in the Gurdwara, one Bhag Ram, a Jhivar of Lehal, waited upon ninth Guru of Sikhs [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] during his sojourn at Saifabad (now Bahadurgarh). He requested that the Guru might be pleased to visit and bless his village so that its inhabitants could be rid of a severe and mysterious sickness which had been their bane for a long time.\n\nThe [[Sikh gurus|Guru]] visited Lehal on Magh sudi 5, 1728 Bikram/24 January 1672 and stayed under a [[Banyan|banyan tree]] by the side of a pond. The sickness in the village subsided. The site where Guru Tegh Bahadur had sat came to be known as [[Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran Sahib|Dukh Nivaran]], literally meaning eradicator of suffering. Devotees have faith in the healing qualities of water in the Sarovar attached to the shrine. It is still believed that any illness can be cured by 'ishnaan' on five consecutive [[Panchami]]. It is in the vicinity of Patiala Bus Station.\n\n=== Gurdwara Moti Bagh ===\nGurudwara Moti Baag is situated in the outerskirts of the Patiala City. When Shri Guru Teg Bahadur started his journey towards [[Delhi]], he came here via [[Kiratpur Sahib]], Bharatgarh Sahib, Roap Makar, Kabulpur etc. Saint Saif Ali Khan was a great follower of Guru, To fulfil his wish Guru Sahib came to his Place Saifabad (Bahadur Garh). The holly Guru stayed here for 3 Months. Saif Ali Khan Served the Guru with great devotion. In daytime Guru Teg Bahadur used to meditate on the Place inside the Qila (Fort) and at the night time, he would come here. From here the Guru left for [[Samana, Punjab|Samana]] and stayed in the Haveli of Muhamad Bakhshish. From there onward, Guru Sahib left towards Cheeka Via Karhali, Balbera.\n\n=== Bahadurgarh Fort ===\nThe Bahadurgarh Fort is 6 kilometres away from Patiala city. It is situated on the Patiala-Chandigarh road. The fort was constructed by [[mughal empire|mughal]] Nawab Saif Khan in 1658 A.D where [[Guru Teg Bahadur]] visited him and later renovated by a Sikh ruler Maharaja Karam Singh in 1837. The construction of the entire fort was completed in eight years. A sum of ten lakh rupees was spent on its construction. It covers an area of 2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The fort is enclosed within two rounded walls and a moat.

Outside the Qila are the Darshani Gate, a Shiva temple, and bazaar shops which border the streets that run around the Qila and sell precious ornaments, colourful hand-woven fabrics, '[[Jooti|jootis]]' and bright 'Parandis'.\n\nIt was the principal residence of the Patiala royals until the construction of Old Moti Bagh Palace.\n\nThe entrance is through an imposing gate. The architectural style of the palace is a synthesis of late Mughal and Rajasthani. The complex has ten courtyards along the north-south axis. Each courtyard is unique in size and character, some being broad, others very small and others mere slits in the fabric of the building. Though the Androon is a single interconnected building, it is spoken of as a series of palaces. Each set of rooms makes a cluster around a courtyard, and each carries a name: Topkhana, Qila Mubarak, Sheesh Mahal, Treasury and Prison. Ten of the rooms are painted with frescoes or decorated intricately with mirror and gilt.\n\nIn a tiny portion of the complex is a little British construction with Gothic arches, fireplaces made of marble and built-in toilets perched on the Mughal Rajasthani roof. Burj Baba Ala Singh has a fire smouldering ever since the time of Ala Singh, along with a flame brought by him from Jwalaji. Every year it's decorated beautifully for the Heritage Festival.\n\n=== Sheesh Mahal ===\n[[File:Suspension Bridge at Sheesh Mahal, Patiala.jpg|thumb|The suspension bridge at Sheesh Mahal, Patiala]]\nA part of the Old Moti Bagh Palace built in the 19th century by the Maharajas is the famous Sheesh Mahal, literally meaning the Palace of Mirrors. The mahal contains a large number of frescoes, most of which were made under His Highness Maharaja Narinder Singh. A lake in front of the palace adds to the beauty. Lakshman Jhula, a bridge built across the lake, is a famous attraction. A museum housing the largest collection of medals from the world collected by [[His Highness]] [[Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]] is here.\n\nCurrently, the museum along with the main building is closed for public viewing because of renovation.
