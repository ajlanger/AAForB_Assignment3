More silica-rich melts are typically more polymerized, with more linkage of silica tetrahedra, and so are more viscous. Dissolution of water drastically reduces melt viscosity. Higher-temperature melts are less viscous. Furthermore, silicate melt (the liquid phase of magma) is [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]], meaning it flows like a liquid under low stresses, but once the applied stress exceeds a critical value the melt can not dissipate the stress fast enough through relaxation alone, resulting in transient fracture propagation. Once stresses are reduced below the critical threshold, the melt viscously relaxes once more and heals the fracture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wadsworth|first=Fabian B.|last2=Witcher|first2=Taylor|last3=Vossen|first3=Caron E.

Within the solid earth, the temperature of a rock is controlled by the [[geothermal gradient]] and the [[radioactive decay]] within the rock. The geothermal gradient averages about 25&nbsp;\u00b0C/km with a wide range from a low of 5\u201310&nbsp;\u00b0C/km within oceanic trenches and subduction zones to 30\u201380&nbsp;\u00b0C/km under mid-ocean ridges and volcanic arc environments.\n\n===Density===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The composition of a rock may also be considered to include ''volatile'' phases such as [[water]] and [[carbon dioxide]].\n\nThe presence of volatile phases in a rock under pressure can stabilize a melt fraction. The presence of even 0.8% water may reduce the temperature of melting by as much as 100&nbsp;\u00b0C. Conversely, the loss of water and volatiles from a magma may cause it to essentially freeze or solidify.\n\nAlso a major portion of almost all magma is [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], which is a compound of silicon and oxygen. Magma also contains gases, which expand as the magma rises. Magma that is high in silica resists flowing, so expanding gases are trapped in it. Pressure builds up until the gases blast out in a violent, dangerous explosion. Magma that is relatively poor in silica flows easily, so gas bubbles move up through it and escape fairly gently.\n\n==Origins of magma by partial melting==\n\n===Partial melting===\nMelting of solid rocks to form magma is controlled by three physical parameters: temperature, pressure, and composition. The most common mechanisms of magma generation in the mantle are [[Igneous rock#Decompression|decompression melting]],<ref>Geological Society of America, ''Plates, Plumes, And Paradigms'', pp. 590 ff., 2005, {{ISBN|0-8137-2388-4}}</ref> heating (e.g., by interaction with a hot [[mantle plume]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=I.

Mechanisms are discussed further in the entry for [[igneous rock]].\n\nWhen rocks melt, they do so slowly and gradually because most rocks are made of several [[minerals]], which all have different melting points; moreover, the physical and chemical relationships controlling the melting are complex. As a rock melts, for example, its volume changes. When enough rock is melted, the small globules of melt (generally occurring between mineral grains) link up and soften the rock. Under pressure within the earth, as little as a fraction of a percent of partial melting may be sufficient to cause melt to be squeezed from its source.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Faul|first=Ulrich H.|date=2001|title=Melt retention and segregation beneath mid-ocean ridges|journal=Nature|volume=410|issue=6831|pages=920\u2013923|doi=10.1038/35073556|pmid=11309614|bibcode=2001Natur.410..920F|issn=0028-0836}}</ref> Melts can stay in place long enough to melt to 20% or even 35%, but rocks are rarely melted in excess of 50%, because eventually the melted rock mass becomes a crystal-and-melt mush that can then ascend ''en masse'' as a [[diapir]], which may then cause further decompression melting.\n\n===Geochemical implications of partial melting===\nThe degree of partial melting is critical to determination of the characteristics of the magma it produces, and  the likelihood that a melt forms reflects the degrees to which incompatible and  [[Compatibility (geochemistry)|compatible elements]] are involved. [[Compatibility (geochemistry)|Incompatible elements]] commonly include [[potassium]], [[barium]], [[caesium]], and [[rubidium]].\n\nRock types produced by small degrees of partial melting in the [[Earth's mantle]] are typically alkaline ([[Calcium|Ca]], [[Sodium|Na]]), potassic ([[Potassium|K]]) or [[peralkaline]] (in which the aluminium to silica ratio is high). Typically, primitive melts of this composition form [[lamprophyre]], [[lamproite]], [[kimberlite]] and sometimes [[nepheline]]-bearing [[mafic]] rocks such as [[alkali basalt]]s and [[essexite]] gabbros or even [[carbonatite]].\n\n[[Pegmatite]] may be produced by low degrees of partial melting of the crust. Some [[granite]]-composition magmas are [[eutectic]] (or cotectic) melts, and they may be produced by low to high degrees of partial melting of the crust, as well as by [[fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallization]]. At high degrees of partial melting of the crust, [[granitoids]] such as [[tonalite]], [[granodiorite]] and [[monzonite]] can be produced, but other mechanisms are typically important in producing them.\n\n==Evolution of magmas==\n\n===Primary melts===\nWhen rock melts, the liquid is a ''primary melt''. Primary melts have not undergone any differentiation and represent the starting composition of a magma. In nature it is rare to find primary melts. The [[leucosomes]] of [[migmatite]]s are examples of primary melts. Primary melts derived from the mantle are especially important, and are known as ''primitive melts'' or primitive magmas. By finding the primitive magma composition of a magma series it is possible to model the composition of the mantle from which a melt was formed, which is important in understanding evolution of the [[Earth's mantle|mantle]].{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Parental melts===\nWhen it is impossible to find the primitive or primary magma composition, it is often useful{{who said|date=September 2017}} to attempt to identify a parental melt. A parental melt is a magma composition from which the observed range of magma chemistries has been derived by the processes of [[igneous differentiation]]. It need not be a primitive melt.\n\nFor instance, a series of basalt flows are assumed to be related to one another. A composition from which they could reasonably be produced by fractional crystallization is termed a ''parental melt''. Fractional crystallization models would be produced to test the hypothesis that they share a common parental melt.\n\nAt high degrees of partial melting of the mantle, [[komatiite]] and [[picrite]] are produced.\n\n==Migration and solidification of magmas==\nMagma develops within the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] or [[Crust (geology)|crust]] where the temperature and pressure conditions favor the molten state. After its formation, magma buoyantly rises toward the Earth's surface. As it migrates through the crust, magma may collect and reside in [[magma chamber]]s (though recent work suggests that magma may be stored in trans-crustal crystal-rich mush zones rather than dominantly liquid magma chambers <ref name=\"Sparks 2017 35\u201340\"/>). Magma can remain in a chamber until it cools and crystallizes forming igneous rock, it erupts as a [[volcano]], or moves into another magma chamber.There are two known processes by which magma changes: by crystallization within the crust or mantle to form a [[pluton]], or by [[volcanic eruption]] to become [[lava]] or [[tephra]].\n\n=== Plutonism ===\nWhen magma cools it begins to form solid mineral phases. Some of these settle at the bottom of the magma chamber forming [[Cumulate rock|cumulates]] that might form mafic [[layered intrusion]]s. Magma that cools slowly within a magma chamber usually ends up forming bodies of plutonic rocks such as [[gabbro]], [[diorite]] and [[granite]], depending upon the composition of the magma. Alternatively, if the magma is erupted it forms [[volcanic rock]]s such as [[basalt]], [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] (the extrusive equivalents of gabbro, diorite and granite, respectively).\n\n===Volcanism===\n{{Main|Volcanism}}\nDuring a volcanic eruption the magma that leaves the underground is called [[lava]]. Lava cools and solidifies relatively quickly compared to underground bodies of magma. This fast cooling does not allow crystals to grow large, and a part of the melt does not crystallize at all, becoming glass. Rocks largely composed of volcanic glass include [[obsidian]], [[scoria]] and [[pumice]].\n\nBefore and during volcanic eruptions, [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatiles]] such as CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O partially leave the melt through a process known as [[exsolution]]. Magma with low water content becomes increasingly [[Viscosity|viscous]]. If massive exsolution occurs when magma heads upwards during a volcanic eruption, the resulting eruption is usually explosive.\n\n==Magma usage for energy production==\nThe [[Iceland Deep Drilling Project]], while drilling several 5,000m holes in an attempt to harness the heat in the volcanic bedrock below the surface of Iceland, struck a pocket of magma at 2,100m in 2009. Because this was only the third time in recorded history that magma had been reached, IDDP decided to invest in the hole, naming it IDDP-1.\n\nA cemented steel case was constructed in the hole with a perforation at the bottom close to the magma. The high temperatures and pressure of the magma steam were used to generate 36MW of power, making IDDP-1 the world's first magma-enhanced geothermal system.<ref name=\"Geothermics Magazine, Vol. 49 (January 2014)\">{{cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03756505/49/supp/C|title=Geothermics Magazine, Vol. 49 (January 2014)|author=Wilfred Allan Elders, Gu\u00f0mundur \u00d3mar Fri\u00f0leifsson and Bjarni P\u00e1lsson|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Magmatic processes}}\n{{Types of volcanic eruptions}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Igneous petrology]]\n[[Category:Igneous rocks]]\n[[Category:Volcanism]]\n", "text_old": "{{hatnote|\"Magmatic\" redirects here.

The physical behaviours of melts depend upon their atomic structures as well as upon temperature and pressure and composition.<ref>Watson, E. B.; Hochella, M. F. and Parsons, I.

More silica-rich melts are typically more polymerized, with more linkage of silica tetrahedra, and so are more viscous. Dissolution of water drastically reduces melt viscosity. Higher-temperature melts are less viscous. Furthermore, silicate melt (the liquid phase of magma) is [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]], meaning it flows like a liquid under low stresses, but once the applied stress exceeds a critical value the melt can not dissipate the stress fast enough through relaxation alone, resulting in transient fracture propagation. Once stresses are reduced below the critical threshold, the melt viscously relaxes once more and heals the fracture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wadsworth|first=Fabian B.|last2=Witcher|first2=Taylor|last3=Vossen|first3=Caron E.

Within the solid earth, the temperature of a rock is controlled by the [[geothermal gradient]] and the [[radioactive decay]] within the rock. The geothermal gradient averages about 25&nbsp;\u00b0C/km with a wide range from a low of 5\u201310&nbsp;\u00b0C/km within oceanic trenches and subduction zones to 30\u201380&nbsp;\u00b0C/km under mid-ocean ridges and volcanic arc environments.\n\n===Density===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The composition of a rock may also be considered to include ''volatile'' phases such as [[water]] and [[carbon dioxide]].\n\nThe presence of volatile phases in a rock under pressure can stabilize a melt fraction. The presence of even 0.8% water may reduce the temperature of melting by as much as 100&nbsp;\u00b0C. Conversely, the loss of water and volatiles from a magma may cause it to essentially freeze or solidify.\n\nAlso a major portion of almost all magma is [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], which is a compound of silicon and oxygen. Magma also contains gases, which expand as the magma rises. Magma that is high in silica resists flowing, so expanding gases are trapped in it. Pressure builds up until the gases blast out in a violent, dangerous explosion. Magma that is relatively poor in silica flows easily, so gas bubbles move up through it and escape fairly gently.\n\n==Origins of magma by partial melting==\n\n===Partial melting===\nMelting of solid rocks to form magma is controlled by three physical parameters: temperature, pressure, and composition. The most common mechanisms of magma generation in the mantle are [[Igneous rock#Decompression|decompression melting]],<ref>Geological Society of America, ''Plates, Plumes, And Paradigms'', pp. 590 ff., 2005, {{ISBN|0-8137-2388-4}}</ref> heating (e.g., by interaction with a hot [[mantle plume]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=I.

Mechanisms are discussed further in the entry for [[igneous rock]].\n\nWhen rocks melt, they do so slowly and gradually because most rocks are made of several [[minerals]], which all have different melting points; moreover, the physical and chemical relationships controlling the melting are complex. As a rock melts, for example, its volume changes. When enough rock is melted, the small globules of melt (generally occurring between mineral grains) link up and soften the rock. Under pressure within the earth, as little as a fraction of a percent of partial melting may be sufficient to cause melt to be squeezed from its source.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Faul|first=Ulrich H.|date=2001|title=Melt retention and segregation beneath mid-ocean ridges|journal=Nature|volume=410|issue=6831|pages=920\u2013923|doi=10.1038/35073556|pmid=11309614|bibcode=2001Natur.410..920F|issn=0028-0836}}</ref> Melts can stay in place long enough to melt to 20% or even 35%, but rocks are rarely melted in excess of 50%, because eventually the melted rock mass becomes a crystal-and-melt mush that can then ascend ''en masse'' as a [[diapir]], which may then cause further decompression melting.\n\n===Geochemical implications of partial melting===\nThe degree of partial melting is critical to determination of the characteristics of the magma it produces, and  the likelihood that a melt forms reflects the degrees to which incompatible and  [[Compatibility (geochemistry)|compatible elements]] are involved. [[Compatibility (geochemistry)|Incompatible elements]] commonly include [[potassium]], [[barium]], [[caesium]], and [[rubidium]].\n\nRock types produced by small degrees of partial melting in the [[Earth's mantle]] are typically alkaline ([[Calcium|Ca]], [[Sodium|Na]]), potassic ([[Potassium|K]]) or [[peralkaline]] (in which the aluminium to silica ratio is high). Typically, primitive melts of this composition form [[lamprophyre]], [[lamproite]], [[kimberlite]] and sometimes [[nepheline]]-bearing [[mafic]] rocks such as [[alkali basalt]]s and [[essexite]] gabbros or even [[carbonatite]].\n\n[[Pegmatite]] may be produced by low degrees of partial melting of the crust. Some [[granite]]-composition magmas are [[eutectic]] (or cotectic) melts, and they may be produced by low to high degrees of partial melting of the crust, as well as by [[fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallization]]. At high degrees of partial melting of the crust, [[granitoids]] such as [[tonalite]], [[granodiorite]] and [[monzonite]] can be produced, but other mechanisms are typically important in producing them.\n\n==Evolution of magmas==\n\n===Primary melts===\nWhen rock melts, the liquid is a ''primary melt''. Primary melts have not undergone any differentiation and represent the starting composition of a magma. In nature it is rare to find primary melts. The [[leucosomes]] of [[migmatite]]s are examples of primary melts. Primary melts derived from the mantle are especially important, and are known as ''primitive melts'' or primitive magmas. By finding the primitive magma composition of a magma series it is possible to model the composition of the mantle from which a melt was formed, which is important in understanding evolution of the [[Earth's mantle|mantle]].{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Parental melts===\nWhen it is impossible to find the primitive or primary magma composition, it is often useful{{who said|date=September 2017}} to attempt to identify a parental melt. A parental melt is a magma composition from which the observed range of magma chemistries has been derived by the processes of [[igneous differentiation]]. It need not be a primitive melt.\n\nFor instance, a series of basalt flows are assumed to be related to one another. A composition from which they could reasonably be produced by fractional crystallization is termed a ''parental melt''. Fractional crystallization models would be produced to test the hypothesis that they share a common parental melt.\n\nAt high degrees of partial melting of the mantle, [[komatiite]] and [[picrite]] are produced.\n\n==Migration and solidification of magmas==\nMagma develops within the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] or [[Crust (geology)|crust]] where the temperature and pressure conditions favor the molten state. After its formation, magma buoyantly rises toward the Earth's surface. As it migrates through the crust, magma may collect and reside in [[magma chamber]]s (though recent work suggests that magma may be stored in trans-crustal crystal-rich mush zones rather than dominantly liquid magma chambers <ref name=\"Sparks 2017 35\u201340\"/>). Magma can remain in a chamber until it cools and crystallizes forming igneous rock, it erupts as a [[volcano]], or moves into another magma chamber.There are two known processes by which magma changes: by crystallization within the crust or mantle to form a [[pluton]], or by [[volcanic eruption]] to become [[lava]] or [[tephra]].\n\n=== Plutonism ===\nWhen magma cools it begins to form solid mineral phases. Some of these settle at the bottom of the magma chamber forming [[Cumulate rock|cumulates]] that might form mafic [[layered intrusion]]s. Magma that cools slowly within a magma chamber usually ends up forming bodies of plutonic rocks such as [[gabbro]], [[diorite]] and [[granite]], depending upon the composition of the magma. Alternatively, if the magma is erupted it forms [[volcanic rock]]s such as [[basalt]], [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] (the extrusive equivalents of gabbro, diorite and granite, respectively).\n\n===Volcanism===\n{{Main|Volcanism}}\nDuring a volcanic eruption the magma that leaves the underground is called [[lava]]. Lava cools and solidifies relatively quickly compared to underground bodies of magma. This fast cooling does not allow crystals to grow large, and a part of the melt does not crystallize at all, becoming glass. Rocks largely composed of volcanic glass include [[obsidian]], [[scoria]] and [[pumice]].\n\nBefore and during volcanic eruptions, [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatiles]] such as CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O partially leave the melt through a process known as [[exsolution]]. Magma with low water content becomes increasingly [[Viscosity|viscous]]. If massive exsolution occurs when magma heads upwards during a volcanic eruption, the resulting eruption is usually explosive.\n\n==Magma usage for energy production==\nThe [[Iceland Deep Drilling Project]], while drilling several 5,000m holes in an attempt to harness the heat in the volcanic bedrock below the surface of Iceland, struck a pocket of magma at 2,100m in 2009. Because this was only the third time in recorded history that magma had been reached, IDDP decided to invest in the hole, naming it IDDP-1.\n\nA cemented steel case was constructed in the hole with a perforation at the bottom close to the magma. The high temperatures and pressure of the magma steam were used to generate 36MW of power, making IDDP-1 the world's first magma-enhanced geothermal system.<ref name=\"Geothermics Magazine, Vol. 49 (January 2014)\">{{cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03756505/49/supp/C|title=Geothermics Magazine, Vol. 49 (January 2014)|author=Wilfred Allan Elders, Gu\u00f0mundur \u00d3mar Fri\u00f0leifsson and Bjarni P\u00e1lsson|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Magmatic processes}}\n{{Types of volcanic eruptions}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Igneous petrology]]\n[[Category:Igneous rocks]]\n[[Category:Volcanism]]\n", "name_user": "194.165.59.222", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eTemperature:Spell wrongs)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma"}
