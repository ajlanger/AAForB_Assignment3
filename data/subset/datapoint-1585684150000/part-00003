The park consisted primarily of water-based attractions and originally opened to the public in 1978, under the ownership of Great American Recreation (GAR).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterpark.mountaincreek.com/park/about/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601072125/http://waterpark.mountaincreek.com/park/about/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 1, 2012 |title=Action Park Waterpark, Vernon NJ |website=Mountain Creek |accessdate=April 3, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nAction Park featured three separate attraction areas: the Alpine Center, Motorworld, and Waterworld.

At least six people are known to have died as a result of mishaps on rides at the park, and it was given nicknames such as \"[[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] Park\",<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> \"Accident Park\", and \"[[Class action|Class Action]] Park\".<ref name=\"Jersey Ed\">{{cite news|author=Jersey Ed|date= May 2006|title=We Called it Accident Park (in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\")| work=Weird NJ|page= 28}}</ref>  Little effort was made by state regulators to address these issues, despite the park's history of repeat violations. In its later years, [[Tort|personal injury]] lawsuits led to the closure of increasing numbers of rides, and eventually the entire park closed, in 1996.\n\nOn February 9, 1998, resort developer [[Intrawest]] announced the purchase of the majority of the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, including Action Park and other developable real estate lands that GAR owned.<ref>http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Intrawest+Adds+Ninth+Resort+to+Network-a020216861</ref> The park received a massive overhaul, which included extensively renovating and repairing attractions, especially those deemed either outright unsafe or inappropriate relative to Intrawest's vision of the park, with some being removed entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actionpark.com/3-98.html|title=New Water Park At Vernon Valley Scheduled To Open June 15|website=actionpark.com|access-date=2019-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980425131249/http://www.actionpark.com/3-98.html|archive-date=1998-04-25}}</ref>Afterwards, the park reopened as [[Mountain Creek Waterpark]].\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|footer_align=center|perrow = 1|total_width=200\n| image1 = Action Park (3000196846).jpg | caption1 = Landing at the end of a waterslide\n| image2 = Action Park (3000201136).jpg | caption2 = Mini-slide built into the side of a mountain\n}}\nThe idea for the park began in 1976 when Eugene Mulvihill and his company Great American Recreation (GAR), the owners of the recently combined [[Mountain Creek|Vernon Valley/Great Gorge]] ski area, wanted to find a way to generate revenue during the summer. That year they followed the trend of many other ski areas and opened a {{convert|2700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[alpine slide]] down one of the steep ski trails.<ref>{{cite news|title=So What If There's No Snow, Go Sliding Down Hill Anyway|work=Ocala Star-Banner|date=November 5, 1976|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_o9PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AAYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3698%2C1193697}}</ref>  For the summer of 1978, Mulvihill added two [[water slide]]s and a [[Go-kart|go-kart track]], and named the collection of rides the \"Vernon Valley Summer Park\".<ref>https://archive.org/stream/towntopicsprince3328unse/towntopicsprince3328unse_djvu.txt</ref> The following year, more water slides and a small deep-water swimming pool, as well as tennis courts and a softball field, were added to what became known as the Waterworld section of \"Action Park\". By 1980, Motorworld had been carved out of swampy lands the ski area owned across [[New Jersey Route 94|Route 94]]. Combined, these areas formed one of North America's earliest modern water parks.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/>\n\nUltimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nAction Park's most successful years were the early- and mid-1980s. Most rides were still operating, and the park's dangerous reputation had not yet developed. In 1982, two guests died at the park within a week of each other, leading to the permanent closure of one ride.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sometimes-interesting.com/2014/02/07/there-was-nothing-in-the-world-like-action-park/|title=There was Nothing in the World Like Action park|website=Sometimes-Interesting|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}</ref> Despite this, people continued to come in massive numbers. The park's fortunes began to turn with two deaths in the summer of 1984, and the legal and financial problems that stemmed from the ensuing lawsuits. A state investigation of misconduct in the leasing of state land to Action Park led to a 110-count [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] against the nine related companies that ran the park and their executives for operating an unauthorized [[insurance]] company.<ref name=\"NJ Herald\">McKay, Martha; May 12, 2005; [http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NjkyNjgy Ultimate wine snob] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222234456/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NjkyNjgy |date=December 22, 2007 }}; ''[[New Jersey Herald]]'', retrieved August 27, 2006. </ref> Many took pretrial intervention to avoid prosecution; CEO Eugene Mulvihill pleaded guilty that November to five [[insurance fraud]]-related charges.<ref name=\"state investigation\">New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, date not given,  [http://www.state.nj.us/sci/pdf/hist6.pdf#search=%22%22Eugene%20Mulvihill%22%22 ''Concrete Results: Ensuring Justice, Saving Taxpayers' Money''], 47, retrieved August 27, 2006.</ref>  Still, attendance remained high and the park remained profitable, at least on paper.\n\nThe park entertained over one million visitors per year during the 1980s, with as many as 12,000 coming on some of the busiest weekends.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> Park officials said this made the injury and death rate statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, the director of the [[emergency room]] at a nearby hospital said they treated from five to ten victims of park accidents on some of the busiest days, and the park eventually bought the township of Vernon extra [[ambulance]]s to keep up with the volume.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> In September 1989, GAR negotiated a deal with International Broadcasting Corporation that would result in the sale of Vernon Valley/Great Gorge, and Action Park, for $50 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34601674/|title=OWNER AGREES TO SELL ACTION PARK, SKI AREA|work=The Record|location=New Jersey|date=September 7, 1989}}</ref> IBC, however, backed out of the deal, feeling the site was not suitable for their needs upon further inspections of the properties.<ref>{{cite news|title=FIRM BREAKS OFF DEAL FOR VERNON VALLEY|work=The Star-Ledger|location=Newark, NJ|date=September 27, 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34601847/|title=GREAT GORGE DEAL ICED INT'L BROADCASTING AXES ITS PURCHASE OF SKI, ACTION AREAS|work=The Record|location=New Jersey|date=September 28, 1989}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, the Action Park was being advertised as the world's largest water park.<ref>Action Park commercial from 1994 (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoqAmcgovZw</ref><ref>MTV's Headbanger's Ball with [[Alice in Chains]] at Action Park, Vernon, NJ, July 1993 (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpdCGfaxl7w</ref> Additionally, the park launched a website on which visitors could find information about rides, directions to the park, and lodging, and even enter a lottery for a chance to win park tickets.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19961227075424/http://www.actionpark.com/ - Internet Archive copy of actionpark.com from December 27, 1996]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970412161034/http://www.actionpark.com/ - Internet Archive copy of actionpark.com from April 12, 1997]</ref> In September 1991, Great American Recreation attempted to petition the [[Vernon Township, New Jersey|Vernon Township]] Committee to put a referendum on the November ballot that, if passed, would have legalized the operation of [[Game of skill|games of skill]] and [[Game of chance|chance]] at Action Park.  On September 23, the petition was rejected by the committee because only 643 of the 937 signatures on the petition came from registered voters.\n<ref>{{cite news|title=VERNON REJECTS PETITION ON ACTION PARK GAMES|work=The Star-Ledger|location=Newark, NJ|date=September 24, 1991}}</ref>\n\nA few rides were closed and dismantled due to costly settlements and rising insurance premiums in the 1990s, and the park's attendance began to suffer as a [[recession]] early in that decade reduced the number of visitors.

It allowed guests to compete against other guests in an obstacle course, and against park-employed \"Gladiators\" in jousting matches.  Former bodybuilders Michael and Vince Mancuso designed the attraction, and the employees that guests would compete against in the jousting matches were found by scouting local gyms.<ref name=\"news.google.com\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9N5QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UukMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1147,6299177&dq=action-park&hl=en|title='Action' fitting name for Northern New Jersey Amusement Park|author=Rice, Bill|date=July 26, 1992|work=The Daily Gazette (Schenectady, NY)}}</ref>  Over the course of a day, there were 3 shows, with the guests that ran the fastest obstacle course times in the earlier shows brought back to compete against each other later in the day.<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/> By 1995 the attraction was removed and replaced with a beach volleyball court.\n\n===Alpine slide===\n[[File:Action Park (2999307425).jpg|thumb|right|Chairlift to alpine slide.]]\nAction Park's {{convert|2700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[alpine slide]] descended the mountain beneath one of the ski area's [[chairlift]]s, which provided guests access to the top of the slide. Riders sat on small sleds that had only a brake/accelerator control stick, and rode down the slide in long chutes built into the slope. The ride, and more specifically the sleds, became notorious for causing injuries. The stick that was supposed to control the sled's speed in practice offered just two options on the infrequently maintained vehicles: extremely slow, and a speed described by one former employee as \"death awaits\".<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> The chutes the sleds traveled in were made of [[concrete]], [[fiberglass]], and [[asbestos]], which led to serious [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] on riders who took even mild falls. The tendency of guests to ride in [[bathing suit]]s made the problem worse. The path underneath the chairlift resulted in verbal harassment and [[expectoration|spitting]] from passengers going up for their turn.<ref name=\"Gethard\">Gethard, Chris; October 2005, \"Brothers in Wounded Arms (And Legs) Serving Together at Action Park,\" ''Weird NJ'', 23.</ref>\n\nThe slide led to the first fatality at the park, a [[head injury]] suffered in 1980 by an employee whose sled ran off the track; he then fell down a embankment and hit his head on a rock, killing him. [[Hay bale]]s at the curves were put in place in an attempt to cushion the impact of guests whose sleds jumped the track, a frequent occurrence. While park officials regularly asserted its safety, in the early years of the park the slide was responsible for the bulk of the accidents, injuries, lawsuits, and state citations for safety violations.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> According to state records, in 1984 and 1985 the alpine slide produced 14 [[Bone fracture|fractures]] and 26 [[head injury|head injuries]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nWhen [[Intrawest]] reopened the water park as [[Mountain Creek Waterpark|Mountain Creek]] in spring 1998, they announced the slide would remain open for one final season. However, riders were required to wear [[helmet]]s and [[kneepad]]s. The last day of the slide's operation was September 6 of that year, the day before the park closed for the season, as that year's [[Labor Day]] was rainy and the slide had to be closed.\n\nThe chutes were torn out afterwards, but the route can still be seen from the [[gondola lift|gondola]] that replaced the chairlift.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />  The resort's mountain bike route travels down the site, and crosses over a few wooden footbridges that provided access over the alpine slide. Mountain Creek recently introduced an [[alpine coaster]], which combines elements of an alpine slide and a roller coaster.\n\n===Snapple Snap-Up Whipper Snapper Ride===\nIn 1991, Action Park opened up a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, two-station [[bungee jumping]] tower near the alpine slide.  The next summer, the tower was upgraded to four jumping stations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&dat=19920726&id=9N5QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UukMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1147,6299177 |title='Action' Fitting Name For Northern New Jersey Amusement Park|work=The Daily Gazette |date=July 26, 1992}}</ref> Guests could not drop very far, however, and were tethered to a weight that prevented them from bouncing back up to the top of the tower. The attraction closed with the park in 1996.\n\n===Skateboard park===\nA [[skatepark]] briefly existed near the ski area's ski school building, but closed after one season due to poor design. Bowls were separated by pavement, which in many cases did not meet the edges smoothly. Former park employee Tom Fergus was quoted in the magazine ''[[Weird NJ]]'' as saying that the \"skate park was responsible for so many injuries we covered it up with dirt and pretended it never existed\".<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\">Fergus, Tom; May 2006; \"Another Action Park Employee Spills His Guts\", in [http://weirdnj.com/stories/action-park/ \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"]; ''Weird NJ'', 29</ref>\n\n===Transmobile===\nThe Transmobile was a [[monorail]] that took riders from the Alpine Center across Route 94 to the Cobblestone Village shopping complex and the park's Motorworld section. Riders would sit sideways in cars built for two people. Each stop had two stations, one for guests heading towards the Alpine Center, and one for guests heading to Motorworld. Rides were one way, and riders were not allowed to stay on the ride and travel round-trip without getting off at either end. This restriction sometimes caused conflicts between park staff and riders who either did not understand or did not want to follow the rules.<ref>http://thecenteroftheaction.blogspot.com/2010/05/showdown-at-transmobile.html</ref>\n\nMuch of the Transmobile was dismantled when Intrawest took over the park in 1998. However, the Cobblestone Village station remains in place, as does the right of way through the Village's [[Miniature golf|mini golf]] course.<ref>http://abnf.co/NJ-action_park.htm</ref>\n\n== Motorworld ==\nAction Park's Motorworld section consisted of rides based around powered vehicles and boats on the west side of [[New Jersey Route 94|Route 94]], opposite the main part of the park. This area closed with Action Park in 1996 and never reopened; they have since been replaced with a [[condominium]] development, a restaurant, and additional parking for the [[Mountain Creek]] ski resort.\n=== Land rides ===\n* '''Super Go Karts''': The Super [[Go-kart|Go Karts]] allowed guests to drive around a small loop [[Race track|track]] at a speed of about {{convert|20|mph|km/h}}, controlled by the [[governor (device)|governor devices]] on the karts. However, park employees knew how to circumvent the governors by wedging [[tennis ball]]s into them, and they were known to do so for guests. As a result, an otherwise standard small-engine kart ride became an opportunity to play [[bumper cars]] at {{cvt|50|mph|km/h}}, and many injuries resulted from [[head-on collision]]s.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> Also, the kart's engines were poorly maintained and some riders were overcome by [[gasoline]] fumes as they drove.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/>\n* '''LOLA Cars''': The LOLA Cars were miniature [[Open wheel car|open-cockpit race cars]] on a longer track. Extra money was charged to drive them, and they, too, could be adjusted for speed by park employees, with similarly harmful consequences to riders.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Former employees have said that, after park management briefly set up a [[microbrewery]] nearby, employees would break into the brewery, steal the beer, and then take the cars out and ride them on Route 94.<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\" />\n* '''Battle Action Tanks''': Battle Action Tanks was one of the most popular rides in Motorworld, and it was featured prominently in television ads. For an additional fee, guests could enter a [[chainlink]] fence-enclosed area and operate small tanks for five minutes at a time. The tanks were equipped with tennis ball cannons that enabled riders to shoot at a [[sensor]] prominently mounted on each tank. If hit, the tank stopped operating for 15 seconds, while other guests often took advantage of the delay to hit the disabled vehicle with more fire. Visitors on the outside could also utilize less-costly cannons mounted on the perimeter fence. When workers had to enter the cage to attend to a stuck or crashed tank, which often happened several times a day, they were commonly pelted with tennis balls, despite prohibitions against such behavior. This gave the ride a reputation for being more dangerous for the employees than the guests,<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> making it one of the least popular places to work in the park. It is not known if there were any serious injuries from the tank ride. As of 2018, the area has not been redeveloped and only a vacant lot remains.\n\n=== Watercraft rides ===\n* '''Super Speedboats''': The Super Speedboats were set up in a small pond, known by park staff to be heavily infested with [[snake]]s.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> They could be driven around a small island at {{cvt|35|-|40|mph|km/h}}. While, unlike the land vehicles, there was no way to tamper and increase their speed, many riders nonetheless used them to play bumper boats, and one seriously inebriated rider had to be rescued by the attendant [[lifeguard]] after his boat [[capsize]]d following a collision.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* '''Bumper Boats''': Bumper Boats was a supposedly safer ride than the Super Speedboats, but the [[engine]]s often leaked [[gasoline]], at least once requiring medical attention for one rider who got too much of it on his [[skin]]. Tall riders also often were unable to fit their legs on the small-sized boats, resulting in them hanging off of the sides of the boats and being fractured during collisions.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\n=== Air rides ===\n* '''Space Shot''': The Space Shot attraction was a tower [[Drop tower|drop ride]], common in many amusement parks. This ride was opened for the park's final season in 1996, and again under [[Mountain Creek]] management in 1998. In July 1998 the ride was purchased by the [[Six Flags]]-owned [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]] theme park in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34601897/|title=CATAPULTED INTO AMUSEMENT PARK HISTORY|work=The Record|location=New Jersey|date=July 24, 1998}}</ref>\n* '''Sling Shot''': Sling Shot was a [[Funtime (manufacturer)|bungee cord ride]] in which two riders sat in a seat and were strapped in while the ride was shot up in the air and supported by a bungee cord. Riders looped upside down. There are a few similar rides still standing in a handful of major amusement parks, the most common name being the Slingshot found at many [[Six Flags]] parks, but they are upcharge attractions (an additional charge to admission) due to insurance issues. At Action Park, the extra fee was only $5. This particular ride was open from 1993 to 1995. \"We often wondered how many [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] cases came out of that ride\", one former employee recalled.<ref name=\"Jersey Ed\" />\n\n== Waterworld ==\n\nWater-based attractions made up half of the park's rides and accounted for the greatest share of its [[Casualty (person)|casualty]] count.  Mountain Creek Waterpark and its currently revived Action Park still operates some of these attractions. In addition, there was also a miniature golf course as well as standard pools and rides for children. These were sometimes smaller, safer versions of the park's main attractions.\n\n=== Cannonball Loop ===\n[[File:Action Park looping water slide.jpg|300px|thumb|right|''Cannonball Loop'', the infamous looping water slide, was only opened for brief periods in Action Park's existence.]]\nIn the mid-1980s GAR built an enclosed water slide, not unusual for that time; in fact, the park already had several such slides. On this one, however, they decided to build a [[Loop (roller coaster)|complete vertical loop]] at the end, similar to that of a roller coaster.<ref name=\"Looping water slide picture\">See picture on [http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/forums/cgi/forum1.cgi?read=153156 this discussion thread]</ref> The resulting slide, called the ''Cannonball Loop'', was so intimidating, that employees have reported they were offered $100 ({{Inflation|US|100|1985|fmt=eq}}) to test it. Fergus, who described himself as \"one of the idiots\" who took the offer, said, \"$100 did not buy enough booze to drown out that memory.\"<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\" />\n\nThe slide was opened for only one month in summer 1985 before it was closed at the order of the state's Advisory Board on Carnival Amusement Ride Safety, a highly unusual move at the time.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> One worker told a local newspaper that \"there were too many bloody noses and back injuries\" from riders, and it was widely rumored, and reported in ''Weird NJ'', that some of the [[crash test dummy|test dummies]] sent down before it opened had been [[dismemberment|dismembered]] and [[decapitation|decapitated]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> A rider also reportedly got stuck at the top of the loop due to insufficient water pressure, and a [[Trapdoor|hatch]] had to be installed at the bottom of the slope to allow for future extractions.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nThe ride supposedly reopened a few more times over the years. In the summers of 1995 and 1996, it was opened for several days before further injuries forced its permanent shutdown.\n\nThose who rode the ''Cannonball Loop'' have said that more safety measures were taken than was otherwise common at the park. Riders were weighed, hosed down with cold water, instructed to remove jewelry, and then carefully instructed in how they had to position their bodies to complete the ride.<ref name=\"Steve Braybrook\">Braybrook, Steve; May 2006; [http://weirdnj.com/stories/action-park/ \"A Survivor from Action Park Writes In\"], in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"; ''Weird NJ'', 29.</ref>\nFor the remainder of the park's existence, ''Cannonball Loop'' remained visible near the entrance of Waterworld. It was dismantled shortly after the park closed.\n\nIn 2014, video footage that appeared to show riders going down the ''Cannonball Loop'' was unearthed and published online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/rare-video-of-people-actually-riding-action-parks-infam-1563953390 |title=Rare Video Of People Actually Riding Action Park's Infamous Water Slide |author=Barry Petchesky |work=The Concourse |accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Other notable water attractions ===\n[[File:Action Park (2999353205).jpg|thumb|right|Less buoyant chlorinated water made the wave pool harder to swim in than salt water in the ocean.]] \n* '''The Tidal Wave Pool''': The first patron death occurred here in 1982; another visitor [[drowning|drowned]] in this common water-park attraction five years later. It was, however, the number of people the [[lifeguard]]s saved from a similar fate that made this the only Waterworld attraction to gain its own nickname, \"The Grave Pool\".<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> It was {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|250|ft|m}} long and could hold 500 to 1,000 people. Waves were generated for 20 minutes at a time with 10-minute intervals between them, and could reach as much as {{convert|40|in|m}} in height.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> It was not always obvious that pool depth increased as one got closer to the far end, and there were patrons who only remembered or realized that they could not [[human swimming|swim]] when they were in over their heads and the waves were going full blast. Even those who could swim sometimes exhausted themselves, causing patrons to crowd the side ladders as the waves began, leading to many accidents.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Twelve lifeguards were on duty at all times, and on high-traffic weekends they were known to rescue as many as 30 people, compared to the one or two the average lifeguard might make in a typical season at a [[swimming pool|pool]] or [[lake]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Mountain Creek continues to operate this attraction as the \"High Tide Wavepool\" but made the pool much shallower.\n* '''Aqua Skoot''': Invented by Ken Bailey in the early 1980s,<ref>http://www.slideshare.net/amusementrides/amusement-rides-by-bailey</ref> riders would carry a hard, solid plastic sled up to the top of the ride, go down a slide consisting of rollers akin to those found in factories, warehouses, or assembly lines, and end up in a pool that in most areas was no deeper than a puddle. The idea of the ride was to, once the sled hit the water, skip across the water like a stone. In order to do this the rider had to be in a certain position, leaned back. If the rider was not in this position, the sled would sink into the water as soon as it hit the pool, flinging the rider off head-first, which often resulted in head injuries. Other times, riders would be leaving the pool only to have others crash into them as they were riding. This ride consisted of parallel slides originally. At some point in the mid 1980s, a third slide was added. Each slide was {{convert|30|ft}} long.<ref>http://articles.mcall.com/1990-07-29/entertainment/2760035_1_water-rides-water-slides-water-park/2</ref> The slides were removed when Intrawest took over the resort in 1998; the pool was redesigned into the Lost Island River which is part of the children's section. The platform / tower riders climbed to ride the Aqua Skoot became the Treetop Cabanas in 2003.\n* '''Kamikaze''': This was the more \"tame\" water slide near the Geronimo slides. It was blue in color and featured several drops and rises. Riders would lie on their backs with their arms and legs crossed and go down a \"chute\" which pitched steeply at first and then went up and down several times before ending in a pool. It survived the Mountain Creek redesign, but was removed and scrapped following the 2009 season.\n* '''The Kayak Experience''': It was an imitation [[whitewater]] course that used submerged electric [[Fan (implement)|fans]] to agitate the water above. Frequently the [[kayak]]s got stuck or tipped over, and people had to get out of them to remedy the situation. In 1982, a man died after trying to get back on his kayak and touching the wiring of the fans, sending him into cardiac arrest and leading to its permanent closure.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /><!---- Former park employee Chris Ish says this was in Waterworld; if his account gets published, this will be included here. ----->\n[[File:Action Park (3000182624).jpg|thumb|right|Taking the Tarzan swing into a cold pool.]]\n* '''The Tarzan Swing''': This was a steel arch hanging from a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Wire rope|cable]] over a [[spring (hydrology)|spring]]-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines for the chance to hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a cushioned area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> In 1984, one man died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after experiencing the swing.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* '''Roaring Rapids''': This was a standard raft-based whitewater ride. Reports that the park filed with the state in 1984 noted fractured [[femur]]s, [[collar bone]]s and [[Human nose|noses]], and [[Dislocation (medicine)|dislocated]] [[knee]]s and [[shoulder]]s. This attraction is still open. The left side is known as The Gauley and riders use a single tube. The right side is known as Thunder Run and is a double tube rafting ride.\n* '''Surf Hill''': This ride, common to other water parks at the time, allowed patrons to slide down a water-slick sloped surface on mats into small puddles, until they reached a foam barrier after an upslope at the end. Barriers between lanes were minimal, and people frequently collided with each other on the way down, or at the end. The seventh lane was known as the \"back breaker\", due to its special kicker two-thirds of the way down intended to allow jumps and splashdowns into a larger puddle.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Employees at the park used to like eating at a nearby [[snack bar]] with a good view of the attraction, since it was almost guaranteed that they could see some serious injuries, lost [[bikini]] tops, or both.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Mountain Creek kept this attraction open through 2005, then reopened it in 2012.\n* '''Super Speed Water Slides''': These two water slides, also known as Geronimo Falls, were set slightly apart from the rest of the park and took advantage of nearly vertical slopes to allow riders to attain higher speeds than usually possible. One started with riders going almost vertically downwards and was covered with screening for the first several feet. As barriers on the side of the slides were very low, lifeguards reminded every user to remain flat on their back with their arms at their side as they descended, since there was no way to ride it otherwise and stay on. The fall from both slides had the potential for very serious injury. Those who made it to the bottom found their progress arrested by water\u2014which made a large splash\u2014and then a small pool. Only one of these slides remains today; however, the track was replaced with one that was not as steep. The tracks the old slides followed are still visible. Today it is known as the H-2-Oh-No. Vertigo and Vortex, two adjacent enclosed tube slides, still use the same end splash pool that two of the other old speed slides used.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* '''Diving cliffs''': The area around Roaring Rapids was (and still is) laid out like a kind of [[grotto]], with many lower-intensity attractions. One was a pair of diving [[cliff]]s\u2014one {{convert|23|ft|m}}, the other {{convert|18|ft|m}}\u2014above a {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} pool. However, the pool below was not blocked off from those who might be swimming in or away from other attractions, and nothing at water level gave any indication to swimmers below that they could expect people to dive in right next to them\u2014or right on top of them. The sole lifeguard on duty often had his or her hands full dealing with the results of those collisions.<ref name=\"Gethard\" /> Also, nonswimmers would jump off the cliffs, not fully appreciating how deep the water below was, and have to be rescued. Former employee Tom Fergus says the bottom of the pool was eventually painted white to make it easier to spot any bodies on the bottom. The large pool into which people jumped is no longer used for regular swimming, only to deposit used tubes.<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\" /> \n[[File:Action Park (2999338931).jpg|thumb|right|Carrying tubes up the mountain.]]\n* '''Colorado River Ride''': The Colorado River Ride, which still exists, is a 2-person raft ride that winds its way down a heavily wooded area on the side of the park, with numerous forks allowing riders to take different routes. Unlike in other parks, the river trough was crafted to look like a natural river bed, with jets in the bed at various points adding to the rapid roughness. Riders carried their rafts from the bottom of the ride up to the starting point. Once on the ride, riders would travel down a short incline, propelling them down the ride. As they make it past the first turn, it was common to gain speed. After a few turns, the riders would come to a fork.\n** '''The Main Fork''': Riders would ride under a drenching waterfall into a dark tunnel with many twists, turns, and jagged rocks. Upon exiting the tunnel, riders would twist and turn some more until they reached a small rock pool, and slowly floated out. The final stretch of the river consisted of a large downhill portion complete with bumps, and a {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=mid|-high}} jump where the rafts would momentarily catch air and then slam back onto the surface.\n** '''The Alternative Forks''': Riders would float along a relatively smooth path until they rounded a corner with a waterfall,<ref>1991 footage of Action Park (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xXcQdVr1Zg</ref> and another fork. One path would take riders back to the main path, and dump them at the tunnel's end. The other fork would reconnect with the main path before the rock pool.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">Mountain Creek Colorado River Ride footage from 2013 showing both points where the alternative pathways reconnected with the main path of the ride. (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyiD_lk-4Fk</ref> Originally, a fork carried riders down a set of steep drops, before a curved drop into the main path right at the end.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">1987 footage of Action Park (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iJoL1Q9FY</ref> In the late 1980s, this path was merged into the main pathway, creating the rock pool, and final hill, that are still in use today. Today, the first fork is closed off, but the points where the forks reconnect to the main path are still connected to the ride.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n: Originally, riders rode this attraction two at a time, in yellow inflatable [[dinghy|dinghies]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This was later replaced with large circular four-person rafts. In the [[Mountain Creek]] era, a lift was put in place that carried rafts to the beginning of the ride, eliminating the need for riders to carry them all the way up the hill. Because the ride trough was designed to look and feel like actual river bed, the ride was rough. It was not uncommon for people to hit heads with the other riders, or for the rafts to climb the walls after hitting them at high speed, so now they wear football helmets. A rider recounted to ''[[Weird NJ]]'' how a friend's mother suffered a broken nose when their raft was thrown into a rock wall.<ref name=\"Greg Shpunder\">Shpunder, Greg; May 2006; \"Action Park Designed to Hurt People\" in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"; ''Weird NJ'', 28.</ref> On the curve before the first fork, it was common for rafts to get stuck \u2013 requiring riders to have to jump out, and push the raft \u2013 or wait for the raft behind them to hit them.<ref>More Action Park footage from 1991 (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz2gxQGF1Wc</ref> Inside the tunnel were jagged rocks, which could cause cuts or scrapes if riders placed their hands out.\n\n===The Aerodium===\nThe Aerodium is a skydiving simulator wind tunnel invented in Germany in 1984. In 1987, Action Park built and opened their own Aerodium in the Waterworld section of the park, becoming the first American amusement park to open an Aerodium. The attraction was operated by Aerodium Inc., who would act as a concessionaire for the park through 1997.<ref>http://www.aerodium.com/general_information.htm</ref> Stadium seating encircled the perimeter of the Aerodium, allowing friends and spectators to watch riders fly. Riders wearing a special skydiving suit, helmet, and earplugs would join the [[bodyflight]] instructor one by one on a trampoline-like netting directly over the fan. The instructor would grab each rider's wrists and guide the rider to fall forward, allowing the fan to lift the rider skyward. After a few seconds of flight, the attendant operating the fan would cut the power, causing the rider to fall onto the air cushions surrounding the fan. Park guests' flights were limited to a maximum of {{convert|6|or|7|ft|m}} above the ground, approximately {{convert|1|to|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} over the instructor's head. The Aerodium also caused severe injuries, for example, when a rider instinctively tried to break his fall by extending his arm, which caused shoulder dislocation, severed nerves, and near-permanent paralysis of the arm.\n\n==Factors contributing to the park's safety record==\n\nA range of factors contributed to accidents at the park, from the design and construction of the rides themselves to the makeup of both visitors and staff, and lax government oversight.\n\n===Ride design===\n\nAction Park and its defenders often pointed out that it was one of the first water parks in the nation and thus pioneered ideas that were later widely copied. This meant that visitors were using rides that had not been tested through practical use for very long.  Ride designers may have had insufficient training in [[physics]] or [[engineering]]. \"They seemed to build rides,\" one attendee recalled, \"not knowing how they would work, and [then let] people on them.\"<ref name=\"Callan\">Callan, Matthew; November 22, 2000, [http://www.freezerbox.com/archive/article.php?id=235 In Memoriam: Action Park], ''Freezerbox''.</ref>\n\nGAR, as its legal troubles would suggest, was accused of cutting corners to maximize its profits. For example, it was accused of building rides cheaply, sporadically maintaining many of them, and failing to renovate rides to take advantage of later safety improvements to its ideas made by other facilities. These practices may have taken place in a range of its operations, including customer safety. For example, in the park's last year, it kept part of the ski area open despite being unable to obtain [[liability insurance]].\n\n===Employees===\n\nThe vast majority of workers at Action Park, at least the ones regularly seen by visitors, were [[teenager]]s. Jim DeSaye, a security director for the park, says he got that job at the age of 21, after having worked at the park for two years. His experience was not uncommon.<ref name=\"Jim DeSaye\">DeSaye, Jim; May 2006; \"From Former Vermin Valley Great Gorge Manager\" in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"; ''Weird NJ'', 29.</ref>\n\nMost were underaged, undertrained, often under the influence of alcohol and cared little for enforcing park rules and safety requirements.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Height- and weight-based restrictions were often ignored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Visitors===\n\nSince it was closer and slightly cheaper than [[Six Flags Great Adventure]], Action Park attracted many visitors from [[Urban area|urban]] enclaves of the New York metropolitan area. Many of them were often from lower-income neighborhoods where they had few, if any, opportunities to swim, much less learn how. The park greatly overestimated these abilities, and this was a factor in many accidents as well as the drownings, according to park officials. DeSaye faults management's decision to broaden the customer base by advertising in [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] media as contributing to the accident rate, since few employees spoke Spanish and no written information was made available in that language.<ref name=\"Jim DeSaye\" />\n\nThe staff's indifference to many of the park's own rules led to a similarly lawless culture among visitors, who generally liked the high level of control they had over their experience. Accidents were usually deemed by park employees to be the fault of the riders. A state official lamented that many water-slide accidents were due to guests who, in blatant violation of an explicitly posted rule, would often discard their mats midway down the slide and wait at a turn for their friends so they could go down together.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nSince many rides routed their lines so that those waiting could see every previous rider, many played to the audience with risque and bawdy behavior when it did finally come to be their turn. The Tarzan Swing in particular was known for outbursts of [[profanity|foul language]] (not always planned) and [[exhibitionism]] as people jumped off the swing in full view of the whole line behind them.<ref name=\"Gethard\" />\n\n=== Availability of alcohol on grounds ===\n\nThe park also sold beer in many [[kiosk]]s on the grounds, with similarly relaxed enforcement of the [[legal drinking age|drinking age]] as with other restrictions in the park. Doctors treating the injured often reported that many of them were intoxicated.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /><ref name=\"Jim DeSaye\" />\n\n===Lax regulatory climate===\n\nDespite many citations for safety violations between 1979 and 1986, including allowing minors to operate some rides and failing to report accidents (which was unique among New Jersey's amusement parks), an investigation by the ''[[New Jersey Herald]]'', Sussex County's main daily newspaper, later found that the park was [[fine (penalty)|fined]] only once. It was also unique in that department in that all other amusement parks were fined for first offenses\u2014except Action Park. It asked if there was some sort of special relationship between GAR and the state.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nSome of the state's regulations failed to adequately address the situation. After the 1987 drowning, it was reported that the Tidal Wave Pool was considered a pool by the state, not a ride. Under state regulations at the time, that meant that the company merely had to keep the water clean and make sure that certified lifeguards were on duty.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\n==Fatalities==\n{{main article|Incidents at independent amusement parks}}\nSix people are known to have died directly or indirectly from rides at Action Park:\n* July 8, 1980: A 19-year-old park employee was riding the Alpine Slide when his car jumped the track and his head struck a rock, killing him.<ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\">{{cite web|title=Water Ride Fatalities 1972\u20131997|url=http://www.rideaccidents.com/water.html|website=rideaccidents.com|accessdate=September 6, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228054418/http://www.rideaccidents.com/water.html|archivedate=February 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* July 24, 1982: A 15-year-old boy drowned in the Tidal Wave Pool.<ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\" /><ref>{{cite news |work=The New York Times |title=Brooklyn Man Drowns in Pool At a Jersey Amusement Park |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DE1038F934A1575BC0A962948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fA%2fAmusement%20and%20Theme%20Parks |accessdate=2006-08-26 |date=August 27, 1984}}</ref>\n* August 1, 1982: A 27-year-old man from [[Long Island]] got out of his tipped [[kayak]] on the Kayak Experience to right it. While doing so, he stepped on a grate that was either in contact with, or came too close to, a section of live [[wire|wiring]] for the underwater fans that somehow became exposed, and he suffered a severe electric shock, which sent him into [[cardiac arrest]]. Several other members of his family nearby were also injured. He was taken to a hospital in nearby [[Warwick (village), New York|Warwick, New York]], where he died later of the shock-induced cardiac arrest.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /><ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\" /> The park at first disputed that the [[electric current]] caused his death, saying there were no [[burn (injury)|burns]] on his body, but the [[coroner]] responded that burns generally do not occur in a water-based [[electrocution]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> The ride was drained and closed for the investigation. Accounts differed as to the extent of the exposed wiring: the park said it was \"just a nick\", while others argued it was closer to {{convert|8|in|cm}}. The state's [[New Jersey Department of Labor|Labor Department]] found that the fan was properly maintained and installed, and cleared the park of wrongdoing; however, it also said that the current had the possibility to cause bodily harm under certain circumstances.<ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\" /> The park claimed it had been vindicated, although it never reopened the ride, saying that people would be afraid to go on it afterwards.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* 1984 (Date Unknown): A fatal heart attack suffered by one visitor was unofficially believed to have been triggered by the shock of the cold water in the pool beneath the Tarzan Swing.

In 2000, Matthew Callan recalled Action Park thusly:\n\n{{cquote|Action Park made adults of a generation of [[Tri-State area]] kids who strolled through its blood-stained gates, by teaching us the truth about life: it is not safe, you will get hurt a lot, and you'll ride all the way home burnt beyond belief.<ref name=\"Callan\" />}}\n\n[[Chris Gethard]], a writer for ''[[Weird NJ]]'' and the associated book series, concurs:\n\n{{cquote|Action Park was a true [[rite of passage]] for any New Jerseyan of my generation.

In its later years, [[Tort|personal injury]] lawsuits led to the closure of increasing numbers of rides, and eventually the entire park closed, in 1996.\n\nOn February 9, 1998, resort developer [[Intrawest]] announced the purchase of the majority of the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, including Action Park and other developable real estate lands that GAR owned.<ref>http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Intrawest+Adds+Ninth+Resort+to+Network-a020216861</ref> The park received a massive overhaul, which included extensively renovating and repairing attractions, especially those deemed either outright unsafe or inappropriate relative to Intrawest's vision of the park, with some being removed entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actionpark.com/3-98.html|title=New Water Park At Vernon Valley Scheduled To Open June 15|website=actionpark.com|access-date=2019-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980425131249/http://www.actionpark.com/3-98.html|archive-date=1998-04-25}}</ref>Afterwards, the park reopened as [[Mountain Creek Waterpark]].\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|footer_align=center|perrow = 1|total_width=200\n| image1 = Action Park (3000196846).jpg | caption1 = Landing at the end of a waterslide\n| image2 = Action Park (3000201136).jpg | caption2 = Mini-slide built into the side of a mountain\n}}\nThe idea for the park began in 1976 when Eugene Mulvihill and his company Great American Recreation (GAR), the owners of the recently combined [[Mountain Creek|Vernon Valley/Great Gorge]] ski area, wanted to find a way to generate revenue during the summer. That year they followed the trend of many other ski areas and opened a {{convert|2700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[alpine slide]] down one of the steep ski trails.<ref>{{cite news|title=So What If There's No Snow, Go Sliding Down Hill Anyway|work=Ocala Star-Banner|date=November 5, 1976|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_o9PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AAYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3698%2C1193697}}</ref>  For the summer of 1978, Mulvihill added two [[water slide]]s and a [[Go-kart|go-kart track]], and named the collection of rides the \"Vernon Valley Summer Park\".<ref>https://archive.org/stream/towntopicsprince3328unse/towntopicsprince3328unse_djvu.txt</ref> The following year, more water slides and a small deep-water swimming pool, as well as tennis courts and a softball field, were added to what became known as the Waterworld section of \"Action Park\". By 1980, Motorworld had been carved out of swampy lands the ski area owned across [[New Jersey Route 94|Route 94]]. Combined, these areas formed one of North America's earliest modern water parks.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/>\n\nUltimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nAction Park's most successful years were the early- and mid-1980s. Most rides were still operating, and the park's dangerous reputation had not yet developed. In 1982, two guests died at the park within a week of each other, leading to the permanent closure of one ride.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sometimes-interesting.com/2014/02/07/there-was-nothing-in-the-world-like-action-park/|title=There was Nothing in the World Like Action park|website=Sometimes-Interesting|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}</ref> Despite this, people continued to come in massive numbers. The park's fortunes began to turn with two deaths in the summer of 1984, and the legal and financial problems that stemmed from the ensuing lawsuits. A state investigation of misconduct in the leasing of state land to Action Park led to a 110-count [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] against the nine related companies that ran the park and their executives for operating an unauthorized [[insurance]] company.<ref name=\"NJ Herald\">McKay, Martha; May 12, 2005; [http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NjkyNjgy Ultimate wine snob] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222234456/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NjkyNjgy |date=December 22, 2007 }}; ''[[New Jersey Herald]]'', retrieved August 27, 2006. </ref> Many took pretrial intervention to avoid prosecution; CEO Eugene Mulvihill pleaded guilty that November to five [[insurance fraud]]-related charges.<ref name=\"state investigation\">New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, date not given,  [http://www.state.nj.us/sci/pdf/hist6.pdf#search=%22%22Eugene%20Mulvihill%22%22 ''Concrete Results: Ensuring Justice, Saving Taxpayers' Money''], 47, retrieved August 27, 2006.</ref>  Still, attendance remained high and the park remained profitable, at least on paper.\n\nThe park entertained over one million visitors per year during the 1980s, with as many as 12,000 coming on some of the busiest weekends.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> Park officials said this made the injury and death rate statistically insignificant.

Former bodybuilders Michael and Vince Mancuso designed the attraction, and the employees that guests would compete against in the jousting matches were found by scouting local gyms.<ref name=\"news.google.com\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9N5QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UukMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1147,6299177&dq=action-park&hl=en|title='Action' fitting name for Northern New Jersey Amusement Park|author=Rice, Bill|date=July 26, 1992|work=The Daily Gazette (Schenectady, NY)}}</ref>  Over the course of a day, there were 3 shows, with the guests that ran the fastest obstacle course times in the earlier shows brought back to compete against each other later in the day.<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/> By 1995 the attraction was removed and replaced with a beach volleyball court.\n\n===Alpine slide===\n[[File:Action Park (2999307425).jpg|thumb|right|Chairlift to alpine slide.]]\nAction Park's {{convert|2700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[alpine slide]] descended the mountain beneath one of the ski area's [[chairlift]]s, which provided guests access to the top of the slide. Riders sat on small sleds that had only a brake/accelerator control stick, and rode down the slide in long chutes built into the slope. The ride, and more specifically the sleds, became notorious for causing injuries. The stick that was supposed to control the sled's speed in practice offered just two options on the infrequently maintained vehicles: extremely slow, and a speed described by one former employee as \"death awaits\".<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> The chutes the sleds traveled in were made of [[concrete]], [[fiberglass]], and [[asbestos]], which led to serious [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] on riders who took even mild falls. The tendency of guests to ride in [[bathing suit]]s made the problem worse. The path underneath the chairlift resulted in verbal harassment and [[expectoration|spitting]] from passengers going up for their turn.<ref name=\"Gethard\">Gethard, Chris; October 2005, \"Brothers in Wounded Arms (And Legs) Serving Together at Action Park,\" ''Weird NJ'', 23.</ref>\n\nThe slide led to the first fatality at the park, a [[head injury]] suffered in 1980 by an employee whose sled ran off the track; he then fell down a embankment and hit his head on a rock, killing him. [[Hay bale]]s at the curves were put in place in an attempt to cushion the impact of guests whose sleds jumped the track, a frequent occurrence. While park officials regularly asserted its safety, in the early years of the park the slide was responsible for the bulk of the accidents, injuries, lawsuits, and state citations for safety violations.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> According to state records, in 1984 and 1985 the alpine slide produced 14 [[Bone fracture|fractures]] and 26 [[head injury|head injuries]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nWhen [[Intrawest]] reopened the water park as [[Mountain Creek Waterpark|Mountain Creek]] in spring 1998, they announced the slide would remain open for one final season. However, riders were required to wear [[helmet]]s and [[kneepad]]s. The last day of the slide's operation was September 6 of that year, the day before the park closed for the season, as that year's [[Labor Day]] was rainy and the slide had to be closed.\n\nThe chutes were torn out afterwards, but the route can still be seen from the [[gondola lift|gondola]] that replaced the chairlift.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />  The resort's mountain bike route travels down the site, and crosses over a few wooden footbridges that provided access over the alpine slide. Mountain Creek recently introduced an [[alpine coaster]], which combines elements of an alpine slide and a roller coaster.\n\n===Snapple Snap-Up Whipper Snapper Ride===\nIn 1991, Action Park opened up a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, two-station [[bungee jumping]] tower near the alpine slide.  The next summer, the tower was upgraded to four jumping stations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&dat=19920726&id=9N5QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UukMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1147,6299177 |title='Action' Fitting Name For Northern New Jersey Amusement Park|work=The Daily Gazette |date=July 26, 1992}}</ref> Guests could not drop very far, however, and were tethered to a weight that prevented them from bouncing back up to the top of the tower. The attraction closed with the park in 1996.\n\n===Skateboard park===\nA [[skatepark]] briefly existed near the ski area's ski school building, but closed after one season due to poor design. Bowls were separated by pavement, which in many cases did not meet the edges smoothly. Former park employee Tom Fergus was quoted in the magazine ''[[Weird NJ]]'' as saying that the \"skate park was responsible for so many injuries we covered it up with dirt and pretended it never existed\".<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\">Fergus, Tom; May 2006; \"Another Action Park Employee Spills His Guts\", in [http://weirdnj.com/stories/action-park/ \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"]; ''Weird NJ'', 29</ref>\n\n===Transmobile===\nThe Transmobile was a [[monorail]] that took riders from the Alpine Center across Route 94 to the Cobblestone Village shopping complex and the park's Motorworld section. Riders would sit sideways in cars built for two people. Each stop had two stations, one for guests heading towards the Alpine Center, and one for guests heading to Motorworld. Rides were one way, and riders were not allowed to stay on the ride and travel round-trip without getting off at either end. This restriction sometimes caused conflicts between park staff and riders who either did not understand or did not want to follow the rules.<ref>http://thecenteroftheaction.blogspot.com/2010/05/showdown-at-transmobile.html</ref>\n\nMuch of the Transmobile was dismantled when Intrawest took over the park in 1998. However, the Cobblestone Village station remains in place, as does the right of way through the Village's [[Miniature golf|mini golf]] course.<ref>http://abnf.co/NJ-action_park.htm</ref>\n\n== Motorworld ==\nAction Park's Motorworld section consisted of rides based around powered vehicles and boats on the west side of [[New Jersey Route 94|Route 94]], opposite the main part of the park. This area closed with Action Park in 1996 and never reopened; they have since been replaced with a [[condominium]] development, a restaurant, and additional parking for the [[Mountain Creek]] ski resort.\n=== Land rides ===\n* '''Super Go Karts''': The Super [[Go-kart|Go Karts]] allowed guests to drive around a small loop [[Race track|track]] at a speed of about {{convert|20|mph|km/h}}, controlled by the [[governor (device)|governor devices]] on the karts. However, park employees knew how to circumvent the governors by wedging [[tennis ball]]s into them, and they were known to do so for guests. As a result, an otherwise standard small-engine kart ride became an opportunity to play [[bumper cars]] at {{cvt|50|mph|km/h}}, and many injuries resulted from [[head-on collision]]s.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> Also, the kart's engines were poorly maintained and some riders were overcome by [[gasoline]] fumes as they drove.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/>\n* '''LOLA Cars''': The LOLA Cars were miniature [[Open wheel car|open-cockpit race cars]] on a longer track. Extra money was charged to drive them, and they, too, could be adjusted for speed by park employees, with similarly harmful consequences to riders.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Former employees have said that, after park management briefly set up a [[microbrewery]] nearby, employees would break into the brewery, steal the beer, and then take the cars out and ride them on Route 94.<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\" />\n* '''Battle Action Tanks''': Battle Action Tanks was one of the most popular rides in Motorworld, and it was featured prominently in television ads. For an additional fee, guests could enter a [[chainlink]] fence-enclosed area and operate small tanks for five minutes at a time. The tanks were equipped with tennis ball cannons that enabled riders to shoot at a [[sensor]] prominently mounted on each tank. If hit, the tank stopped operating for 15 seconds, while other guests often took advantage of the delay to hit the disabled vehicle with more fire. Visitors on the outside could also utilize less-costly cannons mounted on the perimeter fence. When workers had to enter the cage to attend to a stuck or crashed tank, which often happened several times a day, they were commonly pelted with tennis balls, despite prohibitions against such behavior. This gave the ride a reputation for being more dangerous for the employees than the guests,<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> making it one of the least popular places to work in the park. It is not known if there were any serious injuries from the tank ride. As of 2018, the area has not been redeveloped and only a vacant lot remains.\n\n=== Watercraft rides ===\n* '''Super Speedboats''': The Super Speedboats were set up in a small pond, known by park staff to be heavily infested with [[snake]]s.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> They could be driven around a small island at {{cvt|35|-|40|mph|km/h}}. While, unlike the land vehicles, there was no way to tamper and increase their speed, many riders nonetheless used them to play bumper boats, and one seriously inebriated rider had to be rescued by the attendant [[lifeguard]] after his boat [[capsize]]d following a collision.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* '''Bumper Boats''': Bumper Boats was a supposedly safer ride than the Super Speedboats, but the [[engine]]s often leaked [[gasoline]], at least once requiring medical attention for one rider who got too much of it on his [[skin]]. Tall riders also often were unable to fit their legs on the small-sized boats, resulting in them hanging off of the sides of the boats and being fractured during collisions.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\n=== Air rides ===\n* '''Space Shot''': The Space Shot attraction was a tower [[Drop tower|drop ride]], common in many amusement parks. This ride was opened for the park's final season in 1996, and again under [[Mountain Creek]] management in 1998. In July 1998 the ride was purchased by the [[Six Flags]]-owned [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]] theme park in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34601897/|title=CATAPULTED INTO AMUSEMENT PARK HISTORY|work=The Record|location=New Jersey|date=July 24, 1998}}</ref>\n* '''Sling Shot''': Sling Shot was a [[Funtime (manufacturer)|bungee cord ride]] in which two riders sat in a seat and were strapped in while the ride was shot up in the air and supported by a bungee cord. Riders looped upside down. There are a few similar rides still standing in a handful of major amusement parks, the most common name being the Slingshot found at many [[Six Flags]] parks, but they are upcharge attractions (an additional charge to admission) due to insurance issues. At Action Park, the extra fee was only $5. This particular ride was open from 1993 to 1995. \"We often wondered how many [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] cases came out of that ride\", one former employee recalled.<ref name=\"Jersey Ed\" />\n\n== Waterworld ==\n\nWater-based attractions made up half of the park's rides and accounted for the greatest share of its [[Casualty (person)|casualty]] count.  Mountain Creek Waterpark and its currently revived Action Park still operates some of these attractions. In addition, there was also a miniature golf course as well as standard pools and rides for children. These were sometimes smaller, safer versions of the park's main attractions.\n\n=== Cannonball Loop ===\n[[File:Action Park looping water slide.jpg|300px|thumb|right|''Cannonball Loop'', the infamous looping water slide, was only opened for brief periods in Action Park's existence.]]\nIn the mid-1980s GAR built an enclosed water slide, not unusual for that time; in fact, the park already had several such slides. On this one, however, they decided to build a [[Loop (roller coaster)|complete vertical loop]] at the end, similar to that of a roller coaster.<ref name=\"Looping water slide picture\">See picture on [http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/forums/cgi/forum1.cgi?read=153156 this discussion thread]</ref> The resulting slide, called the ''Cannonball Loop'', was so intimidating, that employees have reported they were offered $100 ({{Inflation|US|100|1985|fmt=eq}}) to test it. Fergus, who described himself as \"one of the idiots\" who took the offer, said, \"$100 did not buy enough booze to drown out that memory.\"<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\" />\n\nThe slide was opened for only one month in summer 1985 before it was closed at the order of the state's Advisory Board on Carnival Amusement Ride Safety, a highly unusual move at the time.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> One worker told a local newspaper that \"there were too many bloody noses and back injuries\" from riders, and it was widely rumored, and reported in ''Weird NJ'', that some of the [[crash test dummy|test dummies]] sent down before it opened had been [[dismemberment|dismembered]] and [[decapitation|decapitated]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> A rider also reportedly got stuck at the top of the loop due to insufficient water pressure, and a [[Trapdoor|hatch]] had to be installed at the bottom of the slope to allow for future extractions.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nThe ride supposedly reopened a few more times over the years. In the summers of 1995 and 1996, it was opened for several days before further injuries forced its permanent shutdown.\n\nThose who rode the ''Cannonball Loop'' have said that more safety measures were taken than was otherwise common at the park. Riders were weighed, hosed down with cold water, instructed to remove jewelry, and then carefully instructed in how they had to position their bodies to complete the ride.<ref name=\"Steve Braybrook\">Braybrook, Steve; May 2006; [http://weirdnj.com/stories/action-park/ \"A Survivor from Action Park Writes In\"], in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"; ''Weird NJ'', 29.</ref>\nFor the remainder of the park's existence, ''Cannonball Loop'' remained visible near the entrance of Waterworld. It was dismantled shortly after the park closed.\n\nIn 2014, video footage that appeared to show riders going down the ''Cannonball Loop'' was unearthed and published online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/rare-video-of-people-actually-riding-action-parks-infam-1563953390 |title=Rare Video Of People Actually Riding Action Park's Infamous Water Slide |author=Barry Petchesky |work=The Concourse |accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Other notable water attractions ===\n[[File:Action Park (2999353205).jpg|thumb|right|Less buoyant chlorinated water made the wave pool harder to swim in than salt water in the ocean.]] \n* '''The Tidal Wave Pool''': The first patron death occurred here in 1982; another visitor [[drowning|drowned]] in this common water-park attraction five years later. It was, however, the number of people the [[lifeguard]]s saved from a similar fate that made this the only Waterworld attraction to gain its own nickname, \"The Grave Pool\".<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> It was {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|250|ft|m}} long and could hold 500 to 1,000 people. Waves were generated for 20 minutes at a time with 10-minute intervals between them, and could reach as much as {{convert|40|in|m}} in height.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> It was not always obvious that pool depth increased as one got closer to the far end, and there were patrons who only remembered or realized that they could not [[human swimming|swim]] when they were in over their heads and the waves were going full blast. Even those who could swim sometimes exhausted themselves, causing patrons to crowd the side ladders as the waves began, leading to many accidents.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Twelve lifeguards were on duty at all times, and on high-traffic weekends they were known to rescue as many as 30 people, compared to the one or two the average lifeguard might make in a typical season at a [[swimming pool|pool]] or [[lake]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Mountain Creek continues to operate this attraction as the \"High Tide Wavepool\" but made the pool much shallower.\n* '''Aqua Skoot''': Invented by Ken Bailey in the early 1980s,<ref>http://www.slideshare.net/amusementrides/amusement-rides-by-bailey</ref> riders would carry a hard, solid plastic sled up to the top of the ride, go down a slide consisting of rollers akin to those found in factories, warehouses, or assembly lines, and end up in a pool that in most areas was no deeper than a puddle. The idea of the ride was to, once the sled hit the water, skip across the water like a stone. In order to do this the rider had to be in a certain position, leaned back. If the rider was not in this position, the sled would sink into the water as soon as it hit the pool, flinging the rider off head-first, which often resulted in head injuries. Other times, riders would be leaving the pool only to have others crash into them as they were riding. This ride consisted of parallel slides originally. At some point in the mid 1980s, a third slide was added. Each slide was {{convert|30|ft}} long.<ref>http://articles.mcall.com/1990-07-29/entertainment/2760035_1_water-rides-water-slides-water-park/2</ref> The slides were removed when Intrawest took over the resort in 1998; the pool was redesigned into the Lost Island River which is part of the children's section. The platform / tower riders climbed to ride the Aqua Skoot became the Treetop Cabanas in 2003.\n* '''Kamikaze''': This was the more \"tame\" water slide near the Geronimo slides. It was blue in color and featured several drops and rises. Riders would lie on their backs with their arms and legs crossed and go down a \"chute\" which pitched steeply at first and then went up and down several times before ending in a pool. It survived the Mountain Creek redesign, but was removed and scrapped following the 2009 season.\n* '''The Kayak Experience''': It was an imitation [[whitewater]] course that used submerged electric [[Fan (implement)|fans]] to agitate the water above. Frequently the [[kayak]]s got stuck or tipped over, and people had to get out of them to remedy the situation. In 1982, a man died after trying to get back on his kayak and touching the wiring of the fans, sending him into cardiac arrest and leading to its permanent closure.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /><!---- Former park employee Chris Ish says this was in Waterworld; if his account gets published, this will be included here. ----->\n[[File:Action Park (3000182624).jpg|thumb|right|Taking the Tarzan swing into a cold pool.]]\n* '''The Tarzan Swing''': This was a steel arch hanging from a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Wire rope|cable]] over a [[spring (hydrology)|spring]]-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines for the chance to hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a cushioned area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> In 1984, one man died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after experiencing the swing.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* '''Roaring Rapids''': This was a standard raft-based whitewater ride. Reports that the park filed with the state in 1984 noted fractured [[femur]]s, [[collar bone]]s and [[Human nose|noses]], and [[Dislocation (medicine)|dislocated]] [[knee]]s and [[shoulder]]s. This attraction is still open. The left side is known as The Gauley and riders use a single tube. The right side is known as Thunder Run and is a double tube rafting ride.\n* '''Surf Hill''': This ride, common to other water parks at the time, allowed patrons to slide down a water-slick sloped surface on mats into small puddles, until they reached a foam barrier after an upslope at the end. Barriers between lanes were minimal, and people frequently collided with each other on the way down, or at the end. The seventh lane was known as the \"back breaker\", due to its special kicker two-thirds of the way down intended to allow jumps and splashdowns into a larger puddle.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Employees at the park used to like eating at a nearby [[snack bar]] with a good view of the attraction, since it was almost guaranteed that they could see some serious injuries, lost [[bikini]] tops, or both.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Mountain Creek kept this attraction open through 2005, then reopened it in 2012.\n* '''Super Speed Water Slides''': These two water slides, also known as Geronimo Falls, were set slightly apart from the rest of the park and took advantage of nearly vertical slopes to allow riders to attain higher speeds than usually possible. One started with riders going almost vertically downwards and was covered with screening for the first several feet. As barriers on the side of the slides were very low, lifeguards reminded every user to remain flat on their back with their arms at their side as they descended, since there was no way to ride it otherwise and stay on. The fall from both slides had the potential for very serious injury. Those who made it to the bottom found their progress arrested by water\u2014which made a large splash\u2014and then a small pool. Only one of these slides remains today; however, the track was replaced with one that was not as steep. The tracks the old slides followed are still visible. Today it is known as the H-2-Oh-No. Vertigo and Vortex, two adjacent enclosed tube slides, still use the same end splash pool that two of the other old speed slides used.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* '''Diving cliffs''': The area around Roaring Rapids was (and still is) laid out like a kind of [[grotto]], with many lower-intensity attractions. One was a pair of diving [[cliff]]s\u2014one {{convert|23|ft|m}}, the other {{convert|18|ft|m}}\u2014above a {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} pool. However, the pool below was not blocked off from those who might be swimming in or away from other attractions, and nothing at water level gave any indication to swimmers below that they could expect people to dive in right next to them\u2014or right on top of them. The sole lifeguard on duty often had his or her hands full dealing with the results of those collisions.<ref name=\"Gethard\" /> Also, nonswimmers would jump off the cliffs, not fully appreciating how deep the water below was, and have to be rescued. Former employee Tom Fergus says the bottom of the pool was eventually painted white to make it easier to spot any bodies on the bottom. The large pool into which people jumped is no longer used for regular swimming, only to deposit used tubes.<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\" /> \n[[File:Action Park (2999338931).jpg|thumb|right|Carrying tubes up the mountain.]]\n* '''Colorado River Ride''': The Colorado River Ride, which still exists, is a 2-person raft ride that winds its way down a heavily wooded area on the side of the park, with numerous forks allowing riders to take different routes. Unlike in other parks, the river trough was crafted to look like a natural river bed, with jets in the bed at various points adding to the rapid roughness. Riders carried their rafts from the bottom of the ride up to the starting point. Once on the ride, riders would travel down a short incline, propelling them down the ride. As they make it past the first turn, it was common to gain speed. After a few turns, the riders would come to a fork.\n** '''The Main Fork''': Riders would ride under a drenching waterfall into a dark tunnel with many twists, turns, and jagged rocks. Upon exiting the tunnel, riders would twist and turn some more until they reached a small rock pool, and slowly floated out. The final stretch of the river consisted of a large downhill portion complete with bumps, and a {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=mid|-high}} jump where the rafts would momentarily catch air and then slam back onto the surface.\n** '''The Alternative Forks''': Riders would float along a relatively smooth path until they rounded a corner with a waterfall,<ref>1991 footage of Action Park (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xXcQdVr1Zg</ref> and another fork. One path would take riders back to the main path, and dump them at the tunnel's end. The other fork would reconnect with the main path before the rock pool.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">Mountain Creek Colorado River Ride footage from 2013 showing both points where the alternative pathways reconnected with the main path of the ride. (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyiD_lk-4Fk</ref> Originally, a fork carried riders down a set of steep drops, before a curved drop into the main path right at the end.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">1987 footage of Action Park (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iJoL1Q9FY</ref> In the late 1980s, this path was merged into the main pathway, creating the rock pool, and final hill, that are still in use today. Today, the first fork is closed off, but the points where the forks reconnect to the main path are still connected to the ride.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n: Originally, riders rode this attraction two at a time, in yellow inflatable [[dinghy|dinghies]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This was later replaced with large circular four-person rafts. In the [[Mountain Creek]] era, a lift was put in place that carried rafts to the beginning of the ride, eliminating the need for riders to carry them all the way up the hill. Because the ride trough was designed to look and feel like actual river bed, the ride was rough. It was not uncommon for people to hit heads with the other riders, or for the rafts to climb the walls after hitting them at high speed, so now they wear football helmets. A rider recounted to ''[[Weird NJ]]'' how a friend's mother suffered a broken nose when their raft was thrown into a rock wall.<ref name=\"Greg Shpunder\">Shpunder, Greg; May 2006; \"Action Park Designed to Hurt People\" in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"; ''Weird NJ'', 28.</ref> On the curve before the first fork, it was common for rafts to get stuck \u2013 requiring riders to have to jump out, and push the raft \u2013 or wait for the raft behind them to hit them.<ref>More Action Park footage from 1991 (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz2gxQGF1Wc</ref> Inside the tunnel were jagged rocks, which could cause cuts or scrapes if riders placed their hands out.\n\n===The Aerodium===\nThe Aerodium is a skydiving simulator wind tunnel invented in Germany in 1984. In 1987, Action Park built and opened their own Aerodium in the Waterworld section of the park, becoming the first American amusement park to open an Aerodium. The attraction was operated by Aerodium Inc., who would act as a concessionaire for the park through 1997.<ref>http://www.aerodium.com/general_information.htm</ref> Stadium seating encircled the perimeter of the Aerodium, allowing friends and spectators to watch riders fly. Riders wearing a special skydiving suit, helmet, and earplugs would join the [[bodyflight]] instructor one by one on a trampoline-like netting directly over the fan. The instructor would grab each rider's wrists and guide the rider to fall forward, allowing the fan to lift the rider skyward. After a few seconds of flight, the attendant operating the fan would cut the power, causing the rider to fall onto the air cushions surrounding the fan. Park guests' flights were limited to a maximum of {{convert|6|or|7|ft|m}} above the ground, approximately {{convert|1|to|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} over the instructor's head. The Aerodium also caused severe injuries, for example, when a rider instinctively tried to break his fall by extending his arm, which caused shoulder dislocation, severed nerves, and near-permanent paralysis of the arm.\n\n==Factors contributing to the park's safety record==\n\nA range of factors contributed to accidents at the park, from the design and construction of the rides themselves to the makeup of both visitors and staff, and lax government oversight.\n\n===Ride design===\n\nAction Park and its defenders often pointed out that it was one of the first water parks in the nation and thus pioneered ideas that were later widely copied. This meant that visitors were using rides that had not been tested through practical use for very long.  Ride designers may have had insufficient training in [[physics]] or [[engineering]]. \"They seemed to build rides,\" one attendee recalled, \"not knowing how they would work, and [then let] people on them.\"<ref name=\"Callan\">Callan, Matthew; November 22, 2000, [http://www.freezerbox.com/archive/article.php?id=235 In Memoriam: Action Park], ''Freezerbox''.</ref>\n\nGAR, as its legal troubles would suggest, was accused of cutting corners to maximize its profits. For example, it was accused of building rides cheaply, sporadically maintaining many of them, and failing to renovate rides to take advantage of later safety improvements to its ideas made by other facilities. These practices may have taken place in a range of its operations, including customer safety. For example, in the park's last year, it kept part of the ski area open despite being unable to obtain [[liability insurance]].\n\n===Employees===\n\nThe vast majority of workers at Action Park, at least the ones regularly seen by visitors, were [[teenager]]s. Jim DeSaye, a security director for the park, says he got that job at the age of 21, after having worked at the park for two years. His experience was not uncommon.<ref name=\"Jim DeSaye\">DeSaye, Jim; May 2006; \"From Former Vermin Valley Great Gorge Manager\" in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"; ''Weird NJ'', 29.</ref>\n\nMost were underaged, undertrained, often under the influence of alcohol and cared little for enforcing park rules and safety requirements.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Height- and weight-based restrictions were often ignored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Visitors===\n\nSince it was closer and slightly cheaper than [[Six Flags Great Adventure]], Action Park attracted many visitors from [[Urban area|urban]] enclaves of the New York metropolitan area. Many of them were often from lower-income neighborhoods where they had few, if any, opportunities to swim, much less learn how. The park greatly overestimated these abilities, and this was a factor in many accidents as well as the drownings, according to park officials. DeSaye faults management's decision to broaden the customer base by advertising in [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] media as contributing to the accident rate, since few employees spoke Spanish and no written information was made available in that language.<ref name=\"Jim DeSaye\" />\n\nThe staff's indifference to many of the park's own rules led to a similarly lawless culture among visitors, who generally liked the high level of control they had over their experience. Accidents were usually deemed by park employees to be the fault of the riders. A state official lamented that many water-slide accidents were due to guests who, in blatant violation of an explicitly posted rule, would often discard their mats midway down the slide and wait at a turn for their friends so they could go down together.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nSince many rides routed their lines so that those waiting could see every previous rider, many played to the audience with risque and bawdy behavior when it did finally come to be their turn. The Tarzan Swing in particular was known for outbursts of [[profanity|foul language]] (not always planned) and [[exhibitionism]] as people jumped off the swing in full view of the whole line behind them.<ref name=\"Gethard\" />\n\n=== Availability of alcohol on grounds ===\n\nThe park also sold beer in many [[kiosk]]s on the grounds, with similarly relaxed enforcement of the [[legal drinking age|drinking age]] as with other restrictions in the park. Doctors treating the injured often reported that many of them were intoxicated.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /><ref name=\"Jim DeSaye\" />\n\n===Lax regulatory climate===\n\nDespite many citations for safety violations between 1979 and 1986, including allowing minors to operate some rides and failing to report accidents (which was unique among New Jersey's amusement parks), an investigation by the ''[[New Jersey Herald]]'', Sussex County's main daily newspaper, later found that the park was [[fine (penalty)|fined]] only once. It was also unique in that department in that all other amusement parks were fined for first offenses\u2014except Action Park. It asked if there was some sort of special relationship between GAR and the state.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nSome of the state's regulations failed to adequately address the situation. After the 1987 drowning, it was reported that the Tidal Wave Pool was considered a pool by the state, not a ride. Under state regulations at the time, that meant that the company merely had to keep the water clean and make sure that certified lifeguards were on duty.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\n==Fatalities==\n{{main article|Incidents at independent amusement parks}}\nSix people are known to have died directly or indirectly from rides at Action Park:\n* July 8, 1980: A 19-year-old park employee was riding the Alpine Slide when his car jumped the track and his head struck a rock, killing him.<ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\">{{cite web|title=Water Ride Fatalities 1972\u20131997|url=http://www.rideaccidents.com/water.html|website=rideaccidents.com|accessdate=September 6, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228054418/http://www.rideaccidents.com/water.html|archivedate=February 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* July 24, 1982: A 15-year-old boy drowned in the Tidal Wave Pool.<ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\" /><ref>{{cite news |work=The New York Times |title=Brooklyn Man Drowns in Pool At a Jersey Amusement Park |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DE1038F934A1575BC0A962948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fA%2fAmusement%20and%20Theme%20Parks |accessdate=2006-08-26 |date=August 27, 1984}}</ref>\n* August 1, 1982: A 27-year-old man from [[Long Island]] got out of his tipped [[kayak]] on the Kayak Experience to right it. While doing so, he stepped on a grate that was either in contact with, or came too close to, a section of live [[wire|wiring]] for the underwater fans that somehow became exposed, and he suffered a severe electric shock, which sent him into [[cardiac arrest]]. Several other members of his family nearby were also injured. He was taken to a hospital in nearby [[Warwick (village), New York|Warwick, New York]], where he died later of the shock-induced cardiac arrest.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /><ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\" /> The park at first disputed that the [[electric current]] caused his death, saying there were no [[burn (injury)|burns]] on his body, but the [[coroner]] responded that burns generally do not occur in a water-based [[electrocution]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> The ride was drained and closed for the investigation. Accounts differed as to the extent of the exposed wiring: the park said it was \"just a nick\", while others argued it was closer to {{convert|8|in|cm}}.

In 2000, Matthew Callan recalled Action Park thusly:\n\n{{cquote|Action Park made adults of a generation of [[Tri-State area]] kids who strolled through its blood-stained gates, by teaching us the truth about life: it is not safe, you will get hurt a lot, and you'll ride all the way home burnt beyond belief.<ref name=\"Callan\" />}}\n\n[[Chris Gethard]], a writer for ''[[Weird NJ]]'' and the associated book series, concurs:\n\n{{cquote|Action Park was a true [[rite of passage]] for any New Jerseyan of my generation. When I get to talking about it with other Jerseyans, we share stories as if we are veterans who served in combat together. I suspect that many of us may have come closest to death on some of those rides up in Vernon Valley. I consider it a true shame that future generations will never know the terror of proving their grit at New Jersey's most dangerous amusement park.<ref name=\"Gethard\" />}}\n\nOn August 1, 1993, MTV's ''[[Headbanger's Ball]]'' taped an episode at the park.
