Having realized the aircraft was not lined-up properly relative to the runway, the crew reported to the [[Air traffic controller|ATC]] and started to [[go-around]] using the [[Takeoff/Go-around switches|TOGA]] (Take Off / Go Around) mode. One of the two [[autopilot]]s, which was active during the final approach, has been switched off and the flight was being controlled manually.\n\nThe engines reached thrust level close to full. The crew retracted the [[flaps (aircraft)|flaps]] from 30 degrees to 15 degrees position.\n\nAffected by the upturn moment generated by the engine thrust, the aircraft started to [[climb (aeronautics)|climb]], reaching the [[Flight dynamics|pitch angle]] of about 25 degrees. [[Indicated airspeed]] has started to decrease. The crew retracted the [[landing gear]]. Since initiating the go-around maneuver up to this moment the crew did not perform control actions through the [[Yoke (aircraft)|yoke]].\n\nAfter the airspeed decreased from 150 to 125 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], the crew started control actions through the yoke, pitching nose down, which has led to stopping climb then starting descent and increase of the airspeed. Maximum [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] have not exceeded operational limits during the flight.\n\nAfter reaching the [[Altitude#Altitude in aviation and in spaceflight|altitude]] of 700 meters, the aircraft started a steep nosedive, with the pitch angle reaching \u221275\u00b0 by the end of the flight (end of the recording).\n\nThe aircraft collided with terrain at high speed (exceeding 450&nbsp;km/h) and with highly negative pitch angle.\n\nAbout 45 seconds have passed between the moment of starting go-around maneuver and the moment the recording stopped, the descent took about 20 seconds.\n\nThe propulsion systems were operating up to the collision with terrain. No single commands have been detected by the preliminary analysis, which would indicate failures of systems or units of the aircraft or [[Turbine engine failure|engines]].\n</blockquote>\n\nOn 24 December 2015, the IAC released their final report stating that the crash was caused by an under-qualified crew who lacked the skills to recover from an excessive nose up attitude during a go-around procedure.  The go-around was necessitated by a positional error in the navigation system, a map drift. The pilots\u2019 deficiencies were caused by lack of airline safety management and lack of regulators\u2019 oversight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/30a/report_vq-bbn.pdf|title=Archived copy|publisher=Interstate Aviation Comittee|language=Russian|trans-title=Final report|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6g80WVPVQ?url=http://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/dc4/report_vq-bbn.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=2016-01-17|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/459/report_vq-bbn_eng.pdf|title=Final report|publisher=Interstate Aviation Comittee|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://avherald.com/h?article=46b9ecbc/0022&opt=7680|title=Crash: Tatarstan B735 at Kazan on Nov 17th 2013, crashed on go-around|website=avherald.com|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the final report, during the final approach the crew initiated a [[go-around]], but being under high [[workload]], which possibly caused a \"[[tunnel vision]] effect\", they did not perceive warning messages related to auto-pilot disconnection. When the plane climbed to 700 m, its pitch angle reached 25 degrees and the airspeed dropped to 230&nbsp;km/h. At that moment the captain, who had not performed a go-around outside of training, moved the yoke, pitching nose down, which led to stopping climb and started a descent and increase of the aircraft's airspeed. After reaching the altitude of 700 m, the aircraft started a steep nosedive, with the pitch angle reaching \u221275\u00b0 when the aircraft impacted the ground. The plane crashed on the airport's runway with a speed exceeding 450&nbsp;km/h. The time from the start of the go-around maneuver until the impact was about 45 seconds, including 20 seconds of aircraft descent.\n\n=== Alternative opinion report ===\n\nNikolay Studenikin, the official representative of the [[Federal Air Transport Agency|Rosaviatsiya]] in the air accident investigation commission, filed an alternative opinion report, in which he expressed his disagreement with the conclusions of the commission.<ref name=alternative>{{cite web |first=Nikolay |last=Studenikin |url=http://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/6e0/\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435%20\u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.PDF |script-title=ru:\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 |trans-title=Alternative opinion of the Rosaviatsiya representative  |accessdate=27 March 2016 |publisher=[[Interstate Aviation Committee]] |language=ru }}</ref>\n\nIn it he stated that the IAC commission concentrated the investigation on the search of the shortcomings in the flight crew training in Russia, and that no direct connection between such shortcomings and the Flight 363 crash was actually established. He also criticized, that the investigation into the possible malfunction of the aircraft's [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]]' controls was entrusted to their manufacturer, the US-based [[Parker Hannifin|Parker Aerospace]], which ruled that their controls operated normally during the accident.

Based on information obtained during the investigation, Salichov was lacking sufficient piloting skills and was granted piloting on a basis of falsified documents...\n\n\nOn 19 November 2013, the Investigation Board of the IAC reported the following preliminary details after recovering some information from the flight data recorder:<ref>[https://mak-iac.org/rassledovaniya/17-noyabrya-boing-737-500-vq-bbn/ Interstate Aviation Committee.

Having realized the aircraft was not lined-up properly relative to the runway, the crew reported to the [[Air traffic controller|ATC]] and started to [[go-around]] using the [[Takeoff/Go-around switches|TOGA]] (Take Off / Go Around) mode. One of the two [[autopilot]]s, which was active during the final approach, has been switched off and the flight was being controlled manually.\n\nThe engines reached thrust level close to full. The crew retracted the [[flaps (aircraft)|flaps]] from 30 degrees to 15 degrees position.\n\nAffected by the upturn moment generated by the engine thrust, the aircraft started to [[climb (aeronautics)|climb]], reaching the [[Flight dynamics|pitch angle]] of about 25 degrees. [[Indicated airspeed]] has started to decrease. The crew retracted the [[landing gear]]. Since initiating the go-around maneuver up to this moment the crew did not perform control actions through the [[Yoke (aircraft)|yoke]].\n\nAfter the airspeed decreased from 150 to 125 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], the crew started control actions through the yoke, pitching nose down, which has led to stopping climb then starting descent and increase of the airspeed. Maximum [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] have not exceeded operational limits during the flight.\n\nAfter reaching the [[Altitude#Altitude in aviation and in spaceflight|altitude]] of 700 meters, the aircraft started a steep nosedive, with the pitch angle reaching \u221275\u00b0 by the end of the flight (end of the recording).\n\nThe aircraft collided with terrain at high speed (exceeding 450&nbsp;km/h) and with highly negative pitch angle.\n\nAbout 45 seconds have passed between the moment of starting go-around maneuver and the moment the recording stopped, the descent took about 20 seconds.\n\nThe propulsion systems were operating up to the collision with terrain. No single commands have been detected by the preliminary analysis, which would indicate failures of systems or units of the aircraft or [[Turbine engine failure|engines]].\n</blockquote>\n\nOn 24 December 2015, the IAC released their final report stating that the crash was caused by an under-qualified crew who lacked the skills to recover from an excessive nose up attitude during a go-around procedure.  The go-around was necessitated by a positional error in the navigation system, a map drift. The pilots\u2019 deficiencies were caused by lack of airline safety management and lack of regulators\u2019 oversight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/30a/report_vq-bbn.pdf|title=Archived copy|publisher=Interstate Aviation Comittee|language=Russian|trans-title=Final report|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6g80WVPVQ?url=http://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/dc4/report_vq-bbn.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=2016-01-17|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/459/report_vq-bbn_eng.pdf|title=Final report|publisher=Interstate Aviation Comittee|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://avherald.com/h?article=46b9ecbc/0022&opt=7680|title=Crash: Tatarstan B735 at Kazan on Nov 17th 2013, crashed on go-around|website=avherald.com|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the final report, during the final approach the crew initiated a [[go-around]], but being under high [[workload]], which possibly caused a \"[[tunnel vision]] effect\", they did not perceive warning messages related to auto-pilot disconnection. When the plane climbed to 700 m, its pitch angle reached 25 degrees and the airspeed dropped to 230&nbsp;km/h. At that moment the captain, who had not performed a go-around outside of training, moved the yoke, pitching nose down, which led to stopping climb and started a descent and increase of the aircraft's airspeed. After reaching the altitude of 700 m, the aircraft started a steep nosedive, with the pitch angle reaching \u221275\u00b0 when the aircraft impacted the ground. The plane crashed on the airport's runway with a speed exceeding 450&nbsp;km/h. The time from the start of the go-around maneuver until the impact was about 45 seconds, including 20 seconds of aircraft descent.\n\n=== Alternative opinion report ===\n\nNikolay Studenikin, the official representative of the [[Federal Air Transport Agency|Rosaviatsiya]] in the air accident investigation commission, filed an alternative opinion report, in which he expressed his disagreement with the conclusions of the commission.<ref name=alternative>{{cite web |first=Nikolay |last=Studenikin |url=http://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/6e0/\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435%20\u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.PDF |script-title=ru:\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 |trans-title=Alternative opinion of the Rosaviatsiya representative  |accessdate=27 March 2016 |publisher=[[Interstate Aviation Committee]] |language=ru }}</ref>\n\nIn it he stated that the IAC commission concentrated the investigation on the search of the shortcomings in the flight crew training in Russia, and that no direct connection between such shortcomings and the Flight 363 crash was actually established. He also criticized, that the investigation into the possible malfunction of the aircraft\u2019s [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]]' controls was entrusted to their manufacturer, the US-based [[Parker Hannifin|Parker Aerospace]], which ruled that their controls operated normally during the accident. According to Studenikin, a flight simulation of the crashed flight, which was conducted on the [[Boeing]] facilities, was aimed only on proving the crew's fault and didn't simulate a possible mechanical failure in the Boeing aircraft.<ref name=alternative/>\n\n=== Aircraft certificate suspension ===\n\n[[Federal Air Transport Agency|Rosaviatsiya]] refused to accept the results of the IAC's Flight 363 accident investigation, citing their concern over the Boeing 737's [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]]' controls.<ref name=\"BBC Russian 6 Nov\"/> IAC accused Rosaviatsiya, that their position is actually caused by the reluctance to accept the shortcomings of Rosaviatsiya's regulatory oversight of pilots training in Russia, which was revealed in the report. On 4 November 2015, IAC unexpectedly announced the suspension of Boeing 737 flying certificates in Russia, explaining it by Rosaviatsiya's refusal to accept the absence of safety issues with 737 elevators' controls.<ref name=\"BBC Russian 5 Nov\">{{cite web |date=5 November 2015 |url=http://www.bbc.com/russian/news/2015/11/151105_russia_bans_737s |title=\u041c\u0410\u041a \u0437\u0430\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b \u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 Boeing-737 |trans-title=IAC announced the suspension of the Boeing 737 certificates |accessdate=27 March 2016 |work=[[BBC Russian Service]] |language=ru}}</ref>\n\nWith the Boeing 737 being a work-horse of several Russian airlines, the suspension meant that within days the significant part of the country's passenger fleet could be grounded for an uncertain period of time.
