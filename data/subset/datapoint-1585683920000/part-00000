They are constituted under the [[Local Government Act 1992]], which amended the [[Local Government Act 1972]] to allow the existence of counties that do not have multiple districts. They typically allow large towns to have separate local authorities from the less urbanised parts of their counties and provide a single authority for small counties where division into districts would be impractical. Unitary authorities do not cover all of England. Most were [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|established during the 1990s]] and a further tranche were [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|created in 2009]]. Unitary authorities have the powers and functions that are elsewhere separately administered by councils of [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]] and the [[non-metropolitan district]]s within them.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nThe term \"[[unitary authority]]\" was first used in the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] in 1969 in its current sense of a local government authority which combines the functions of a county council and a district council.<ref>[[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] I. vi 73, cited in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Online, draft addendum February 2003, s.v. ''unitary''.  An earlier citation, in 1936, uses the term for the [[London County Council]] in the sense of an elected council for the whole of London.</ref> Strictly speaking, the term does not necessarily mean a single level of local government within an area, because in some cases there are also [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]] in the same area.\n\nAlthough the term was not applied to them, [[county borough]]s between 1889 and 1974 were effectively unitary authorities, that is, single-tier administrative units.  Before 1889, local government authorities had different powers and functions, but from medieval times some cities and towns had a high degree of autonomy as [[county corporate|counties corporate]].  Some smaller settlements also enjoyed some degree of autonomy from regular administration as [[borough]]s or [[Liberty (division)|liberties]].\n\nThe [[Local Government Act 1972]] created areas for local government where large towns and their rural hinterlands were administered together. The concept of unitary units was abandoned with a two-tier arrangement of county and district councils in all areas of England, except the [[Isles of Scilly]] where the small size and distance from the mainland made it impractical. In 1986 a broadly unitary system of local government was introduced in the six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] and [[Greater London]], where the upper-tier authorities were abolished and their functions were split between central government, the borough councils and joint boards.<ref name=atkinson>{{ cite book |author1=Atkinson, H.  |author2=Wilks-Heeg, S.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Local Government from Thatcher to Blair | year=2000 | publisher=Polity}}</ref>\n\n===1990s reform===\n{{main|Local Government Commission for England (1992)}}\nA review in the 1990s was initiated to select non-metropolitan areas where new unitary authorities could be created.<ref name=politics_uk>{{ cite book | title=Politics UK | year=2004 | publisher=Pearson | edition=5th | author= Jones, Kavanagh, Moran & Norton}}</ref> The resulting structural changes were implemented between 1995 and 1998. Bristol, Herefordshire, the Isle of Wight and Rutland were established as counties of a single district; the district councils of Berkshire became unitary; the counties of Avon, Humberside and Cleveland were broken up to create several unitary authorities; and a number of districts were split off from their associated counties.<ref name=atkinson/> The changes caused the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] to be defined separately, as they had been before 1974. The review caused 46 unitary authorities to be created.<ref name=atkinson/>\n\n===2009 changes===\n{{main|2009 structural changes to local government in England}}\nA further review was initiated in 2007 and was enacted in 2009. The review established Cornwall and Northumberland as counties of a single district; established unitary authorities in County Durham, Shropshire and Wiltshire covering the part of the county that was not already split off in the 1990s review; and divided the remainder of Bedfordshire and Cheshire into two unitary authorities. The review caused nine unitary authorities to be created.\n\n===Further reform===\n{{Seealso|2019/2020 structural changes to local government in England}}\n\nIn 2016, Oxfordshire County Council put forward a 'One Oxfordshire' proposal which would see Oxford City Council and the four other district councils in Oxfordshire abolished and replaced with a single unitary county council for Oxfordshire. In 2017, Oxford City Council voiced their opposition to the proposal. A decision on whether the proposal will go ahead was to have been announced in March 2017.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn 2017, it was proposed that two unitary authorities be formed to cover the ceremonial county of [[Dorset]]. One of the authorities would consist of the existing unitary authorities of [[Borough of Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], [[Borough of Poole|Poole]] and the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], the other would be composed of the remainder of the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/|title=Future Dorset - Two new authorities for Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref> In November 2017, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, [[Sajid Javid]] stated that he was \"minded to approve the proposals\" and a final decision to implement the two unitary authority model was confirmed in February 2018. Statutory instruments for the creation of two unitary authorities, to be named [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council]] and [[Dorset Council (UK)|Dorset Council]], have been made and shadow authorities for the new council areas were formed ahead of their [[2019_structural_changes_to_local_government_in_England|creation on 1 April 2019]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2018/9780111168134/contents|title=The Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole (Structural Changes) Order 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dorsetareacouncils.wordpress.com/|title=Shadow Dorset Council|website=Shadow Dorset Council|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] and the non-metropolitan districts of [[Aylesbury Vale]], [[Chiltern District|Chiltern]], [[South Bucks]], and [[Wycombe District|Wycombe]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] were replaced by a single unitary authority known as [[Buckinghamshire Council]] on 1 April 2020. The existing unitary authority of [[Borough of Milton Keynes|Milton Keynes]] was not affected; from  1 April 2020, therefore, the ceremonial county of [[Buckinghamshire]] has been composed of two unitary authorities.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-46078569 Buckinghamshire unitary council plan gets go-ahead] from [[BBC News]]</ref><ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/957/contents/made The Buckinghamshire (Structural Changes) Order 2019]</ref>\n\nIn March 2018, an independent report commissioned by the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, proposed structural changes to local government in [[Northamptonshire]]. These changes would see the existing county council and district councils abolished and two new unitary authorities created in their place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-40610349|title=Troubled council 'should be scrapped'|date=15 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> One authority would consist of the existing districts of [[Daventry District|Daventry]], [[Northampton]] and [[South Northamptonshire]] and the other authority would consist of [[Corby (borough)|Corby]], [[East Northamptonshire]], [[Borough of Kettering|Kettering]] and [[Borough of Wellingborough|Wellingborough]] districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2018-03-15/northamptonshire-county-council-should-be-split-up-finds-damning-report/|title=Northamptonshire County Council 'should be split up', finds damning report|website=itv.com|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Functions==\nUnitary authorities combine the powers and functions that are normally delivered separately by the councils of non-metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan districts. These functions are housing, waste management, waste collection, council tax collection, education, libraries, social services, transport, planning, consumer protection, licensing, cemeteries and crematoria. The breakdown of these services is as follows:<ref>Frequently Asked Questions on the structural reviews of Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk, Boundary Commission for England</ref>\n\n{{Non-metropolitan local authority functions}}\n\n==Electoral arrangements==\nMost unitary authorities are divided into a number of multiple member [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] from which councillors are elected in the same way as in two-tier district council elections. The exceptions, which are divided into electoral divisions as in county council elections, are Cornwall, County Durham, the Isle of Wight, Northumberland, Shropshire and Wiltshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/help.html|title=Help using the election maps apps|website=openspace.ordnancesurvey.co.uk|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Current list==\nMost unitary authorities are legally defined as being coterminous non-metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan districts run by a single council. While it makes no difference, they can either be run by a county council that additionally has district powers and functions, or a district council that additionally has county powers and functions. If there's a county council, the district has no council, and vice versa. Districts can additionally have the status of [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] or [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], although this has no effect on their powers or functions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

On the other hand, the [[City of London Corporation]] and the 32 [[London borough]] councils, although they have a high degree of autonomy, share strategic functions with the directly elected [[Mayor of London]] and [[London Assembly]].\n\n==Combined authorities==\nUnitary authorities should not be confused with another formation in English local government, the [[combined authority]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Local government in England]]\n* [[History of local government in England]]\n* [[List of unitary authorities of England]] by population\n* [[Political make-up of local councils in the United Kingdom#Unitary authorities|Political make-up of unitary authorities in England]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Unitary authorities of England}}\n{{Administrative geography of the United Kingdom}}\n{{Subdivisions of England}}\n\n[[Category:Unitary authorities of England| ]]\n[[Category:Local government in England]]\n[[Category:England geography-related lists]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=February 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox subdivision type\n| map=              [[File:English unitary authorities 2020.svg|thumb|]]\n| name=             Unitary authority\n| alt_name=          \n| category=          [[Districts of England|Local authority districts]]\n| territory=         England\n| upper_unit=        [[Regions of England|Regions]]\n| current_number=    56\n| number_date=       2020\n| legislation_begin= \n| start_date=        \n| start_date1=       \n| population_range=  40,000\u2013500,000\n| area_range=        \n| exofficio =           \n| type1=             \n| type2=             \n| type3=             \n| status=           Coterminous [[Non-metropolitan county]] and [[Non-metropolitan district]] (45)\n| status1=          District of [[Berkshire]] (6)\n| status2=          \n| status3=            \n}}\n'''Unitary authorities of England''' are [[local government|local authorities]] that are responsible for the provision of all [[Local government in England|local government services]] within a district. They are constituted under the [[Local Government Act 1992]], which amended the [[Local Government Act 1972]] to allow the existence of counties that do not have multiple districts. They typically allow large towns to have separate local authorities from the less urbanised parts of their counties and provide a single authority for small counties where division into districts would be impractical. Unitary authorities do not cover all of England. Most were [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|established during the 1990s]] and a further tranche were [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|created in 2009]]. Unitary authorities have the powers and functions that are elsewhere separately administered by councils of [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]] and the [[non-metropolitan district]]s within them.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nThe term \"[[unitary authority]]\" was first used in the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] in 1969 in its current sense of a local government authority which combines the functions of a county council and a district council.<ref>[[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] I. vi 73, cited in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Online, draft addendum February 2003, s.v. ''unitary''.  An earlier citation, in 1936, uses the term for the [[London County Council]] in the sense of an elected council for the whole of London.</ref> Strictly speaking, the term does not necessarily mean a single level of local government within an area, because in some cases there are also [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]] in the same area.\n\nAlthough the term was not applied to them, [[county borough]]s between 1889 and 1974 were effectively unitary authorities, that is, single-tier administrative units.  Before 1889, local government authorities had different powers and functions, but from medieval times some cities and towns had a high degree of autonomy as [[county corporate|counties corporate]].  Some smaller settlements also enjoyed some degree of autonomy from regular administration as [[borough]]s or [[Liberty (division)|liberties]].\n\nThe [[Local Government Act 1972]] created areas for local government where large towns and their rural hinterlands were administered together. The concept of unitary units was abandoned with a two-tier arrangement of county and district councils in all areas of England, except the [[Isles of Scilly]] where the small size and distance from the mainland made it impractical. In 1986 a broadly unitary system of local government was introduced in the six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] and [[Greater London]], where the upper-tier authorities were abolished and their functions were split between central government, the borough councils and joint boards.<ref name=atkinson>{{ cite book |author1=Atkinson, H.  |author2=Wilks-Heeg, S.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Local Government from Thatcher to Blair | year=2000 | publisher=Polity}}</ref>\n\n===1990s reform===\n{{main|Local Government Commission for England (1992)}}\nA review in the 1990s was initiated to select non-metropolitan areas where new unitary authorities could be created.<ref name=politics_uk>{{ cite book | title=Politics UK | year=2004 | publisher=Pearson | edition=5th | author= Jones, Kavanagh, Moran & Norton}}</ref> The resulting structural changes were implemented between 1995 and 1998. Bristol, Herefordshire, the Isle of Wight and Rutland were established as counties of a single district; the district councils of Berkshire became unitary; the counties of Avon, Humberside and Cleveland were broken up to create several unitary authorities; and a number of districts were split off from their associated counties.<ref name=atkinson/> The changes caused the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] to be defined separately, as they had been before 1974. The review caused 46 unitary authorities to be created.<ref name=atkinson/>\n\n===2009 changes===\n{{main|2009 structural changes to local government in England}}\nA further review was initiated in 2007 and was enacted in 2009. The review established Cornwall and Northumberland as counties of a single district; established unitary authorities in County Durham, Shropshire and Wiltshire covering the part of the county that was not already split off in the 1990s review; and divided the remainder of Bedfordshire and Cheshire into two unitary authorities. The review caused nine unitary authorities to be created.\n\n===Further reform===\n{{Seealso|2019/2020 structural changes to local government in England}}\n\nIn 2016, Oxfordshire County Council put forward a 'One Oxfordshire' proposal which would see Oxford City Council and the four other district councils in Oxfordshire abolished and replaced with a single unitary county council for Oxfordshire. In 2017, Oxford City Council voiced their opposition to the proposal. A decision on whether the proposal will go ahead was to have been announced in March 2017.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn 2017, it was proposed that two unitary authorities be formed to cover the ceremonial county of [[Dorset]]. One of the authorities would consist of the existing unitary authorities of [[Borough of Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], [[Borough of Poole|Poole]] and the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], the other would be composed of the remainder of the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/|title=Future Dorset - Two new authorities for Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref> In November 2017, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, [[Sajid Javid]] stated that he was \"minded to approve the proposals\" and a final decision to implement the two unitary authority model was confirmed in February 2018. Statutory instruments for the creation of two unitary authorities, to be named [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council]] and [[Dorset Council (UK)|Dorset Council]], have been made and shadow authorities for the new council areas were formed ahead of their [[2019_structural_changes_to_local_government_in_England|creation on 1 April 2019]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2018/9780111168134/contents|title=The Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole (Structural Changes) Order 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dorsetareacouncils.wordpress.com/|title=Shadow Dorset Council|website=Shadow Dorset Council|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] and the non-metropolitan districts of [[Aylesbury Vale]], [[Chiltern District|Chiltern]], [[South Bucks]], and [[Wycombe District|Wycombe]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] were replaced by a single unitary authority known as [[Buckinghamshire Council]] on 1 April 2020. The existing unitary authority of [[Borough of Milton Keynes|Milton Keynes]] was not affected; from  1 April 2020, therefore, the ceremonial county of [[Buckinghamshire]] has been composed of two unitary authorities.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-46078569 Buckinghamshire unitary council plan gets go-ahead] from [[BBC News]]</ref><ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/957/contents/made The Buckinghamshire (Structural Changes) Order 2019]</ref>\n\nIn March 2018, an independent report commissioned by the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, proposed structural changes to local government in [[Northamptonshire]]. These changes would see the existing county council and district councils abolished and two new unitary authorities created in their place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-40610349|title=Troubled council 'should be scrapped'|date=15 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> One authority would consist of the existing districts of [[Daventry District|Daventry]], [[Northampton]] and [[South Northamptonshire]] and the other authority would consist of [[Corby (borough)|Corby]], [[East Northamptonshire]], [[Borough of Kettering|Kettering]] and [[Borough of Wellingborough|Wellingborough]] districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2018-03-15/northamptonshire-county-council-should-be-split-up-finds-damning-report/|title=Northamptonshire County Council 'should be split up', finds damning report|website=itv.com|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Functions==\nUnitary authorities combine the powers and functions that are normally delivered separately by the councils of non-metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan districts. These functions are housing, waste management, waste collection, council tax collection, education, libraries, social services, transport, planning, consumer protection, licensing, cemeteries and crematoria. The breakdown of these services is as follows:<ref>Frequently Asked Questions on the structural reviews of Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk, Boundary Commission for England</ref>\n\n{{Non-metropolitan local authority functions}}\n\n==Electoral arrangements==\nMost unitary authorities are divided into a number of multiple member [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] from which councillors are elected in the same way as in two-tier district council elections. The exceptions, which are divided into electoral divisions as in county council elections, are Cornwall, County Durham, the Isle of Wight, Northumberland, Shropshire and Wiltshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/help.html|title=Help using the election maps apps|website=openspace.ordnancesurvey.co.uk|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Current list==\nMost unitary authorities are legally defined as being coterminous non-metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan districts run by a single council. While it makes no difference, they can either be run by a county council that additionally has district powers and functions, or a district council that additionally has county powers and functions. If there's a county council, the district has no council, and vice versa. Districts can additionally have the status of [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] or [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], although this has no effect on their powers or functions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
