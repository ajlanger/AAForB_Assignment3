The ships were the largest and most powerful warships built for the ''Kriegsmarine''; displacing more than {{convert|41000|MT|LT}} normally, they were armed with a battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}} guns and were capable of a top speed of {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}. {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} was laid down in July 1936 and completed in September 1940, while her sister {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}{{'}}s keel was laid in October 1936 and work finished in February 1941. The ships were ordered in response to the French {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s and they were designed with the traditional role of engaging enemy battleships in home waters in mind, though the German naval command envisioned employing the ships as long-range commerce raiders against British shipping in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. As such, their design represented strategic confusion that dominated German naval construction in the 1930s.\n\nBoth ships had short service careers. ''Bismarck'' conducted only one operation, [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung]], a sortie into the North Atlantic to raid supply [[convoy]]s sent from North America to Great Britain. During the operation, she destroyed the British [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} and damaged the new battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} in the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]]. ''Bismarck'' was defeated and sunk in a [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|final engagement]] after a three-day chase by the [[Royal Navy]]. Disagreements over the cause of the sinking persist with chiefly British sources claiming responsibility for the sinking of the ship. Evidence reviewed by [[Robert Ballard]] and [[James Cameron]] indicates that her loss was most likely due to [[scuttling]] as originally claimed by her surviving crew-members.\n\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s career was less dramatic; she operated in the [[Baltic Sea]] briefly in 1941 before being sent to Norwegian waters in 1942, where she acted as a [[fleet in being]], threatening the convoys from Britain to the Soviet Union. She was [[List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz|repeatedly attacked]] by the Royal Navy and [[Royal Air Force]] between 1942 and 1944, but she was not seriously damaged in these attacks. In 1944, [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] hit the ship with two [[Tallboy bomb]]s, which caused extensive internal damage and [[capsize]]d the battleship. ''Tirpitz'' was broken up for scrap between 1948 and 1957.\n\n== Design ==\nA series of conceptual designs was begun by the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (Navy of the Realm) in 1932 to determine the ideal characteristics of a battleship built to the {{convert|35000|LT|abbr=on}} limit of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. These early studies determined that the ship should be armed with eight {{convert|33|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns, have a top speed of {{convert|30|kn}}, and have strong armor protection.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}} At the time, the German Navy was constrained by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that had ended [[World War I]], which restricted battleships to a maximum displacement of {{convert|10000|LT}}. The design work for what became the ''Bismarck'' class was begun in 1933 and continued until 1936.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} During this period, the naval leadership grappled with a variety of problems, including the strategic and operational use of such a ship and the preferred propulsion system. War games suggested that the new battleships could be used both to attack French shipping at long range and to fight in a traditional battle against the French and Polish navies, then seen as the most likely threats.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1021\u20131023}} Due to the numerical inferiority of the German fleet and the assumption that naval battles would take place at relatively close range in the [[North Sea]], the design staff placed great emphasis on stability and armor protection. Very thick vertical [[belt armor]] was adopted, along with heavy upper-citadel armor plating and extensive splinter protection in the bow and stern of the ships.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu-2.jpg|thumb|left|The French battleship {{ship|French battleship|Richelieu||2}} in Dakar in 1940; the ''Bismarck''-class battleships were ordered to counter ''Richelieu'']]\n\nThe ''Reichsmarine'' learned in June 1934 that Italy had decided to build a pair of 35,000-ton battleships armed with {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} guns, which would surely provoke the construction of similar ships for the French fleet. To keep pace with their French rivals, the next two battleships built by Germany would need to be of a similar size and armament. At the same time, Germany was preparing to begin negotiations with Great Britain to secure a bilateral naval agreement that would effectively abrogate the naval restrictions of the Versailles treaty. In exchange, Germany would limit its fleet to a third the size of the [[Royal Navy]]. With the construction of at least two 35,000-ton battleships within reach, the German naval design staff began work in late October to lay out requirements for armament, armor, and speed. A preliminary design was completed in November, which resulted in a ship armed with eight 33&nbsp;cm guns in four twin [[gun turret]]s, protected an [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on}} thick, and capable of a top speed of {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}. The staff noted that such a ship would likely exceed the 35,000-ton limit, so triple or quadruple turrets should be considered to reduce the weight.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1023\u20131026}}\n\nThe design staff had decided that four twin turrets would provide the best solution to distribution of the main battery, as it would provide equal firepower forward and aft, as well as simplify fire control. This arrangement was similar to the last German battleships of the [[German Empire|Imperial period]], the {{sclass-|Bayern|battleship|4}}. The similarity led to speculation that the ''Bismarck''s were essentially copies of the earlier ships, though the arrangement of the main battery was the only shared trait, along with a three-shaft propulsion system.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=204}} As design work continued into January 1935, ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' (General Admiral) [[Erich Raeder]], the commander of the ''Reichsmarine'', met with the various department and section leaders to refine the design requirements. The Naval Ordnance Department argued for an increase to 35&nbsp;cm guns to keep parity with the expected Italian and French ships, which Raeder approved on 19 January. Another meeting in March saw the Ordnance Department raise the possibility of increasing the projected main battery again to {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}}, though Raeder initially rejected the idea owing to the significant increase in displacement. Nevertheless, though he formally approved the 35&nbsp;cm version on 1 April, he allowed for the option to increase the main battery depending on foreign developments. Just a month later, Raeder decided to adopt the larger gun on 9 May, largely the result of Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]]'s preference for the 38&nbsp;cm gun.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1026\u20131028}}\n\nIn June 1935, Germany signed the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]], which allowed Germany to build battleships at a ratio of 35&nbsp;percent to the total tonnage of the Royal Navy;{{sfn|Maiolo|pp=35\u201336}} this granted Germany effective parity with France, at least in terms of allotted tonnage.{{sfn|Mulligan|p=1028}} It also made Germany party to the international treaty system begun at the [[Washington Naval Conference|Washington Conference]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}} By this time, the only significant issue to be settled was the propulsion system, which was largely dependent on strategic questions. Many senior officers in the navy envisioned using the ''Bismarck'' class in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], which would require a long cruising range.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1028\u20131031}} The naval constructors examined [[diesel engine]]s, [[steam turbine]]s, and turbo-electric drive engines; the last system was the preferred choice, as it had been extremely successful in the two American {{sclass-|Lexington|aircraft carrier|2}}s and the French passenger ship {{SS|Normandie||2}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=204}} The design staff were also required to provide sufficient range to the new battleships; they would have to make long voyages from German ports to reach the Atlantic, and Germany had no overseas bases where the ships could refuel.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=205\u2013206}} Raeder ordered the turbo-electric engines for the new ships, but the contracting manufacturer, [[Siemens-Schuckert]], could not meet the navy's requirements and removed itself from the project less than a month before construction on ''Bismarck'' began, forcing the navy to revert to high-pressure steam turbines.{{sfn|Mulligan|p=1031}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\nThe displacement of ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' was ultimately limited by the capabilities of existing infrastructure in [[Kiel]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]], and the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]], rather than international agreements. On 11 February 1937, the Construction Office informed Raeder that the ships could not displace more than {{convert|42000|LT|abbr=on}} due to harbor constraints and canal depths. The office also expressed a preference for building a third vessel and remaining within the 35,000-ton treaty limit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=206}} Admiral Werner Fuchs, the head of the General Command Office of the [[Oberkommando der Marine]], advised Raeder and Hitler that modifications would be necessary to reduce the displacement to ensure the new ships met the legal requirements of the [[London Naval Treaty]]. Japan refused to sign the new treaty, and so on 1 April 1937 an [[escalator clause]] permitting treaty signatories to build ships up to a limit of {{convert|45000|LT|abbr=on}} went into effect. The final design displacement of {{convert|41400|LT|abbr=on}} was well within this limit, so Fuchs's modifications were discarded.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=208}}\n\nDespite the fact that Raeder and other senior naval officers envisioned using ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' as commerce raiders against first French and later British shipping in the Atlantic, and in fact used them in that role during [[World War II]], the ships were not designed for that mission. Their steam turbines did not afford the necessary cruising radius for such a role, and many of the decisions made for the ships' armament and armor layout reflect the expectation to fight a traditional naval battle at relatively close range in the North Sea. The disconnect between how ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were designed and how they were ultimately used represents the strategic incoherence that dominated German naval construction in the 1930s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=204\u2013205}}{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1042\u20131043}}\n\n=== General characteristics ===\nThe ''Bismarck''-class battleships were {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long [[Length overall|overall]] and {{convert|241.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long [[Length at the waterline|at the waterline]]. The ships had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a designed [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.30|m|ftin|abbr=on}}; the draft at standard [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|8.63|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|9.90|m|ftin|abbr=on}} at a full load. The ships had a designed displacement of {{convert|45950|MT|LT|lk=on}}; ''Bismarck''{{'}}s standard displacement was {{convert|41700|MT|LT|sp=us|abbr=on}}, and when fully laden, the ship displaced {{convert|50300|MT|LT|sp=us|abbr=on}}. ''Tirpitz'' was heavier, displacing {{convert|42900|MT|LT|abbr=on}} and {{convert|52600|MT|LT|abbr=on|sp=us}}, respectively. The ships had a [[double bottom]] for 83&nbsp;percent of the length of the hull, and twenty-two [[watertight compartment]]s. The ships were 90&nbsp;percent welded construction.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The stern was weakly constructed; this had significant consequences on ''Bismarck''{{'}}s only combat mission.{{sfn|Preston|p=151}}\n\nThe ships were very stable, primarily because of their wide beam. The ships suffered from only slight pitching and rolling, even in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were responsive to commands from the helm; they were capable of maneuvering with [[rudder]] deflections as small as 5\u00b0. With the rudder completely over, the ships heeled only 3\u00b0, but lost up to 65% of their speed. The ships handled poorly at low speeds or when traveling astern. As a result, tugs were necessary in confined areas to avoid collisions or grounding. The ships had a standard crew of 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted sailors. The ships carried smaller boats, including three picket boats, four barges, one [[Launch (boat)|launch]], two [[pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnaces]], two [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], two [[yawl]]s, and two [[Dinghy|dinghies]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}\n\n=== Propulsion ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-30-5-31A, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|''Bismarck'' in drydock, showing the three-shaft arrangement]]\n\nThe ''Bismarck''-class ships both had three sets of geared turbine engines; ''Bismarck'' was equipped with [[Blohm & Voss]] turbines, while ''Tirpitz'' used [[Brown, Boveri & Cie|Brown, Boveri, and Co.]] engines. Each set of turbines drove a 3-bladed [[propeller|screw]] that was {{convert|4.70|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter. The three-shaft arrangement was chosen over a four-shaft system, as was typically used on foreign capital ships, since it would save weight. At a full load, the high and medium-pressure turbines ran at 2,825&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], while the low-pressure turbines ran at 2,390&nbsp;rpm. The ships' turbines were powered by twelve Wagner ultra high-pressure, oil-burning [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were originally intended to use electric-transmission turbines that would have produced {{convert|46000|shp|abbr=on}} apiece. These engines would have provided for a higher top speed, but at the cost of greater weight. The geared turbines were significantly lighter, and as a result had a slight performance advantage. The geared turbines also had a significantly more robust construction, and so they were adopted instead.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33\u201335}}{{sfn|Mulligan|p=1026}}\n\nBoth ships were rated for a top speed of {{convert|30|kn}}; ''Bismarck'' just exceeded this speed on [[sea trials]], reaching {{convert|30.01|kn}}, while ''Tirpitz'' made {{convert|30.8|kn}} on trials. This difference was largely the result of a significant increase in horsepower for ''Tirpitz'', which reached {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}}, compared to {{convert|150170|PS|shp|0|disp=number}} for ''Bismarck''. The two ships had different fuel stores; ''Bismarck'' was designed to carry 3,200&nbsp;tons of fuel oil, but could store up to 6,400&nbsp;tons of fuel in a normal configuration; with extra fuel bunkers, the fuel carried could be increased up to 7,400&nbsp;tons. ''Tirpitz'' was designed to carry 3,000&nbsp;tons of fuel, and with additional bunkers, was able to store up to 7,780&nbsp;tons. At 19&nbsp;knots, ''Bismarck'' could steam for {{convert|8525|nmi|km}}, and ''Tirpitz'' had a maximum range of {{convert|8870|nmi|km}} at that speed.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}}\n\nRobert Ballard, the discoverer of ''Bismarck'', noted that the adoption of the three-shaft arrangement caused serious problems for ''Bismarck''. The center shaft weakened the keel, especially where it emerged from the hull. In addition to retaining greater hull strength, a four-shaft arrangement would have allowed a greater ability to steer the ship using only propeller revolutions than the three-screw system according to Ballard.{{sfn|Ballard|p=232}} During ''Bismarck''{{'}}s Atlantic operation in May 1941, the ship's rudder was disabled by a torpedo hit, and her course could not be corrected by altering screw revolutions;{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=234\u2013237}} this problem had already been revealed during sea trials, but it could not be corrected.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=39}}\n\nElectric power was provided by a variety of generators, including eight 500&nbsp;kW diesel generators arranged in four pairs, five 690&nbsp;kW turbo-generators, and one 460&nbsp;kW generator, the last of which was connected to a 400&nbsp;k[[Volt-ampere|VA]] [[alternating current|AC]] generator. Another 550&nbsp;kVA diesel generator provided additional AC power. The electrical plant provided a total 7,910&nbsp;kW at 220&nbsp;volts.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-05-2-07A, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward main battery [[gun turret|turret]]]]\n\n==== Main battery ====\n''Bismarck''{{'}}s and ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main battery consisted of eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|{{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK C/34]] guns in four twin turrets, ''Anton'' and ''Bruno'' in a superfiring pair forward of the [[superstructure]] and ''Caesar'' and ''Dora'' aft.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=34\u201335}} The turrets allowed elevation to 30\u00b0, which gave the guns a maximum range of {{convert|36520|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The guns fired {{convert|800|kg|lb|abbr=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 820&nbsp;meters per second (2,690&nbsp;ft/s).{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=275}} The main battery was supplied with between 940\u2013960 shells total, for approximately 115\u2013120 shells per gun.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} As with other German large-caliber naval rifles, these guns were designed by [[Krupp]] and featured sliding wedge breech blocks, which required brass cartridge cases for the propellant charges. Under optimal conditions, the rate of fire was one shot every 18 seconds, or three per minute.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=274}} The gun turrets were electrically trained and the guns were hydraulically elevated. Gun elevation was controlled remotely. The turrets required each gun to return to 2.5\u00b0 elevation for loading.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=278}} ''Tirpitz'' was eventually provided with time-fuzed shells to combat the repeated Allied bombing attacks.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=279}}\n\nThe ''Bismarck''s' use of four twin turrets (the 4 \u00d7 2 configuration) was a design practice that hearkened back to the First World War. Almost all other post-1921 capital ships had triple or even quadruple turrets, which allowed for additional heavy caliber guns, while reducing the number of turrets. Fewer turrets reduced the length of the battleship's armored citadel (particularly magazine length and the armor needed to protect it) and shortened the vessel itself. Although triple turrets were considered for the ''Bismarck''s, there were concerns that the extra barrel would lower the overall rate of fire in each turret, along with fears that a single well-aimed hit could disable a larger proportion of the ship's firepower. It was also felt that four twin turrets allowed for a better field of fire and a more effective sequence of salvos.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=33}}\n\n==== Secondary battery ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-06-7-16, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|One of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets]]\nThe ships' secondary battery consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|{{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK C/28]] guns mounted in six twin turrets.{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} The 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets were based on the single-gun turrets used aboard the ''Scharnhorst'' class. They could elevate to 40\u00b0 and depress to \u221210\u00b0; they had a rate of fire of around six shots per minute.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=279}} The 15&nbsp;cm guns fired a {{convert|45.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of 875&nbsp;m/s (2,871&nbsp;ft/s). At maximum elevation, the guns could hit targets out to {{convert|23000|m|yd|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=275}} As with the main battery guns, ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 15&nbsp;cm guns were later supplied with time-fused shells.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=279}}\n\nThe decision to mount low-angle 15&nbsp;cm guns has been criticized by naval historians, including [[Antony Preston]], who stated that they \"imposed a severe weight penalty\", while American and British battleships were being armed with dual-purpose guns.{{sfn|Preston|p=152}} Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin note that \"the use of dual-purpose armament would have possibly increased the number of anti-aircraft guns, but might have weakened the defence against destroyer attack, which German naval experts deemed more important.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=297}}\n\n==== Anti-aircraft battery ====\nAs built, ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were equipped with an anti-aircraft battery of sixteen [[10.5 cm FlaK 38|{{convert|10.5|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] C/33 65-caliber guns in eight twin mounts, sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] C/30 guns in eight dual mounts, and twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] C/30 guns in individual mounts.{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} The 10.5&nbsp;cm guns were the same weapons as used aboard the ''Scharnhorst'' class, and were mounted on the first superstructure deck. After ''Bismarck'' was sunk in 1941, two amidships guns on ''Tirpitz'' were moved forward so as to provide them with better fields of fire. The sixteen guns were guided by four fire-control directors, two just aft of the [[conning tower]], a third positioned aft of the main mast, and the fourth directly behind turret Caesar. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s directors were covered by protective domes, though ''Bismarck''{{'}}s were not.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=280}}\n\nThe ships' 37&nbsp;mm 83-caliber guns were twin mounted and placed in the superstructure. The mounts were hand-operated and automatically stabilized for roll and pitch.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=282}} These guns were supplied with a total of 32,000&nbsp;rounds of ammunition. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were initially armed with twelve 20&nbsp;mm guns in single mounts, though these were augmented over time.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} ''Bismarck'' received a pair of quadruple gun mountings, for a total of twenty 20&nbsp;mm guns. Over the course of her career, ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 20&nbsp;mm battery was increased to 78 guns in single and quadruple mountings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=282}}\n\n=== Armor ===\nThe ''Bismarck''-class ships had an armored belt that ranged in thickness from {{convert|220|to|320|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the thickest section of armor covered the central portion, where the gun turrets, ammunition magazines, and machinery spaces were located. This portion of the belt was capped on either end by 220&nbsp;mm thick transverse bulkheads. The ships had an upper deck that was {{cvt|50|mm|0}} thick, and an armored deck that was between {{cvt|100|to|120|mm}} thick amidships, and tapered down to {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the bow and {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the stern.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The deck was mounted low in the hull, however, which reduced the volume of internal space protected by the armored citadel. This contrasted with contemporary British and American designs that featured a single thick armored deck mounted high in the ship.{{sfn|Preston|p=151}}\n\nThe forward conning tower had a {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick roof and {{convert|350|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick sides, while the range finder had an armored roof 100&nbsp;mm thick and 200&nbsp;mm thick sides. The aft conning tower had much lighter armor: the roof was 50&nbsp;mm thick and the sides were {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}}, while the aft range finder had a 50&nbsp;mm thick roof and 100&nbsp;mm sides. The main battery turrets were reasonably well-protected: the turret roofs were {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, the sides were 220&nbsp;mm thick, and the faces were {{convert|360|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick with {{convert|220|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick shields.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} These armor thicknesses were less than those of contemporary British ({{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|5}}) and French (''Richelieu'') designs. Conversely, the secondary battery was better-protected than most rivals.{{sfn|Breyer, ''Battleships and Battle Cruisers''|p=300}} The 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets had {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick roofs, {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} sides, and 100&nbsp;mm fronts.

The granddaughter of the ship's namesake, [[Otto von Bismarck]], christened the ship. As with other German capital ships, ''Bismarck'' was originally built with a straight bow. Experiences with other ships revealed the necessity of a [[clipper]] bow to prevent them from shipping too much water in heavy seas, so Blohm & Voss accordingly modified ''Bismarck''{{'}}s bow during the [[fitting-out]] process. The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 24 August 1940, with [[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]] [[Ernst Lindemann]] in command. Three weeks later, the ship left Hamburg for trials in the [[Baltic Sea]], before returning in December for final fitting-out work. Further trials and tests were conducted in the Baltic in March and April; ''Bismarck'' was placed on active status the following month.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s keel was laid at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven|''Kriegsmarinewerft'']] (Kriegsmarine Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven on 20 October 1936,{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} under construction number 128. She had been ordered under the contract name ''Ersatz Schleswig-Holstein'' to replace the obsolete battleship {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} ''Tirpitz'' was named for Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[High Seas Fleet]] before World War I. His daughter, Frau von Hassel, christened the ship on 1 April 1939. Fitting out work lasted until February 1941;{{sfn|Williamson|p=35}} ''Tirpitz'' was commissioned into the fleet on 25 February.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} A series of trials were then conducted, first in the North Sea and then in the Baltic.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=35\u201336}}\n\n== Ships ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! align = center|Ship\n! align = center|Builder\n! align = center|Namesake\n! align = center|Laid down\n! align = center|Launched\n! align = center|Commissioned\n! align = center|Fate\n|-\n|[[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']]\n|[[Blohm & Voss]],<br> [[Hamburg]]\n|[[Chancellor of Germany|''Reichskanzler'']] [[Otto von Bismarck|Otto, F\u00fcrst von Bismarck]]\n|1 July 1936\n|14 February 1939\n|24 August 1940\n|[[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|Sunk following surface action]], 27 May 1941\n|-\n|[[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']]\n|[[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven|Kriegsmarinewerft]],<br> [[Wilhelmshaven]]\n|[[Grand admiral|''Gro\u00dfadmiral'']] [[Alfred von Tirpitz]]\n|2 November 1936\n|1 April 1939\n|25 February 1941\n|[[Operation Catechism|Sunk in air attack]] at [[Troms\u00f8]], 12 November 1944\n|}\n\n== Service history ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-03-5-18, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|''Bismarck'' in September 1940]]\n\n=== ''Bismarck'' ===\n{{main|German battleship Bismarck}}\nAfter ''Bismarck'' joined the fleet, plans were drawn up for a sortie into the North Atlantic, which was codenamed [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'']] (Rhine Exercise). The operation initially called for a force composed of ''Bismarck'', ''Tirpitz'', and the two {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|2}}s. ''Tirpitz'' was not yet ready for service by May 1941, and {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} was being overhauled. The force was reduced to ''Bismarck'', {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}. ''Gneisenau'' was damaged by a British bombing raid on [[Brest, France|Brest]], so it was decided that only ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' would conduct the operation. Admiral [[G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens]] was placed in command of the pair of ships.{{sfn|Williamson|p=22}}\n\nEarly on the morning of 19 May, ''Bismarck'' left [[Gotenhafen]], bound for the North Atlantic.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=63}} While on the trip through the [[Danish straits|Danish Belt]], ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' encountered the Swedish cruiser {{HSwMS|Gotland|1933|6}} in [[Kattegat]]; the sighting was passed through the Swedish Navy to the British naval attach\u00e9 in Stockholm.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=65\u201367}} The British [[Royal Air Force]] conducted aerial reconnaissance of the Norwegian fjord in which ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had stopped, to confirm the sighting. While in Norway, Admiral L\u00fctjens failed to replenish the approximately {{convert|1000|LT|abbr=on}} of fuel ''Bismarck'' had spent on the first leg of the voyage.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=71}}\n\nBy 23 May, ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had reached the [[Denmark Strait]]. That evening, the British cruisers {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}} and {{HMS|Norfolk|78|2}} briefly engaged ''Bismarck'' before dropping back to shadow the German ships.{{sfn|Williamson|p=23}} At 06:00 the following morning, observers aboard ''Bismarck'' spotted the masts of the battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} and the new battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}}.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=23\u201324}} The British ships steamed directly towards ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'', before attempting a turn to bring the two forces on a roughly parallel course. During the turn, at least one of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm shells penetrated one of the aft ammunition magazines aboard ''Hood'', which caused a catastrophic explosion and destroyed the ship.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=147\u2013153}} There were only three survivors from ''Hood''{{'}}s crew of 1,421. The German ships then concentrated their fire on ''Prince of Wales'', which was forced to withdraw. ''Bismarck'' did not emerge unscathed; a direct hit on her bow from ''Prince of Wales'' caused ''Bismarck'' to take in some {{convert|2000|LT|abbr=on}} of water. The ship was also leaking oil, which made it easier for the British to track her.{{sfn|Williamson|p=24}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1984-055-14, Schlachtschiff Bismarck, nach Seegefecht.jpg|thumb|left|''Bismarck'' after the battle with ''Hood'' and ''Prince of Wales'']]\n\nAfter retreating, ''Prince of Wales'' joined ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk''; the ships briefly engaged ''Bismarck'' at around 18:00. Neither side scored a hit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=227}} By this time, 19 warships were involved in the chase.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=229}} This included six battleships and battlecruisers and two aircraft carriers, along with a number of cruisers and destroyers.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}} After the second engagement with ''Prince of Wales'', L\u00fctjens detached ''Prinz Eugen'' to continue the operation while ''Bismarck'' sailed for port.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=176\u2013177}} Shortly before midnight on 24 May, a group of [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bombers from [[825 Naval Air Squadron]] on {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} attacked ''Bismarck''. One torpedo struck the ship amidships, though without doing any serious damage. The shock from the explosion, coupled with ''Bismarck''{{'}}s maneuvering at high speed, damaged the temporary repairs that had stopped the flooding from the earlier battle damage. Her speed was reduced to {{convert|16|kn}} to slow the flooding while repair teams fixed the reopened wounds.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=229\u2013230}}\n\nEarly on 25 May, ''Bismarck'' doubled back past her pursuers in a wide circle. The maneuver successfully shook off the British ships, which turned west in an attempt to find the ship. Despite the maneuver, Admiral L\u00fctjens was unaware that he had evaded the British, and so sent a series of radio transmissions, which were intercepted by the British and used to gain a rough fix on his position.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}} Due to the damage his ship had sustained, L\u00fctjens decided to head for occupied France rather than continue his mission. On the morning of 26 May, a Coastal Command [[PBY Catalina]] flying boat spotted ''Bismarck'' {{convert|690|nmi|abbr=on}} to the north-west of Brest; she was steaming at a speed that would put her under the protective umbrella of German aircraft and [[U-boat]]s within 24&nbsp;hours. The only British forces close enough to slow her down were the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} and her escort, the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=233}} At approximately 20:30, a flight of fifteen ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s [[820 Naval Air Squadron]]s Swordfish torpedo bombers launched an attack on ''Bismarck''. Three torpedoes were believed to have struck the ship; the first two torpedoes failed to do serious damage to the ship, but the third hit jammed ''Bismarck''{{'}}s rudders hard to starboard. The damage could not be repaired, and the battleship began turning in a large circle, back towards her pursuers.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}}\n\nAn hour after the Swordfish attack, L\u00fctjens transmitted the following signal to Naval Group Command West: \"Ship unable to maneuver. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the F\u00fchrer.\"{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=266}} At 08:47 the following morning, the battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} opened fire, followed directly by {{HMS|King George V|41|2}}.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=288}} ''Bismarck'' replied three minutes later, though at 09:02 a 16-inch shell from ''Rodney'' destroyed the forward turrets.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=289\u2013290}} Half an hour later, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s rear turrets were silenced as well.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=291}} At around 10:15, both British battleships had ceased fire, their target a burning wreck. The British were running dangerously low on fuel, but ''Bismarck'' had not yet been sunk. The cruiser {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|2}} fired several torpedoes into the crippled ship, which then took on a severe list to port. At approximately the same time as ''Dorsetshire''{{'}}s attack, engine room crew detonated scuttling charges in the engine rooms.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=245\u2013246}} There is still significant debate as to the direct cause of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sinking. Only 110 men were rescued by the British before reports of U-boats forced them from the scene.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=34\u201335}} A further five men were rescued by German vessels.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=246}}\n\n=== ''Tirpitz'' ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J19316, Norwegen, Schlachtschiff, Zerst\u00f6rer.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' and several destroyers off the Norwegian coast]]\n{{main|German battleship Tirpitz}}\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s first action following her commissioning into the Kriegsmarine on 25 February 1941 was to act as a deterrent to a possible Soviet attempt to break out their [[Baltic Fleet]] following the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. The ship was joined by the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} and the light cruisers {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}. The force patrolled off the [[\u00c5land Islands]] for a few days before returning to Kiel.{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} On 14 January 1942, ''Tirpitz'' left German waters for Norway, arriving on the 17th.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} The Germans used the ship as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval forces to protect the convoy route to the Soviet Union and to deter an invasion of Norway.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}}\n\nOn 6 March, ''Tirpitz'', escorted by three destroyers, launched a raid on the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|British convoys to the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} The Germans attempted to intercept convoys PQ-12 and QP-8,{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} but the inclement weather prevented them from finding the convoys.{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} The British located ''Tirpitz'', and the aircraft carrier ''Victorious'' launched a strike of twelve [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers. The aircraft were repulsed without having scored any hits on the German ships. ''Tirpitz'' and the destroyers were back in port by 12 March.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} The close call prompted Hitler to mandate that ''Tirpitz'' was not to attack another convoy unless its escorting aircraft carrier had been sunk or disabled.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}}\n\nOver the next two months, the RAF launched a series of unsuccessful bombing raids against ''Tirpitz'' while she was moored in the [[Faettenfjord]]. The first, by 34 [[Handley Page Halifax]] bombers, took place on 31 March. Two followed a month later, on 28 and 29 April. The first attack was conducted by 43 Halifax and [[Avro Lancaster]] bombers, the second by 34 Halifax and Lancaster.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} A combination of heavy German anti-aircraft fire and poor weather caused all three missions to fail.{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} Over the rest of the year and into late 1942, ''Tirpitz'' underwent a refit in the Faettenfjord, which lacked dockyard facilities of any type. As a result, the work was done incrementally; a large [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built to allow the rudders to be replaced.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin stated that \"the repairs to this ship were one of the most difficult naval engineering feats of World War II.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=256}}\n\nIn January 1943, ''Tirpitz'' emerged from the lengthy overhaul, after which she was transferred to [[Altafjord]]. Here, she participated in extensive training operations with ''Scharnhorst'' and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, which lasted until the middle of the year.{{sfn|Williamson|p=37}} In early September, ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ten destroyers bombarded the island of [[Spitzbergen]], which served as a British refuelling station. The two battleships destroyed their targets and returned safely to Altenfjord; this was the first time ''Tirpitz'' fired her main guns in anger.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} On 22\u201323 September, six [[Operation Source|British midget submarines]] attacked ''Tirpitz'' while at anchor. Two of the submarines successfully planted explosive charges against the battleship's hull, which did serious damage. ''Tirpitz'' had been successfully neutralized.{{sfn|Williamson|p=37}} Over the next six months, a workforce of some 1,000 men effected the needed repairs, which were finished by March 1944.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n[[File:Fleet Air Arm attack the battleship Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' under attack by Barracuda bombers on 3 April]]\n\nThe British resumed the [[List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz|series of air attacks]] almost immediately after repairs were completed. On 3 April, the Royal Navy launched [[Operation Tungsten]], during which 40&nbsp;fighters and 40&nbsp;[[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]] bombers from six carriers attacked the ship. They scored 15 direct hits and two near misses, which caused heavy damage, killed 122 men, and wounded 316 more. The Royal Navy attempted to repeat the attack three weeks later on the 24th, but had to call the operation off due to inclement weather. Operation Brawn, another carrier-launched attack, followed on 15 May, but again weather interfered. Another carrier strike was attempted on 28 May, but it too was cancelled due to poor weather conditions. [[Operation Mascot]], which was to be conducted by the carriers ''Victorious'', ''Furious'', and {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} on 17 July, was frustrated by the heavy smokescreen over the battleship.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=26}}\n\nThe Royal Navy launched the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Operation Goodwood]] series in late August. Goodwood I took place on 22 August, with 38 bombers and 43 fighters from five carriers. The attackers failed to score any hits. Goodwood III followed two days later, with 48 bombers and 29 fighters from {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}}, ''Furious'', and ''Indefatigable''. The bombers made two hits on the ship, which did only minor damage. The last Royal Navy operation, Goodwood IV, followed on 29 August. Thirty-four bombers and 25 fighters, launched from ''Formidable'' and ''Indefatigable'', attacked the ship, though fog prevented them from scoring any hits.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=26}}\n\nThe task of sinking ''Tirpitz'' now fell to the RAF, which performed three airstrikes armed with new {{convert|5400|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Tallboy bomb]]s.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=26}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], came on 15 September, when a force of 27 Lancasters dropped a single Tallboy each; the bombers succeeded in hitting ''Tirpitz'' directly in the bow with one of the bombs. The bomb completely penetrated the ship and exploded directly under her keel. This caused {{convert|1500|MT|abbr=on}} of water to flood the ship; ''Tirpitz'' had again been disabled.{{sfn|Williamson|p=39}} A month later, on 15 October, ''Tirpitz'' was moved to H\u00e5k\u00f8ya Island off [[Troms\u00f8]] to be used as a floating artillery battery. Two weeks later, on 29 October, the British launched [[Operation Obviate]], which consisted of 32 Lancaster bombers. Only a near miss was achieved, though it caused ''Tirpitz'' to take in more water. The last attack, [[Operation Catechism]], took place on 12 November. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship and scored a pair of direct hits and a near miss.

The ships were the largest and most powerful warships built for the ''Kriegsmarine''; displacing more than {{convert|41000|MT|LT}} normally, they were armed with a battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}} guns and were capable of a top speed of {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}. {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} was laid down in July 1936 and completed in September 1940, while her sister {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}{{'}}s keel was laid in October 1936 and work finished in February 1941. The ships were ordered in response to the French {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s and they were designed with the traditional role of engaging enemy battleships in home waters in mind, though the German naval command envisioned employing the ships as long-range commerce raiders against British shipping in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. As such, their design represented strategic confusion that dominated German naval construction in the 1930s.\n\nBoth ships had short service careers. ''Bismarck'' conducted only one operation, [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung]], a sortie into the North Atlantic to raid supply [[convoy]]s sent from North America to Great Britain. During the operation, she destroyed the British [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} and damaged the new battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} in the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]]. ''Bismarck'' was defeated and sunk in a [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|final engagement]] after a three-day chase by the [[Royal Navy]]. Disagreements over the cause of the sinking persist with chiefly British sources claiming responsibility for the sinking of the ship. Evidence reviewed by [[Robert Ballard]] and [[James Cameron]] indicates that her loss was most likely due to [[scuttling]] as originally claimed by her surviving crew-members.\n\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s career was less dramatic; she operated in the [[Baltic Sea]] briefly in 1941 before being sent to Norwegian waters in 1942, where she acted as a [[fleet in being]], threatening the convoys from Britain to the Soviet Union. She was [[List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz|repeatedly attacked]] by the Royal Navy and [[Royal Air Force]] between 1942 and 1944, but she was not seriously damaged in these attacks. In 1944, [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] hit the ship with two [[Tallboy bomb]]s, which caused extensive internal damage and [[capsize]]d the battleship. ''Tirpitz'' was broken up for scrap between 1948 and 1957.\n\n== Design ==\nA series of conceptual designs was begun by the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (Navy of the Realm) in 1932 to determine the ideal characteristics of a battleship built to the {{convert|35000|LT|abbr=on}} limit of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. These early studies determined that the ship should be armed with eight {{convert|33|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns, have a top speed of {{convert|30|kn}}, and have strong armor protection.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}} At the time, the German Navy was constrained by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that had ended [[World War I]], which restricted battleships to a maximum displacement of {{convert|10000|LT}}. The design work for what became the ''Bismarck'' class was begun in 1933 and continued until 1936.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} During this period, the naval leadership grappled with a variety of problems, including the strategic and operational use of such a ship and the preferred propulsion system. War games suggested that the new battleships could be used both to attack French shipping at long range and to fight in a traditional battle against the French and Polish navies, then seen as the most likely threats.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1021\u20131023}} Due to the numerical inferiority of the German fleet and the assumption that naval battles would take place at relatively close range in the [[North Sea]], the design staff placed great emphasis on stability and armor protection. Very thick vertical [[belt armor]] was adopted, along with heavy upper-citadel armor plating and extensive splinter protection in the bow and stern of the ships.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu-2.jpg|thumb|left|The French battleship {{ship|French battleship|Richelieu||2}} in Dakar in 1940; the ''Bismarck''-class battleships were ordered to counter ''Richelieu'']]\n\nThe ''Reichsmarine'' learned in June 1934 that Italy had decided to build a pair of 35,000-ton battleships armed with {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} guns, which would surely provoke the construction of similar ships for the French fleet. To keep pace with their French rivals, the next two battleships built by Germany would need to be of a similar size and armament. At the same time, Germany was preparing to begin negotiations with Great Britain to secure a bilateral naval agreement that would effectively abrogate the naval restrictions of the Versailles treaty. In exchange, Germany would limit its fleet to a third the size of the [[Royal Navy]]. With the construction of at least two 35,000-ton battleships within reach, the German naval design staff began work in late October to lay out requirements for armament, armor, and speed. A preliminary design was completed in November, which resulted in a ship armed with eight 33&nbsp;cm guns in four twin [[gun turret]]s, protected an [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on}} thick, and capable of a top speed of {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}. The staff noted that such a ship would likely exceed the 35,000-ton limit, so triple or quadruple turrets should be considered to reduce the weight.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1023\u20131026}}\n\nThe design staff had decided that four twin turrets would provide the best solution to distribution of the main battery, as it would provide equal firepower forward and aft, as well as simplify fire control. This arrangement was similar to the last German battleships of the [[German Empire|Imperial period]], the {{sclass-|Bayern|battleship|4}}. The similarity led to speculation that the ''Bismarck''s were essentially copies of the earlier ships, though the arrangement of the main battery was the only shared trait, along with a three-shaft propulsion system.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=204}} As design work continued into January 1935, ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' (General Admiral) [[Erich Raeder]], the commander of the ''Reichsmarine'', met with the various department and section leaders to refine the design requirements. The Naval Ordnance Department argued for an increase to 35&nbsp;cm guns to keep parity with the expected Italian and French ships, which Raeder approved on 19 January. Another meeting in March saw the Ordnance Department raise the possibility of increasing the projected main battery again to {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}}, though Raeder initially rejected the idea owing to the significant increase in displacement. Nevertheless, though he formally approved the 35&nbsp;cm version on 1 April, he allowed for the option to increase the main battery depending on foreign developments. Just a month later, Raeder decided to adopt the larger gun on 9 May, largely the result of Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]]'s preference for the 38&nbsp;cm gun.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1026\u20131028}}\n\nIn June 1935, Germany signed the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]], which allowed Germany to build battleships at a ratio of 35&nbsp;percent to the total tonnage of the Royal Navy;{{sfn|Maiolo|pp=35\u201336}} this granted Germany effective parity with France, at least in terms of allotted tonnage.{{sfn|Mulligan|p=1028}} It also made Germany party to the international treaty system begun at the [[Washington Naval Conference|Washington Conference]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}} By this time, the only significant issue to be settled was the propulsion system, which was largely dependent on strategic questions. Many senior officers in the navy envisioned using the ''Bismarck'' class in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], which would require a long cruising range.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1028\u20131031}} The naval constructors examined [[diesel engine]]s, [[steam turbine]]s, and turbo-electric drive engines; the last system was the preferred choice, as it had been extremely successful in the two American {{sclass-|Lexington|aircraft carrier|2}}s and the French passenger ship {{SS|Normandie||2}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=204}} The design staff were also required to provide sufficient range to the new battleships; they would have to make long voyages from German ports to reach the Atlantic, and Germany had no overseas bases where the ships could refuel.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=205\u2013206}} Raeder ordered the turbo-electric engines for the new ships, but the contracting manufacturer, [[Siemens-Schuckert]], could not meet the navy's requirements and removed itself from the project less than a month before construction on ''Bismarck'' began, forcing the navy to revert to high-pressure steam turbines.{{sfn|Mulligan|p=1031}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\nThe displacement of ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' was ultimately limited by the capabilities of existing infrastructure in [[Kiel]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]], and the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]], rather than international agreements. On 11 February 1937, the Construction Office informed Raeder that the ships could not displace more than {{convert|42000|LT|abbr=on}} due to harbor constraints and canal depths. The office also expressed a preference for building a third vessel and remaining within the 35,000-ton treaty limit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=206}} Admiral Werner Fuchs, the head of the General Command Office of the [[Oberkommando der Marine]], advised Raeder and Hitler that modifications would be necessary to reduce the displacement to ensure the new ships met the legal requirements of the [[London Naval Treaty]]. Japan refused to sign the new treaty, and so on 1 April 1937 an [[escalator clause]] permitting treaty signatories to build ships up to a limit of {{convert|45000|LT|abbr=on}} went into effect. The final design displacement of {{convert|41400|LT|abbr=on}} was well within this limit, so Fuchs's modifications were discarded.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=208}}\n\nDespite the fact that Raeder and other senior naval officers envisioned using ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' as commerce raiders against first French and later British shipping in the Atlantic, and in fact used them in that role during [[World War II]], the ships were not designed for that mission. Their steam turbines did not afford the necessary cruising radius for such a role, and many of the decisions made for the ships' armament and armor layout reflect the expectation to fight a traditional naval battle at relatively close range in the North Sea. The disconnect between how ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were designed and how they were ultimately used represents the strategic incoherence that dominated German naval construction in the 1930s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=204\u2013205}}{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1042\u20131043}}\n\n=== General characteristics ===\nThe ''Bismarck''-class battleships were {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long [[Length overall|overall]] and {{convert|241.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long [[Length at the waterline|at the waterline]]. The ships had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a designed [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.30|m|ftin|abbr=on}}; the draft at standard [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|8.63|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|9.90|m|ftin|abbr=on}} at a full load. The ships had a designed displacement of {{convert|45950|MT|LT|lk=on}}; ''Bismarck''{{'}}s standard displacement was {{convert|41700|MT|LT|sp=us|abbr=on}}, and when fully laden, the ship displaced {{convert|50300|MT|LT|sp=us|abbr=on}}. ''Tirpitz'' was heavier, displacing {{convert|42900|MT|LT|abbr=on}} and {{convert|52600|MT|LT|abbr=on|sp=us}}, respectively. The ships had a [[double bottom]] for 83&nbsp;percent of the length of the hull, and twenty-two [[watertight compartment]]s. The ships were 90&nbsp;percent welded construction.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The stern was weakly constructed; this had significant consequences on ''Bismarck''{{'}}s only combat mission.{{sfn|Preston|p=151}}\n\nThe ships were very stable, primarily because of their wide beam. The ships suffered from only slight pitching and rolling, even in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were responsive to commands from the helm; they were capable of maneuvering with [[rudder]] deflections as small as 5\u00b0. With the rudder completely over, the ships heeled only 3\u00b0, but lost up to 65% of their speed. The ships handled poorly at low speeds or when traveling astern. As a result, tugs were necessary in confined areas to avoid collisions or grounding. The ships had a standard crew of 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted sailors. The ships carried smaller boats, including three picket boats, four barges, one [[Launch (boat)|launch]], two [[pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnaces]], two [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], two [[yawl]]s, and two [[Dinghy|dinghies]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}\n\n=== Propulsion ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-30-5-31A, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|''Bismarck'' in drydock, showing the three-shaft arrangement]]\n\nThe ''Bismarck''-class ships both had three sets of geared turbine engines; ''Bismarck'' was equipped with [[Blohm & Voss]] turbines, while ''Tirpitz'' used [[Brown, Boveri & Cie|Brown, Boveri, and Co.]] engines. Each set of turbines drove a 3-bladed [[propeller|screw]] that was {{convert|4.70|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter. The three-shaft arrangement was chosen over a four-shaft system, as was typically used on foreign capital ships, since it would save weight. At a full load, the high and medium-pressure turbines ran at 2,825&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], while the low-pressure turbines ran at 2,390&nbsp;rpm. The ships' turbines were powered by twelve Wagner ultra high-pressure, oil-burning [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were originally intended to use electric-transmission turbines that would have produced {{convert|46000|shp|abbr=on}} apiece. These engines would have provided for a higher top speed, but at the cost of greater weight. The geared turbines were significantly lighter, and as a result had a slight performance advantage. The geared turbines also had a significantly more robust construction, and so they were adopted instead.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33\u201335}}{{sfn|Mulligan|p=1026}}\n\nBoth ships were rated for a top speed of {{convert|30|kn}}; ''Bismarck'' just exceeded this speed on [[sea trials]], reaching {{convert|30.01|kn}}, while ''Tirpitz'' made {{convert|30.8|kn}} on trials. This difference was largely the result of a significant increase in horsepower for ''Tirpitz'', which reached {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}}, compared to {{convert|150170|PS|shp|0|disp=number}} for ''Bismarck''. The two ships had different fuel stores; ''Bismarck'' was designed to carry 3,200&nbsp;tons of fuel oil, but could store up to 6,400&nbsp;tons of fuel in a normal configuration; with extra fuel bunkers, the fuel carried could be increased up to 7,400&nbsp;tons. ''Tirpitz'' was designed to carry 3,000&nbsp;tons of fuel, and with additional bunkers, was able to store up to 7,780&nbsp;tons. At 19&nbsp;knots, ''Bismarck'' could steam for {{convert|8525|nmi|km}}, and ''Tirpitz'' had a maximum range of {{convert|8870|nmi|km}} at that speed.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}}\n\nRobert Ballard, the discoverer of ''Bismarck'', noted that the adoption of the three-shaft arrangement caused serious problems for ''Bismarck''. The center shaft weakened the keel, especially where it emerged from the hull. In addition to retaining greater hull strength, a four-shaft arrangement would have allowed a greater ability to steer the ship using only propeller revolutions than the three-screw system according to Ballard.{{sfn|Ballard|p=232}} During ''Bismarck''{{'}}s Atlantic operation in May 1941, the ship's rudder was disabled by a torpedo hit, and her course could not be corrected by altering screw revolutions;{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=234\u2013237}} this problem had already been revealed during sea trials, but it could not be corrected.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=39}}\n\nElectric power was provided by a variety of generators, including eight 500&nbsp;kW diesel generators arranged in four pairs, five 690&nbsp;kW turbo-generators, and one 460&nbsp;kW generator, the last of which was connected to a 400&nbsp;k[[Volt-ampere|VA]] [[alternating current|AC]] generator. Another 550&nbsp;kVA diesel generator provided additional AC power. The electrical plant provided a total 7,910&nbsp;kW at 220&nbsp;volts.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-05-2-07A, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward main battery [[gun turret|turret]]]]\n\n==== Main battery ====\n''Bismarck''{{'}}s and ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main battery consisted of eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|{{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK C/34]] guns in four twin turrets, ''Anton'' and ''Bruno'' in a superfiring pair forward of the [[superstructure]] and ''Caesar'' and ''Dora'' aft.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=34\u201335}} The turrets allowed elevation to 30\u00b0, which gave the guns a maximum range of {{convert|36520|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The guns fired {{convert|800|kg|lb|abbr=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 820&nbsp;meters per second (2,690&nbsp;ft/s).{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=275}} The main battery was supplied with between 940\u2013960 shells total, for approximately 115\u2013120 shells per gun.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} As with other German large-caliber naval rifles, these guns were designed by [[Krupp]] and featured sliding wedge breech blocks, which required brass cartridge cases for the propellant charges. Under optimal conditions, the rate of fire was one shot every 18 seconds, or three per minute.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=274}} The gun turrets were electrically trained and the guns were hydraulically elevated. Gun elevation was controlled remotely. The turrets required each gun to return to 2.5\u00b0 elevation for loading.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=278}} ''Tirpitz'' was eventually provided with time-fuzed shells to combat the repeated Allied bombing attacks.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=279}}\n\nThe ''Bismarck''s' use of four twin turrets (the 4 \u00d7 2 configuration) was a design practice that hearkened back to the First World War. Almost all other post-1921 capital ships had triple or even quadruple turrets, which allowed for additional heavy caliber guns, while reducing the number of turrets. Fewer turrets reduced the length of the battleship's armored citadel (particularly magazine length and the armor needed to protect it) and shortened the vessel itself. Although triple turrets were considered for the ''Bismarck''s, there were concerns that the extra barrel would lower the overall rate of fire in each turret, along with fears that a single well-aimed hit could disable a larger proportion of the ship's firepower. It was also felt that four twin turrets allowed for a better field of fire and a more effective sequence of salvos.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=33}}\n\n==== Secondary battery ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-06-7-16, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|One of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets]]\nThe ships' secondary battery consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|{{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK C/28]] guns mounted in six twin turrets.{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} The 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets were based on the single-gun turrets used aboard the ''Scharnhorst'' class. They could elevate to 40\u00b0 and depress to \u221210\u00b0; they had a rate of fire of around six shots per minute.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=279}} The 15&nbsp;cm guns fired a {{convert|45.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of 875&nbsp;m/s (2,871&nbsp;ft/s). At maximum elevation, the guns could hit targets out to {{convert|23000|m|yd|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=275}} As with the main battery guns, ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 15&nbsp;cm guns were later supplied with time-fused shells.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=279}}\n\nThe decision to mount low-angle 15&nbsp;cm guns has been criticized by naval historians, including [[Antony Preston]], who stated that they \"imposed a severe weight penalty\", while American and British battleships were being armed with dual-purpose guns.{{sfn|Preston|p=152}} Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin note that \"the use of dual-purpose armament would have possibly increased the number of anti-aircraft guns, but might have weakened the defence against destroyer attack, which German naval experts deemed more important.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=297}}\n\n==== Anti-aircraft battery ====\nAs built, ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were equipped with an anti-aircraft battery of sixteen [[10.5 cm FlaK 38|{{convert|10.5|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] C/33 65-caliber guns in eight twin mounts, sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] C/30 guns in eight dual mounts, and twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] C/30 guns in individual mounts.{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} The 10.5&nbsp;cm guns were the same weapons as used aboard the ''Scharnhorst'' class, and were mounted on the first superstructure deck. After ''Bismarck'' was sunk in 1941, two amidships guns on ''Tirpitz'' were moved forward so as to provide them with better fields of fire. The sixteen guns were guided by four fire-control directors, two just aft of the [[conning tower]], a third positioned aft of the main mast, and the fourth directly behind turret Caesar. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s directors were covered by protective domes, though ''Bismarck''{{'}}s were not.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=280}}\n\nThe ships' 37&nbsp;mm 83-caliber guns were twin mounted and placed in the superstructure. The mounts were hand-operated and automatically stabilized for roll and pitch.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=282}} These guns were supplied with a total of 32,000&nbsp;rounds of ammunition. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were initially armed with twelve 20&nbsp;mm guns in single mounts, though these were augmented over time.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} ''Bismarck'' received a pair of quadruple gun mountings, for a total of twenty 20&nbsp;mm guns. Over the course of her career, ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 20&nbsp;mm battery was increased to 78 guns in single and quadruple mountings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=282}}\n\n=== Armor ===\nThe ''Bismarck''-class ships had an armored belt that ranged in thickness from {{convert|220|to|320|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the thickest section of armor covered the central portion, where the gun turrets, ammunition magazines, and machinery spaces were located. This portion of the belt was capped on either end by 220&nbsp;mm thick transverse bulkheads. The ships had an upper deck that was {{cvt|50|mm|0}} thick, and an armored deck that was between {{cvt|100|to|120|mm}} thick amidships, and tapered down to {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the bow and {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the stern.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The deck was mounted low in the hull, however, which reduced the volume of internal space protected by the armored citadel. This contrasted with contemporary British and American designs that featured a single thick armored deck mounted high in the ship.{{sfn|Preston|p=151}}\n\nThe forward conning tower had a {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick roof and {{convert|350|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick sides, while the range finder had an armored roof 100&nbsp;mm thick and 200&nbsp;mm thick sides. The aft conning tower had much lighter armor: the roof was 50&nbsp;mm thick and the sides were {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}}, while the aft range finder had a 50&nbsp;mm thick roof and 100&nbsp;mm sides. The main battery turrets were reasonably well-protected: the turret roofs were {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, the sides were 220&nbsp;mm thick, and the faces were {{convert|360|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick with {{convert|220|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick shields.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} These armor thicknesses were less than those of contemporary British ({{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|5}}) and French (''Richelieu'') designs. Conversely, the secondary battery was better-protected than most rivals.{{sfn|Breyer, ''Battleships and Battle Cruisers''|p=300}} The 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets had {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick roofs, {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} sides, and 100&nbsp;mm fronts.

The granddaughter of the ship's namesake, [[Otto von Bismarck]], christened the ship. As with other German capital ships, ''Bismarck'' was originally built with a straight bow. Experiences with other ships revealed the necessity of a [[clipper]] bow to prevent them from shipping too much water in heavy seas, so Blohm & Voss accordingly modified ''Bismarck''{{'}}s bow during the [[fitting-out]] process. The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 24 August 1940, with [[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]] [[Ernst Lindemann]] in command. Three weeks later, the ship left Hamburg for trials in the [[Baltic Sea]], before returning in December for final fitting-out work. Further trials and tests were conducted in the Baltic in March and April; ''Bismarck'' was placed on active status the following month.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s keel was laid at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven|''Kriegsmarinewerft'']] (Kriegsmarine Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven on 20 October 1936,{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} under construction number 128. She had been ordered under the contract name ''Ersatz Schleswig-Holstein'' to replace the obsolete battleship {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} ''Tirpitz'' was named for Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[High Seas Fleet]] before World War I.

The operation initially called for a force composed of ''Bismarck'', ''Tirpitz'', and the two {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|2}}s. ''Tirpitz'' was not yet ready for service by May 1941, and {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} was being overhauled. The force was reduced to ''Bismarck'', {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}. ''Gneisenau'' was damaged by a British bombing raid on [[Brest, France|Brest]], so it was decided that only ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' would conduct the operation. Admiral [[G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens]] was placed in command of the pair of ships.{{sfn|Williamson|p=22}}\n\nEarly on the morning of 19 May, ''Bismarck'' left [[Gotenhafen]], bound for the North Atlantic.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=63}} While on the trip through the [[Danish straits|Danish Belt]], ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' encountered the Swedish cruiser {{HSwMS|Gotland|1933|6}} in [[Kattegat]]; the sighting was passed through the Swedish Navy to the British naval attach\u00e9 in Stockholm.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=65\u201367}} The British [[Royal Air Force]] conducted aerial reconnaissance of the Norwegian fjord in which ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had stopped, to confirm the sighting. While in Norway, Admiral L\u00fctjens failed to replenish the approximately {{convert|1000|LT|abbr=on}} of fuel ''Bismarck'' had spent on the first leg of the voyage.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=71}}\n\nBy 23 May, ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had reached the [[Denmark Strait]]. That evening, the British cruisers {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}} and {{HMS|Norfolk|78|2}} briefly engaged ''Bismarck'' before dropping back to shadow the German ships.{{sfn|Williamson|p=23}} At 06:00 the following morning, observers aboard ''Bismarck'' spotted the masts of the battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} and the new battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}}.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=23\u201324}} The British ships steamed directly towards ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'', before attempting a turn to bring the two forces on a roughly parallel course. During the turn, at least one of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm shells penetrated one of the aft ammunition magazines aboard ''Hood'', which caused a catastrophic explosion and destroyed the ship.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=147\u2013153}} There were only three survivors from ''Hood''{{'}}s crew of 1,421. The German ships then concentrated their fire on ''Prince of Wales'', which was forced to withdraw. ''Bismarck'' did not emerge unscathed; a direct hit on her bow from ''Prince of Wales'' caused ''Bismarck'' to take in some {{convert|2000|LT|abbr=on}} of water. The ship was also leaking oil, which made it easier for the British to track her.{{sfn|Williamson|p=24}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1984-055-14, Schlachtschiff Bismarck, nach Seegefecht.jpg|thumb|left|''Bismarck'' after the battle with ''Hood'' and ''Prince of Wales'']]\n\nAfter retreating, ''Prince of Wales'' joined ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk''; the ships briefly engaged ''Bismarck'' at around 18:00. Neither side scored a hit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=227}} By this time, 19 warships were involved in the chase.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=229}} This included six battleships and battlecruisers and two aircraft carriers, along with a number of cruisers and destroyers.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}} After the second engagement with ''Prince of Wales'', L\u00fctjens detached ''Prinz Eugen'' to continue the operation while ''Bismarck'' sailed for port.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=176\u2013177}} Shortly before midnight on 24 May, a group of [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bombers from [[825 Naval Air Squadron]] on {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} attacked ''Bismarck''. One torpedo struck the ship amidships, though without doing any serious damage. The shock from the explosion, coupled with ''Bismarck''{{'}}s maneuvering at high speed, damaged the temporary repairs that had stopped the flooding from the earlier battle damage. Her speed was reduced to {{convert|16|kn}} to slow the flooding while repair teams fixed the reopened wounds.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=229\u2013230}}\n\nEarly on 25 May, ''Bismarck'' doubled back past her pursuers in a wide circle. The maneuver successfully shook off the British ships, which turned west in an attempt to find the ship. Despite the maneuver, Admiral L\u00fctjens was unaware that he had evaded the British, and so sent a series of radio transmissions, which were intercepted by the British and used to gain a rough fix on his position.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}} Due to the damage his ship had sustained, L\u00fctjens decided to head for occupied France rather than continue his mission. On the morning of 26 May, a Coastal Command [[PBY Catalina]] flying boat spotted ''Bismarck'' {{convert|690|nmi|abbr=on}} to the north-west of Brest; she was steaming at a speed that would put her under the protective umbrella of German aircraft and [[U-boat]]s within 24&nbsp;hours. The only British forces close enough to slow her down were the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} and her escort, the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=233}} At approximately 20:30, a flight of fifteen ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s [[820 Naval Air Squadron]]s Swordfish torpedo bombers launched an attack on ''Bismarck''. Three torpedoes were believed to have struck the ship; the first two torpedoes failed to do serious damage to the ship, but the third hit jammed ''Bismarck''{{'}}s rudders hard to starboard. The damage could not be repaired, and the battleship began turning in a large circle, back towards her pursuers.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}}\n\nAn hour after the Swordfish attack, L\u00fctjens transmitted the following signal to Naval Group Command West: \"Ship unable to maneuver. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the F\u00fchrer.\"{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=266}} At 08:47 the following morning, the battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} opened fire, followed directly by {{HMS|King George V|41|2}}.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=288}} ''Bismarck'' replied three minutes later, though at 09:02 a 16-inch shell from ''Rodney'' destroyed the forward turrets.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=289\u2013290}} Half an hour later, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s rear turrets were silenced as well.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=291}} At around 10:15, both British battleships had ceased fire, their target a burning wreck. The British were running dangerously low on fuel, but ''Bismarck'' had not yet been sunk. The cruiser {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|2}} fired several torpedoes into the crippled ship, which then took on a severe list to port. At approximately the same time as ''Dorsetshire''{{'}}s attack, engine room crew detonated scuttling charges in the engine rooms.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=245\u2013246}} There is still significant debate as to the direct cause of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sinking. Only 110 men were rescued by the British before reports of U-boats forced them from the scene.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=34\u201335}} A further five men were rescued by German vessels.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=246}}\n\n=== ''Tirpitz'' ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J19316, Norwegen, Schlachtschiff, Zerst\u00f6rer.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' and several destroyers off the Norwegian coast]]\n{{main|German battleship Tirpitz}}\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s first action following her commissioning into the Kriegsmarine on 25 February 1941 was to act as a deterrent to a possible Soviet attempt to break out their [[Baltic Fleet]] following the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]].

The force patrolled off the [[\u00c5land Islands]] for a few days before returning to Kiel.{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} On 14 January 1942, ''Tirpitz'' left German waters for Norway, arriving on the 17th.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} The Germans used the ship as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval forces to protect the convoy route to the Soviet Union and to deter an invasion of Norway.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}}\n\nOn 6 March, ''Tirpitz'', escorted by three destroyers, launched a raid on the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|British convoys to the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} The Germans attempted to intercept convoys PQ-12 and QP-8,{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} but the inclement weather prevented them from finding the convoys.{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} The British located ''Tirpitz'', and the aircraft carrier ''Victorious'' launched a strike of twelve [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers. The aircraft were repulsed without having scored any hits on the German ships. ''Tirpitz'' and the destroyers were back in port by 12 March.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} The close call prompted Hitler to mandate that ''Tirpitz'' was not to attack another convoy unless its escorting aircraft carrier had been sunk or disabled.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}}\n\nOver the next two months, the RAF launched a series of unsuccessful bombing raids against ''Tirpitz'' while she was moored in the [[Faettenfjord]]. The first, by 34 [[Handley Page Halifax]] bombers, took place on 31 March. Two followed a month later, on 28 and 29 April. The first attack was conducted by 43 Halifax and [[Avro Lancaster]] bombers, the second by 34 Halifax and Lancaster.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} A combination of heavy German anti-aircraft fire and poor weather caused all three missions to fail.{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} Over the rest of the year and into late 1942, ''Tirpitz'' underwent a refit in the Faettenfjord, which lacked dockyard facilities of any type. As a result, the work was done incrementally; a large [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built to allow the rudders to be replaced.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin stated that \"the repairs to this ship were one of the most difficult naval engineering feats of World War II.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=256}}\n\nIn January 1943, ''Tirpitz'' emerged from the lengthy overhaul, after which she was transferred to [[Altafjord]]. Here, she participated in extensive training operations with ''Scharnhorst'' and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, which lasted until the middle of the year.{{sfn|Williamson|p=37}} In early September, ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ten destroyers bombarded the island of [[Spitzbergen]], which served as a British refuelling station. The two battleships destroyed their targets and returned safely to Altenfjord; this was the first time ''Tirpitz'' fired her main guns in anger.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} On 22\u201323 September, six [[Operation Source|British midget submarines]] attacked ''Tirpitz'' while at anchor. Two of the submarines successfully planted explosive charges against the battleship's hull, which did serious damage. ''Tirpitz'' had been successfully neutralized.{{sfn|Williamson|p=37}} Over the next six months, a workforce of some 1,000 men effected the needed repairs, which were finished by March 1944.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n[[File:Fleet Air Arm attack the battleship Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' under attack by Barracuda bombers on 3 April]]\n\nThe British resumed the [[List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz|series of air attacks]] almost immediately after repairs were completed. On 3 April, the Royal Navy launched [[Operation Tungsten]], during which 40&nbsp;fighters and 40&nbsp;[[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]] bombers from six carriers attacked the ship. They scored 15 direct hits and two near misses, which caused heavy damage, killed 122 men, and wounded 316 more. The Royal Navy attempted to repeat the attack three weeks later on the 24th, but had to call the operation off due to inclement weather. Operation Brawn, another carrier-launched attack, followed on 15 May, but again weather interfered. Another carrier strike was attempted on 28 May, but it too was cancelled due to poor weather conditions. [[Operation Mascot]], which was to be conducted by the carriers ''Victorious'', ''Furious'', and {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} on 17 July, was frustrated by the heavy smokescreen over the battleship.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=26}}\n\nThe Royal Navy launched the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Operation Goodwood]] series in late August. Goodwood I took place on 22 August, with 38 bombers and 43 fighters from five carriers. The attackers failed to score any hits. Goodwood III followed two days later, with 48 bombers and 29 fighters from {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}}, ''Furious'', and ''Indefatigable''. The bombers made two hits on the ship, which did only minor damage. The last Royal Navy operation, Goodwood IV, followed on 29 August. Thirty-four bombers and 25 fighters, launched from ''Formidable'' and ''Indefatigable'', attacked the ship, though fog prevented them from scoring any hits.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=26}}\n\nThe task of sinking ''Tirpitz'' now fell to the RAF, which performed three airstrikes armed with new {{convert|5400|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Tallboy bomb]]s.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=26}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], came on 15 September, when a force of 27 Lancasters dropped a single Tallboy each; the bombers succeeded in hitting ''Tirpitz'' directly in the bow with one of the bombs. The bomb completely penetrated the ship and exploded directly under her keel. This caused {{convert|1500|MT|abbr=on}} of water to flood the ship; ''Tirpitz'' had again been disabled.{{sfn|Williamson|p=39}} A month later, on 15 October, ''Tirpitz'' was moved to H\u00e5k\u00f8ya Island off [[Troms\u00f8]] to be used as a floating artillery battery. Two weeks later, on 29 October, the British launched [[Operation Obviate]], which consisted of 32 Lancaster bombers. Only a near miss was achieved, though it caused ''Tirpitz'' to take in more water.
