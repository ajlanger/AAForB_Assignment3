He is the son of Jayne (Quinlan), of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent, and John George Costas, an electrical engineer of [[Greek American|Greek]] descent. His father's ancestry can be traced back to the island of [[Kalymnos]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] in Greece. As Costas stated on [[Ken Burns]]' ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'', he had a very poor relationship with his father. Costas graduated from [[Commack School District|Commack High School South]] and attended [[Syracuse University]] in [[Syracuse, New York]]. He graduated with a communications degree in 1974 from their [[S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]].\n\n==Broadcasting career==\n===Early career===\n\nIn 1973, Costas began his professional career at [[WSYR-TV|WSYR TV]] and [[WSYR (AM)|radio]] in Syracuse while still completing his communications degree at the [[S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]]. His sportscasting career began while attending Syracuse University, serving as an announcer for the [[Syracuse Blazers]] minor-league hockey team playing in the [[Eastern Hockey League]] and [[North American Hockey League]].\n\nAfter graduating in 1974 at the age of 22, Costas went to [[KMOX]] radio in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], calling play-by-play for the [[Spirits of St. Louis]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] in 1974. He was a prominent contributor to the ABA book ''[[Loose Balls]]: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association''. He is extensively quoted on many topics. The book includes his reflections of ABA life during his tenure as radio voice of the Spirits of St. Louis.\n\nLater, Costas would call [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri Tigers basketball]] and co-host KMOX's ''Open Line'' call-in program. He did play-by-play for [[Chicago Bulls]] broadcasts on [[WGN-TV]] during the [[1979\u201380 Chicago Bulls season|1979\u20131980 NBA season]].<ref>Database (undated).

This late night show created by [[Dick Ebersol]], coming on at 1:30&nbsp;a.m. as the third program in NBC's nightly lineup after ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', was something of a break from the typical TV talk show format of the era, featuring Costas and a single guest conversing for the entire half hour, without a band, opening monologue or studio audience. On several occasions, Costas held the guest over for multiple nights. The show was taped in [[GE Building]]'s studios 3B or 8H at the [[Rockefeller Center|Rockefeller Plaza]], with Costas interviewing the guest for 45 minutes to an hour before turning the material over to editors who condensed it down to 22 minutes plus commercial breaks.<ref>{{YouTube|pmyB934SsDI|Later 1994}}.</ref> More popular guests were given two- or three-part interviews; in August 1991 [[Mel Brooks]] was the ''only'' guest on ''four'' consecutive nights.

He also turned down an offer from [[David Letterman]], who moved to [[CBS]] in 1995, to follow him there and become the first host of ''[[The Late Late Show (U.S. TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'', which was being developed by Letterman's company to air at 12:30 after the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-01/entertainment/ca-15250_1_late-night|title=TELEVISION : Doesn't Tom Snyder Ever Say Good Night? : The radio-TV veteran returns to the late late-night spot that made him famous.

Costas's call:\n<blockquote>\n'''A base hit to right! Here comes Richardson, they're waving him home! The throw, it's close but he scores! On a walk off hit by Derek Jeter!'''\n</blockquote>\n\n==Interests==\n===Love of baseball===\n\nCostas is a devoted baseball fan. He's been suggested as a potential [[Commissioner of Baseball|commissioner]] and wrote ''Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball'' in [[2000 in literature|2000]]. For his 40th birthday, then [[Oakland Athletics]] manager [[Tony La Russa]] allowed Costas to manage the club during a spring training game. The first time Costas visited baseball legend [[Stan Musial]]'s St. Louis eatery, he left a $3.31 tip on a ten dollar tab in homage to Musial's lifetime batting average (.331). Costas delivered the [[eulogy]] at [[Mickey Mantle]]'s [[funeral]]. In eulogizing Mantle, Costas described the baseball legend as ''\"a fragile hero to whom we had an emotional attachment so strong and lasting that it defied logic\".'' Costas has even carried a [[1958 New York Yankees season|1958]] Mickey Mantle [[baseball card]] in his wallet. Costas also delivered the eulogy for Musial after his death in early 2013.\n\nCostas was outspoken about his disdain for Major League Baseball instituting a playoff [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]]. Costas believed it diminishes the significance and drama of winning a divisional championship. He prefers a system in which winning the wild card puts a team at some sort of disadvantage, as opposed to an equal level with teams who outplayed them over a 162-game season. Or, as explained in his book ''Fair Ball'', have only the three division winners in each league go to the postseason, with the team with the best record receiving a bye to the League Championship Series. Once, on the air on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Inside the NFL]]'', he mentioned that the NFL regular season counted for something, but baseball's was beginning to lose significance. With the advent of the second wild card, Costas has said he feels the format has improved, since there is now a greater premium placed on finishing first. He has suggested a further tweak: Make the wild card round a best two of three, instead of a single game, with all three games, if necessary, on the homefield of the wild card of the better record.\n\nHe also has disdained the [[Designated Hitter]] rule, saying baseball would be a better game without it.<ref>https://jugssports.com/blog/is-it-time-to-get-rid-of-the-designated-hitteror-expand-it-to-the-national-league/</ref>\n\nCostas serves as a member of the advisory board of the [[Baseball Assistance Team]], a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League players through financial and medical difficulties.\n\n===Political views===\n\nOn May 26, 2007, Costas discussed the presidency of [[George W.

He is the son of Jayne (Quinlan), of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent, and John George Costas, an electrical engineer of [[Greek American|Greek]] descent. His father's ancestry can be traced back to the island of [[Kalymnos]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] in Greece. As Costas stated on [[Ken Burns]]' ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'', he had a very poor relationship with his father. Costas graduated from [[Commack School District|Commack High School South]] and attended [[Syracuse University]] in [[Syracuse, New York]]. He graduated with a communications degree in 1974 from their [[S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]].\n\n==Broadcasting career==\n===Early career===\n\nIn 1973, Costas began his professional career at [[WSYR-TV|WSYR TV]] and [[WSYR (AM)|radio]] in Syracuse while still completing his communications degree at the [[S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]]. His sportscasting career began while attending Syracuse University, serving as an announcer for the [[Syracuse Blazers]] minor-league hockey team playing in the [[Eastern Hockey League]] and [[North American Hockey League]].\n\nAfter graduating in 1974 at the age of 22, Costas went to [[KMOX]] radio in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], calling play-by-play for the [[Spirits of St. Louis]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] in 1974. He was a prominent contributor to the ABA book ''[[Loose Balls]]: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association''. He is extensively quoted on many topics. The book includes his reflections of ABA life during his tenure as radio voice of the Spirits of St. Louis.\n\nLater, Costas would call [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri Tigers basketball]] and co-host KMOX's ''Open Line'' call-in program. He did play-by-play for [[Chicago Bulls]] broadcasts on [[WGN-TV]] during the [[1979\u201380 Chicago Bulls season|1979\u20131980 NBA season]].<ref>Database (undated).

Game{{nbsp}}2 of the NLCS took place on Thursday, October 5, which was an off day for the ALCS. NBC then decided to fly Costas from Toronto to Chicago to substitute for Scully on Thursday night.

Costas's call:\n<blockquote>'''A base hit to right! Here comes Richardson, they're waving him home! The throw, it's close but he scores! On a walk off hit by Derek Jeter!'''</blockquote>\n\n==Interests==\n===Love of baseball===\n\nCostas is a devoted baseball fan. He's been suggested as a potential [[Commissioner of Baseball|commissioner]] and wrote ''Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball'' in [[2000 in literature|2000]]. For his 40th birthday, then [[Oakland Athletics]] manager [[Tony La Russa]] allowed Costas to manage the club during a spring training game. The first time Costas visited baseball legend [[Stan Musial]]'s St. Louis eatery, he left a $3.31 tip on a ten dollar tab in homage to Musial's lifetime batting average (.331). Costas delivered the [[eulogy]] at [[Mickey Mantle]]'s [[funeral]]. In eulogizing Mantle, Costas described the baseball legend as ''\"a fragile hero to whom we had an emotional attachment so strong and lasting that it defied logic\".'' Costas has even carried a [[1958 New York Yankees season|1958]] Mickey Mantle [[baseball card]] in his wallet. Costas also delivered the eulogy for Musial after his death in early 2013.\n\nCostas was outspoken about his disdain for Major League Baseball instituting a playoff [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]]. Costas believed it diminishes the significance and drama of winning a divisional championship. He prefers a system in which winning the wild card puts a team at some sort of disadvantage, as opposed to an equal level with teams who outplayed them over a 162-game season. Or, as explained in his book ''Fair Ball'', have only the three division winners in each league go to the postseason, with the team with the best record receiving a bye to the League Championship Series. Once, on the air on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Inside the NFL]]'', he mentioned that the NFL regular season counted for something, but baseball's was beginning to lose significance. With the advent of the second wild card, Costas has said he feels the format has improved, since there is now a greater premium placed on finishing first. He has suggested a further tweak: Make the wild card round a best two of three, instead of a single game, with all three games, if necessary, on the homefield of the wild card of the better record.\n\nHe also has disdained the [[Designated Hitter]] rule, saying baseball would be a better game without it.<ref>https://jugssports.com/blog/is-it-time-to-get-rid-of-the-designated-hitteror-expand-it-to-the-national-league/</ref>\n\nCostas serves as a member of the advisory board of the [[Baseball Assistance Team]], a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League players through financial and medical difficulties.\n\n===Political views===\n\nOn May 26, 2007, Costas discussed the presidency of [[George W. Bush]] on his radio show, stating he liked Bush personally, and had been optimistic about his presidency, but said the course of the Iraq war, and other mis-steps have led him to conclude Bush's presidency had \"tragically failed\" and considered it \"overwhelmingly evident, even if you're a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], if you're honest about it, this is a failed administration.\"<ref>''Costas on the Radio'', May 26, 2007.</ref> The following summer, Costas interviewed Bush during the president's appearance at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.<ref name=\"ostrow2008\">{{cite news|last=Ostrow|first=Joanne| date = August 10, 2008 | title=Bob Costas, redeemed |url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2008/08/10/bob-costas-redeemed/215/| publisher = Ostrow Off the Record (blog of [[The Denver Post]]) |accessdate= August 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n===Gun culture controversy===\n\nDuring a segment on the ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' halftime show on December 2, 2012, Costas paraphrased [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] columnist [[Jason Whitlock]] in regard to [[Jovan Belcher]]'s murder-suicide the day prior, saying the United States' [[Gun culture#Present-day gun culture in the United States|gun culture]] was causing more [[domestic violence|domestic dispute]]s to result in death, and that it was likely Belcher and his girlfriend would not have died had he not possessed a gun.<ref name=bi-costasbelcher>{{cite web|title=Bob Costas Got Blasted For His Gun-Control Monologue After Jovan Belcher's Murder-Suicide|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bob-costas-gun-control-jovan-belcher-chiefs-murder-suicide-kasandra-perkins-2012-12|website=Business Insider|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCritics interpreted his remarks as support for [[gun control]], resulting in mostly negative reactions. Many (including former Republican Presidential candidates [[Mike Huckabee]] and [[Herman Cain]])<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc/> felt Costas should not have used a program typically viewed as entertainment to publicize political views on sensitive topics, [[Lou Dobbs]] criticized his remarks for supporting the abolition of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] by quoting a [[sports writer]], while [[Andrew Levy]] remarked that he had been given a civics lecture by someone who had \"gotten rich thanks in part to a sport that destroys men's bodies and brains\".<ref name=nydn-costasguns>{{cite news|title=Bob Costas delivers anti-gun message on Sunday Night Football one day after NFL player Jovan Belcher kills girlfriend, himself|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/costas-delivers-anti-gun-message-sunday-night-football-article-1.1212138|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref> However, liberal reporter [[Erik Wemple]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised Costas for speaking out for gun control on the broadcast, commenting that the incident's connection to the NFL provided him with an obligation to acknowledge the incident during the halftime show, stating that \"the things that [NFL players] do affect the public beyond whether their teams cover the point spread.

Costas did suggest that more regulation be placed on America's gun culture:<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc>{{cite news|last=Pengelly|first=Martin|title=Bob Costas defends 'gun culture' comments in MSNBC interview|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/05/bob-costas-gun-comments-msnbc-interview|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=9 December 2012|location=London|date=December 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Now, do I believe that we need more comprehensive and more sensible gun control legislation? Yes I do. That doesn't mean repeal the Second Amendment. That doesn't mean a prohibition on someone having a gun to protect their home and their family. It means sensible and more comprehensive gun control legislation. But even if you had that, you would still have the problem of what Jason Whitlock wrote about, and what I agree with. And that is a gun culture in this country.<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc/></blockquote>\n\n===2014 Winter Olympics===\n\nDuring his coverage of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], Costas was criticized by some conservative members of the media, including [[Michelle Malkin]] and [[Glenn Beck]] for supposedly praising [[Vladimir Putin]]'s role in defusing tensions surrounding Syria, and Iran.<ref name=\"NBC Steers Clear\">{{cite news|last1=Farhi|first1=Paul|title=In coverage of Olympics, NBC has largely steered clear of controversy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/olympics/in-coverage-of-olympics-nbc-has-largely-steered-clear-of-controversy/2014/02/21/5e68a088-99aa-11e3-80ac-63a8ba7f7942_story.html|accessdate=28 October 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=February 21, 2014}}</ref> Several media commentators, including [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Bernard Goldberg]], defended Costas' remarks as factually correct and pointed out that Costas had also voiced considerable criticism of both Russia and Putin while broadcasting from [[Sochi]].

However, the network announced shortly before the game that [[Liam McHugh]] would instead join [[Dan Patrick]] as a co-host, leading to speculation that NBC removed Costas from the NFL's biggest game over his comments.
