Mahim, or Mahikawati as it was known, was the capital of [[Bhima of Mahikavati|Raja Bhimdev]], who reigned over the region in the 13th century. He built a palace and a court of justice in [[Prabhadevi]], as well as the first [[Babulnath]] temple.\n\n[[File:Mahim Dargah 4.jpg|thumb|[[Dargah]] of Mahimi in Mahim]]\nIn 1343, this island was possessed by the [[Sultanate of Gujarat]]. It was in their reign that the old Mahim mosque was built. A dargah of Makhtum Fakir Ali Paru was built here in 1431.\n\nIn 1543, the Portuguese captured the islands of Mumbai. In 1662, these islands were given to the English King, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], as a part of the wedding dowry for the Portuguese princess, [[Catherine of Braganza]]. After British acquired Mumbai, they built the [[Mahim Fort]] here to protect themselves from the Marathas. The fort today stands in ruins.\n\nThe causeway connecting Mahim and Bandra (corrupted from \"Bunder\" meaning port in Persian) was completed in 1845 at a cost of Rs. 1,57,000 donated entirely by Lady [[Avabai Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy]], wife of the first [[baronet]] Sir [[Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy]] with a stipulation that no toll would be charged to citizens for its use by the government.\n\nIn 1847, a small group of Scottish missionaries decided to start a new school, now one of the most high-profile schools in Mumbai \u2014 the [[Bombay Scottish School]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Bwsl night222.jpg|thumb|[[Bandra Worli Sea Link]] across Mahim Bay]]\nMahim is surrounded by [[Dharavi]], [[Dadar]] and [[Bandra]] on the north and the [[Arabian Sea]] on the west.\n\n===Schools and educational institutions===\n\nMahim has a number of schools and educational institutions.

The southern end is [[Worli]], the northern end is [[Bandra]] Reclamation and Mahim is in the centre. The bay was named after the islands of Mahim and [[Salsette]] were merged in the early 19th century. The [[Mithi River]] drains into [[Mahim Creek]].\n\nDuring the colonial era, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] built a watchtower called [[Castella de Aguada]] on the northern side. Later, the [[British Empire|British]] built the [[Worli Fort]] to the south and [[Mahim Fort]] near the creek to defend the [[seven islands of Bombay]] against attacks by the Portuguese and the [[Marathas]]. The [[Bandra-Worli Sealink]] crosses Mahim Bay.\n\n=== Mahimchi Khadi (Mahim Creek) ===\n[[File:Mahim creek.jpg|thumb|right|Mahim Creek]]\nMahim Creek is a {{Convert|15|ft|m}} deep [[creek (tidal)|creek]]. The [[Mithi River]] drains into the creek which drains into the Mahim Bay. It forms the boundary between the [[Mumbai City|city]] and [[Mumbai Suburban District|suburbs]]. The creek is swamped by [[mangrove]]s and has a mini-ecosystem.\n\nIt now has the [[Bandra-Kurla complex]] with corporate offices on both its sides.\n\nThe waters of the creek are foul smelling due to the dumping of untreated industrial effluents upstream. In recent years, the mushrooming of slums around the waters has caused concern for the mangrove ecosystem, vital to the ecosystem of Mumbai.\n\nIn 2006, it was the site of [[2006 Mumbai \"Sweet\" Seawater Incident|mass hysteria]] as thousands claimed its waters had turned \"sweet.\"\n\n== Mahim Causeway ==\n[[File:Mahim Causeway 2.jpg|thumb|The Mahim Causeway, Koliwada Creek Bridge]]\nThe [[Mahim Causeway]] is a vital link road connecting the neighborhoods of Mahim in [[South Mumbai]] to [[Bandra]] in West Mumbai.\n\nThe Mahim Causeway was built between 1841 and 1846 to connect the island of Salsette with Mahim. The swampy area between the two islands made travel dangerous and thus a need for a causeway arose. The [[British East India Company]], which governed Bombay at that time, refused to fund the project. This led [[Avabai Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy|Lady Jeejeebhoy]], wife of the first baronet Sir [[Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy]], to donate the entire amount of {{INR}}157,000/- <!-- NUMBERING SYSTEM IS CORRECT!

It is not to be confused with the [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]], a major infrastructural project opened on 30 June 2009 which is designed to ease traffic across the causeway by building another bridge across the Mahim Bay.\n\n== Mahim Fort ==\n[[File:Mahim Fort 13.jpg|thumb|Mahim Fort]]\n[[Mahim Fort]], which was once visible from the Mahim Causeway and Bandra Reclamation, is barely visible now. The Mahim Fort along with Fort St George in South Mumbai was an important base during the time of the British Empire. Other forts in Mumbai and [[Salsette Island]] include [[Sion, India|Sion]], [[Worli]], [[Sewri]] and [[Mazgaon]]. Fort St George was built in 1669, by the former Governor of Bombay, Gerald Aungier.\n\nThomas Grantham then strengthened the fort's ramparts in 1684. In 1772, 111 years after Bombay was taken from them, the Portuguese attempted to attack this fort. The British replied fiercely with cannonballs. The Bandra church also bore the brunt of their fire. There were about 100 soldiers and 30 cannons in the Mahim Fort at that time.\n\nToday the fort is almost ruined and encroachers and hutments occupy it.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Mahim}}\n* [[Makhdoom Ali Mahimi]]\n* [[St. Michael's Church (Mumbai)]]\n* [[Mithi River]]\n* [[Back Bay (Mumbai)|Back Bay]]\n* [[Mahim Causeway]]\n* [[Mahim halwa]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Mumbai metropolitan area}}\n\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods in Mumbai]]\n[[Category:Mumbai City district]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=July 2017}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Mahim\n| native_name             =\n| native_name_lang        = \n| other_name              = \n| settlement_type         = Neighbourhood\n| image_skyline           = Mahim bay skyline.jpg\n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = Mahim Bay\n| nickname                = \n| map_alt                 = \n| map_caption             = \n| pushpin_map             = Mumbai#Maharashtra#India\n| pushpin_label_position  = \n| pushpin_map_alt         = \n| pushpin_map_caption     = \n| coordinates             = {{coord|19.035|N|72.84|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = [[India]]\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Maharashtra]]\n| subdivision_type2       = Metro\n| subdivision_name2       = Mumbai\n| established_title       = <!-- Established -->\n| established_date        = \n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| government_type         = \n| governing_body          = \n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| area_footnotes          = \n| area_rank               = \n| area_total_km2          = \n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = \n| population_total        = \n| population_as_of        = \n| population_rank         = \n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_demonym      = Mahimkar\n| population_footnotes    = \n| demographics_type1      = Languages\n| demographics1_title1    = Official\n| demographics1_info1     = [[Marathi language|Marathi]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = <!-- [[Postal Index Number|PIN]] -->\n| postal_code             = \n| registration_plate      = \n| website                 = \n| footnotes               = \n}}\n'''Mahim''' is a neighbourhood in [[Mumbai]], [[India]].
