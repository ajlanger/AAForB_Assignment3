Of note, only approximately 10% of filtered magnesium is absorbed in the proximal tubule, whereas most of the filtered magnesium gets passively reabsorbed in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This factor is essential for the pathophysiology of kidney-related hypermagnesemia as along the loop of Henle, not only the volume of the filtrate gets reduced, but also the osmolarity decreases significantly (-66%), and consequently the solutes become less concentrated. Furthermore, this explains the high resorbent capacity of the kidney, which generally maintains magnesium equilibrium until the creatinine clearance falls below 20 ml/min. Thus, an increase in plasma magnesium levels is practically impossible to achieve with diet alone in conditions of perfect renal health. However, the odds of hypermagnesemia can increase by taking mega-doses of magnesium. The pathophysiology of hypermagnesemia related to excess laxative use is different. In this case, the huge amount of magnesium given through the digestive tract can lead to overwhelming the excretory mechanism, especially in cases with underlying subclinical renal failure.<ref name=stats/>\n\nMagnesium works as a physiologic calcium blocker. Increased levels determine substantial electrophysiological and hemodynamic effects. Moreover, the potential concomitance of hyperkalemia increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. The neurologic manifestations are the result of the inhibition of acetylcholine release from the neuromuscular endplate due to increased extracellular magnesium levels.\n\n==Causes==\nMagnesium status depends on three organs: uptake in the [[intestine]], storage in the [[bone]], and excretion in the [[kidneys]].

Concentrations of magnesium greater than 1.1&nbsp;mmol/L are considered diagnostic.<ref name=EU2010/>\n\n==Treatment==\nPeople with normal [[kidney function]] (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over 60 ml/min) and mild asymptomatic hypermagnesemia require no treatment except the removal of all sources of exogenous magnesium. One must consider that the half-time of elimination of magnesium is approximately 28 hours.\n\nIn more severe cases, close monitoring of the ECG, blood pressure, and neuromuscular function and early treatment are necessary:\n\nIntravenous calcium gluconate or chloride [Dosage: 1 g in 2 to 5 min (repeatable over 5 minutes)]. The rationale is that the actions of magnesium in neuromuscular and cardiac function become antagonized by calcium. Intravenous normal saline (e.g., at 150 ml/hour)\n\nSevere clinical conditions require increasing renal magnesium excretion through:\n\nIntravenous loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide 1 mg/kg), or hemodialysis, when kidney function is impaired, or the patient is symptomatic from severe hypermagnesemia. This approach usually removes magnesium efficiently (up to 50% reduction after a 3- to 4-hour treatment). Dialysis can, however, increase the excretion of calcium by developing hypocalcemia, thus possibly worsening the symptoms and signs of hypermagnesaemia.\n\nThe use of diuretics must be associated with infusions of saline solutions to avoid further electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia) and metabolic alkalosis. The clinician must perform serial measurements of calcium and magnesium. In association with electrolytic correction, it is often necessary to support cardiorespiratory activity. As a consequence, the treatment of this electrolyte disorder can frequently require intensive care unit (ICU) admission.\n\nParticular clinical conditions require a specific approach. For instance, during the management of eclampsia, the magnesium infusion is stopped if urine output drops to less than 80 mL (in 4 hours), deep tendon reflexes are absent, or the respiratory rate is below 12 breaths/minute. A 10% calcium gluconate or chloride solution (10 mL intravenously repeatable over 5 minutes) can serve as an antidote.<ref name=stats/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nHypermagnesemia is an uncommon electrolyte disorder. It occurs in approximately 10 to 15% of hospitalized patients with renal failure. Furthermore, epidemiological data suggest that there is a significant prevalence of high levels of serum magnesium in selected healthy populations. For instance the overall prevalence of hypermagnesemia was 3.0%, especially in males in Iran. For instance high magnesium concentrations were typical in people with cardiovascular disease, and 2.3 mg/dL or higher values were associated with worse hospital mortality.<ref name=stats/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe prognosis of hypermagnesemia depends on magnesium values and on the clinical condition that induced hypermagnesemia. Values that are not excessively high (mild hypermagnesemia) and in the absence of triggering and aggravating conditions (e.g., renal insufficiency) are benign conditions. On the contrary, high values (severe hypermagnesemia) expose the patient to high risks and high mortality.<ref name=stats/>\n\n==Complications==\nSevere hypermagnesemia (levels greater than 12 mmol/dL) can lead to cardiovascular complications (hypotension, and arrhythmias) and neurological disorder (confusion and lethargy). Higher values of serum magnesium (exceeding 15 mg/dL) can induce cardiorespiratory arrest and coma. <ref name=stats/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 6259\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|E|83|4|e|70}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|275.2}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = \n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = med\n| eMedicineTopic  = 3383\n| eMedicine_mult  = {{eMedicine2|emerg|262}} {{eMedicine2|ped|1080}}\n| MeshID          = \n| ICD10CM         = {{ICD10CM|E83.41}}\n}}\n\n{{Mineral metabolic pathology}}\n\n[[Category:Electrolyte disturbances]]\n[[Category:Magnesium]]\n[[Category:Nephrology]]\n[[Category:Toxic effects of metals]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Hypermagnesemia\n| synonyms        = \n| image           = Mg-TableImage.svg\n| caption         = [[Magnesium]]\n| pronounce       = \n| field           = [[Endocrinology]]\n| symptoms        = [[Weakness]], [[confusion]], [[respiratory depression|decreased breathing rate]]<ref name=EU2010/>\n| complications   = [[Cardiac arrest]]<ref name=EU2010/>\n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = [[Kidney failure]], [[iatrogenic|treatment induced]], [[tumor lysis syndrome]], [[seizures]], prolonged [[ischemia]]<ref name=EU2010/><ref name=Ron2017/>\n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = Blood level > 1.1&nbsp;mmol/L (2.6&nbsp;mg/dL)<ref name=EU2010/><ref name=Mer2018/>\n| differential    = Acute kidney failure, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hypoparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, lithium toxicity, hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis<ref name=stats>{{cite journal | authors = Cascella M, Vaqar S. | title = Hypermagnesemia. | journal = Statspearl | date = 2020 | pmid =31747218 }}</ref>\n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = [[Calcium chloride]], [[intravenous normal saline]] with [[furosemide]], [[hemodialysis]]<ref name=EU2010/>\n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = Uncommon<ref name=Mer2018/>\n| deaths          = \n}}\n<!-- Diagnosis and symptoms -->\n'''Hypermagnesemia''' is an [[electrolyte disorder]] in which there is a high level of [[magnesium]] in the blood.<ref name=Mer2018>{{cite web |title=Hypermagnesemia |url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/endocrine-and-metabolic-disorders/electrolyte-disorders/hypermagnesemia |website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition |accessdate=28 October 2018}}</ref> Symptoms include [[weakness]], [[confusion]], [[respiratory depression|decreased breathing rate]], and [[hyporeflexia|decreased reflexes]].<ref name=EU2010/><ref name=Mer2018/> Complications may include [[low blood pressure]] and [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name=EU2010/><ref name=Ed2011/>\n\n<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->\nIt is typically caused by [[kidney failure]] or is [[iatrogenic|treatment induced]] such as from [[antacids]] that contain magnesium.<ref name=EU2010/><ref>{{cite book| first1=Andrea, M.P.| last1=Romani|editor=Astrid Sigel|editor2=Helmut Sigel|editor3=Roland K.

For instance high magnesium concentrations were typical in people with cardiovascular disease, and 2.3 mg/dL or higher values were associated with worse hospital mortality.<ref name=stats/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe prognosis of hypermagnesemia depends on magnesium values and on the clinical condition that induced hypermagnesemia. Values that are not excessively high (mild hypermagnesemia) and in the absence of triggering and aggravating conditions (e.g., renal insufficiency) are benign conditions. On the contrary, high values (severe hypermagnesemia) expose the patient to high risks and high mortality.<ref name=stats/>\n\n==Complications==\nSevere hypermagnesemia (levels greater than 12 mmol/dL) can lead to cardiovascular complications (hypotension, and arrhythmias) and neurological disorder (confusion and lethargy). Higher values of serum magnesium (exceeding 15 mg/dL) can induce cardiorespiratory arrest and coma. <ref name=stats/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 6259 \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|E|83|4|e|70}} \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|275.2}} \n|  ICDO           = \n|  OMIM           = \n|  MedlinePlus    = \n|  eMedicineSubj  = med \n|  eMedicineTopic = 3383 \n|  eMedicine_mult = {{eMedicine2|emerg|262}} {{eMedicine2|ped|1080}} \n|  MeshID         =\n}}\n\n{{Mineral metabolic pathology}}\n\n[[Category:Electrolyte disturbances]]\n[[Category:Magnesium]]\n[[Category:Nephrology]]\n[[Category:Toxic effects of metals]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermagnesemia"}
