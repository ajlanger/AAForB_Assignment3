Under the [[Faculty of Arts and Sciences]], individual courses among the school's [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] and professional offerings, a number of which have [[Harvard College]] equivalents, are open-enrollment. However, the Extension School also offers [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate degrees]], [[Graduate school|graduate degrees]], and [[Academic certificate|certificates]] in more than 60 fields of study, provided that a qualifying test is passed, satisfactory grades are obtained in prior Harvard coursework, and a formal application is accepted. Degree candidates and alumni enjoy access to Harvard's many amenities and opportunities.\n\nThe school offers on-campus, online, and hybrid courses. It also offers a pre-medical program for students needing specific coursework to apply to medical school. The school is primarily intended for nontraditional adult learners.\n\nSince its establishment in 1910, an estimated 500,000 students have taken courses at the Extension School. Of these, 0.18% earned a degree.{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=214}}\n\n==History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left:1em\"\n|-\n! Year<ref name=\"gates\" /> !!

Lawrence Lowell]], the Harvard Extension School grew out of the [[Lowell Institute]], which was created according to the terms of a bequest by John Lowell, Jr.  It was designed to serve the educational interests and needs of the greater [[Boston]] community,{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=220}} particularly those \"who had the ability and desire to attend college, but also had other obligations that kept them from traditional schools.\"<ref name=\"sampler\" />  It has since extended its academic resources to the public, locally, nationally, and internationally.\n\nDuring the 1920s [[professor]]s from [[Boston University]] and [[Harvard University]] traveled to teach courses offsite.<ref name=\"Yonkers\" /> While they were primarily aimed at teachers, courses were offered wherever 40 or more students expressed an interest.<ref name=\"Yonkers\" />  Professors traveled on a weekly basis to places around New England and as far away as [[Yonkers, New York]],<ref name=\"Yonkers\" /> some 200 miles away.\n\nIn the early years courses were run by a commission composed of several Boston area schools, though it was largely a Harvard-run program.<ref name=\"wheat\" />{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=54}}{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=104}}  In 1938 there were 28 professors from Commission faculties, including 11 full professors.<ref name=\"courses\" />  Early faculty included [[Charles Townsend Copeland]], [[William Yandell Elliot]], [[William L. Langer]], [[Oscar Handlin]], [[Perry Miller]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], and [[Frank M. Carpenter]].{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=52}} In 1953 there was a similar number of professors.<ref name=\"wheat\" />\n\nIn his will, John Lowell asked his successors to set up courses \"more erudite and particular corresponding to the age and wants of the age.\"<ref name=\"wheat\" />  By the 50th anniversary of the University Extension in 1960, more than 1,400 courses had been offered and there had been more than 85,000 enrollments.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=81}} Lowell's bequest limited the cost of tuition to no more than two bushels of wheat. During the [[Great Depression]] this amounted to roughly $5 per semester course.{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=50}}\n\nSeveral years after retiring, President Lowell wrote that the Extension courses \"have given a service to the public&nbsp;... which seems to me of the utmost importance.\"{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=225}}  In 2013, more than 100 years after its founding, the Extension School's classes were described as \"surprisingly affordable\"<ref name=\"fodors\" /> and the school itself was said to be a \"thriving institution.\"<ref name=\"fortune\" />\n\n===Degree development===\nThe Extension School currently offers two degrees (and has offered these degrees since 1979): the [[Bachelor of Liberal Arts]] in Extension Studies (ALB) and the [[Master of Liberal Arts]] in Extension Studies (ALM).<ref name=\"century\" />  From 1911 to 1933, the school offered an Associate in Arts, and from 1933 to 1960, it offered an Adjunct in Arts.<ref name=\"century\" />  Both were considered the [[History of Harvard Extension School#Extension grows|equivalent of a bachelor's degree]].<ref name=\"century\" /> From 1971 to 2014, the school offered an Associate of Arts in Extension Studies (AA), the equivalent of a two-year degree.<ref name=\"century\" />\n\nA proposal before the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 2009 and 2010 to rename the school and the degrees offered was not accepted.<ref name=\"sinjin\" /><ref name=\"rename\" />  A committee led by Professor of Computer Science [[Harry R. Lewis]] proposed renaming the school the \"Harvard School of Continuing and Professional Studies\" and dropping the words \"in Extension Studies\" from degrees so that the school would offer Bachelor of Liberal Arts, Master of Liberal Arts, and Master of Professional Studies degrees. Some faculty objected, saying that those degrees were too similar to degrees already offered by the College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.<ref name=\"rename\" />\n\nIn 2016, a student group calling itself the Harvard Extension Degree Change Initiative rallied in front of [[University Hall (Harvard University)|University Hall]] to call for removing \u201cExtension Studies\u201d from the degree name and adding a student's field of study instead.<ref name=\"extendingDegree\" /> ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' editorialized in favor, urging Harvard to \"consider changing the title of Extension School degrees to include the field of study rather than the ambiguous 'Extension Studies.'\"<ref name=\"extendingDegree\" /> While the school retains \"Extension Studies\" in official degree titles, transcripts reflect students' area of academic concentration.\n\nIn 2019, Dean [[Huntington D.

Students take courses with Harvard affiliates (instructors have included [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates]]), as well as faculty from other Boston-area universities, business professionals, and community leaders in various fields.<ref name=\"Practical\" /> The number of courses offered has continuously grown over the school's history.\n\nSome of the courses at the Extension School are \"virtually identical\"<ref name=\"Practical\" /><ref name=\"felder\" /> to courses offered to the traditional students at [[Harvard College]], with \"the only significant difference\" being that many of the classes are taught in the evening or at night instead of during the day.<ref name=\"Practical\" /> Ropes, the school's first dean, said that \"our aim will be to give the young people of Boston who have heretofore been prevented from securing a college education the same instruction they would receive were they undergraduates at Harvard.\"{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=30}} \n\nMany daytime Harvard College courses are recorded and offered to Extension students online. For these courses, office hours and other student support are typically offered using live or asynchronous software. Additionally, Extension students are offered the option to attend class lectures for these dual-listed courses on campus. Extension degree candidates who meet required criteria may also apply for \"Special Student status\" to enroll for up to two courses in Harvard College, Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, or another Harvard Graduate School.<ref name=\"Tv75F\" /> The majority of instructors at the school, 52%, are Harvard affiliates; 48% are faculty from other schools and industry professionals.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\nStudents may enroll full or part-time, and classes may be taken on campus, via distance-learning, or both. In order to earn an academic degree, students must complete a minimum number of on-campus-only credits at Harvard.{{efn|n.b. These requirements vary for each degree, from 4 classes in residency for the ALB or the ALM/Biology, two semesters residency requirement for the general ALM, and up to 50% residency requirement for the ALM/Management. It is therefore not possible to receive an academic degree solely through distance learning.}}\n\nNon-degree students have access to the [[Harvard Library]], including electronic resources and select computer facilities.<ref name=\"resources\" /> Those registered for a course at the Extension School may also access writing tutorials at the Writing Center as well as assistance with math and related courses at the Math Question Center.<ref name=\"resources\" /><ref name=\"KrErQ\" /><ref name=\"Hq1IU\" /> Career services and academic advising are offered through the school's Career and Academic Resource Center.<ref name=\"resources\" /><ref name=\"DW0rC\" />\n\n===Accreditation and partnerships===\nHarvard Extension School is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] as one of the twelve degree-granting schools of [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"young\" />\n\nThe Extension School and [[Harvard Business School]] have together created the HBX Credential of Readiness (CORe) program.<ref name=\"sean\" /><ref name=\"hbx\" /> Having begun in 2014, this program allows undergraduate students at the Extension School to take courses with Business School professors for credit.<ref name=\"sean\" /><ref name=\"hbx\" />\n\nThe graduate program in Museum Studies has developed a partnership with the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref name=\"smithsonian\" /> The new courses include two active learning weekends in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"smithsonian\" /> The Extension School is also looking into partnerships with the [[Harvard T.H.

New Englanders could go to college six nights a week at 7:30 in their living rooms simply by tuning into courses on psychology, world history, and economics.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=70}} The first course on radio was by Peter A. Bertocci of Boston University. For 30 years he taught Extension courses, with never fewer than 100 students. He often taught over 300 students per course and once had over 400. Over the years Bertocci taught at least 7,000 Extension students, a record for the school.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=71}}\n\nThe radio courses proved to be so successful that when the television station [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] went on the air in October 1951 they began broadcasting an Extension class every weekday at 3:30 and 7:30.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=72}} The first course, offered by [[Robert G. Albion]], was on European Imperialism on Monday and Thursday evenings.<ref name=\"Albion\" /> In the late 1960s, three of the televised courses were offered in the [[Deer Island Prison]].{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=102}} Students who watched the courses on television could attend six \"conferences\" and take a mid-term and a final exam at Harvard in order to gain credit for the class.<ref name=\"Albion\" />\n\n====Contemporary====\n{{As of|2014}}, distance-learning courses at Harvard Extension School are offered in two formats: asynchronous video courses (lectures are recorded and uploaded within 24 hours of on-campus class meetings); and live web-conference courses (courses are streamed live, and typically allow for synchronous participation from students via a secondary online platform).\n\nThe first online courses were offered in 1997.<ref name=\"serve\" />  Between 2013 and 2016, the number of online classes grew from 200 to more than 450.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\n===Awards and honors===\nThe Dean's Prize for Outstanding Master of Liberal Arts thesis is awarded during [[Graduation|commencement ceremonies]], and includes a medal, a certificate, and a monetary award. It is awarded to a student whose graduate thesis \"embodies the highest level of imaginative scholarship.\"<ref name=\"outstanding\" /> In addition to the Dean's Prize for Outstanding ALM Thesis, there are several other academic prizes:<ref name=\"awards\" /><ref name=\"N841C\" />\n\n*The Academy of American Poets is awarded to an ALB candidate or an undergraduate student at the college for the best poem or group of poems.\n*The Santo J. Aurelio Prize is awarded to an ALB degree recipient aged 50 or older; this prize acknowledges distinguished and unique records of academic achievement and character.\n*The [[Derek Bok Public Service Prizes]] are awards presented at Commencement. They consist of a cash prize along with a citation and a medal given to graduating Extension School students. The award recognizes creative initiatives in community service or long-standing records of civic achievement.<ref name=\"honors\" />\n*The Commencement Speaker Prize is awarded to either an ALB or ALM graduate who delivers the student Commencement speech at the Extension School diploma awarding ceremony.\n*The Annamae and Allan R. Crite Prize is awarded to ALM (liberal arts field) or ALB graduates who concentrate in visual arts or other artistic fields on the basis of academic achievement and dedication to learning and the arts.\n*The Klein Family History Prize recognizes the thesis in the field of history that represents superior achievement in historical scholarship. \n*The Harold Langlois Award recognizes an ALM management or finance graduate who has demonstrated exceptional academic accomplishment and promise as a manager. Based upon highest cumulative GPA.\n*The Patrick Lee Award in Drama is an annual award given to the student who shows the best promise in the field of dramatic arts.\n*The Reginald H. Phelps Prize, named for the former dean, is awarded annually on the basis of \"academic achievement and character\" to outstanding graduating students receiving bachelor's degrees.\n*The John Osborne Sargent Prize for a Latin Translation is offered for the best metrical translation [students may choose meter] of a lyric poem of Horace, to be selected each year by the Department of the Classics. In addition to ALB candidates, it is also open to undergraduates at the College and visiting undergraduates under the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\n*The Thomas Small Prize is named for a Lithuanian immigrant who, at the age of 89, became the oldest earned graduate degree recipient in the history of Harvard University. Two prizes are awarded annually on the basis \"academic achievement and character\" to two outstanding Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies degree recipients.\n* The Judith Wood Memorial Prizes are awarded during Commencement Week to Harvard Extension School students who, while compiling honors academic records at the school, also contended with disabilities of a serious nature. It was established in honor of a blind Extension Student student who had cystic fibrosis and diabetes to recognize students who must travel a singularly difficult path to degree or certificate completion. \n*The Katie Y.F. Yang Prize is awarded annually to the international ALM management or finance graduate with the most outstanding academic record.\n\n==Degree programs==\nTo be eligible to apply to the Extension School's degree programs, students must \"earn [their] way in\" by passing the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills as well as completing two or three designated admission classes with a B or better.<ref name=\"serve\" /> In 2016, Dean [[Huntington D. Lambert]] said that 32% of those who want to pursue an undergraduate degree (ALB) earn the grades necessary for admission, making admissions \"very selective.\"<ref name=\"serve\" />\nIf the admission requirements are met, acceptance is not guaranteed but very likely. About 85% of those admitted successfully earn their degree (ALB).<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\nIt has been estimated that acceptance into the graduate programs (ALM), using the number of accepted students and the number of students enrolled in admission courses, is 15-20%. Thus, based on traditional metrics, admission into the graduate programs is highly selective.\n\nALB students may graduate ''cum laude'', but ''magna''- and ''summa''- ''cum laude'' are not offered. Extension students may earn the Dean's List Academic Achievement Award upon graduation based on a high GPA (at least 3.5 for ALB, 3.8 for ALM).<ref name=\"RFSwK\" /> Many courses are offered online, but a degree cannot be earned entirely online as students are required to take classes on campus before earning their degree.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\nStudents who wish to earn degrees must be formally admitted to the Extension School by the Admissions Committee.<ref name=\"open\" />  Admitted degree candidates are granted full privileges to Harvard's libraries, facilities, student resources, as well as access to Harvard's museums and academic workshops. In 2016, an undergraduate degree cost around $40,000, and a graduate degree cost about $25,000.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\n===Bachelor of Liberal Arts===\nThe undergraduate curriculum is similar to the curriculum for [[Harvard College]] students; requirements include expository writing, quantitative reasoning, foreign language, moral reasoning, upper-level coursework, and an area of concentration.<ref name=\"solid\" />  The expository writing class is known as a \"gatekeeper course\" as it will typically \"determine whether [students] are prepared for the intensive and demanding curriculum.\"<ref name=\"open\" />\n\nOnce admitted as an ALB degree candidate, students must successfully complete 128 credits<ref name=\"extension.harvard_b\" /> (Harvard courses are typically 4 credits each) and maintain good academic standing to meet graduation requirements.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" />  Upon admission into the ALB program, students may petition to transfer up to a maximum of 64 credits from other accredited post-secondary institutions, but 64 credits must be completed at Harvard.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" /> Students select one of three \"areas of concentration\" which are humanities, science, and social sciences.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" />\n\nALB degree candidates are also required to complete a minimum of 16 on-campus-only credits at Harvard;<ref name=\"extension.harvard_e\" /> students must also complete a minimum of 12 writing-intensive credits and earn a minimum of 52 credits in courses that are taught by Harvard instructors.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_b\" /> In addition to a concentration, degree candidates have the option to pursue one of twenty \"fields of study\" (similar to majors).<ref name=\"fields\" /> In order to successfully complete a field of study, students must earn a B\u2013 or higher in 32 Harvard credits in one field, and maintain a B average in the field.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" /> Students may also complement their degree with up to two minors.<ref name=\"fields\" />\n\n====Undergraduate admissions====\nUndergraduate degree programs require pre-admission courses as well as a formal application process. <ref name=\"admit\" /> Students must also hold a \"high school diploma or its equivalent [which] must have been earned at least five years prior to enrolling in any ALB degree-applicable courses.\"<ref name=\"GZvkR\" /> Students applying for degree candidacy must complete three 4-credit liberal arts courses at Harvard (Extension School, Summer School, or the Faculty of Arts and Sciences) with at least a B grade in each, and maintain a minimum 3.0 cumulative [[grade point average|GPA]]. One of these three pre-admission courses must be EXPO E-25, the equivalent of Harvard College's mandatory and \"notoriously difficult\" expository writing course.<ref name=\"expos20\" /> To enroll in this course, students must either pass a placement test, which measures critical reading and writing skills, or enroll in EXPO E-15 (a course that acts as a precursor to EXPO E-25).<ref name=\"admit\" />  Students failing to earn at least a B in a class can retake it once. Those who meet all these criteria are then eligible to apply for admission into the school's undergraduate degree programs.\n\n===Master of Liberal Arts===\nThe [[Master of Liberal Arts]] in Extension Studies (ALM) includes 19 liberal arts fields of study and seven professional degree programs (Biotechnology, Information Technology, Journalism, Management, Mathematics for Teaching, Museum Studies, & Sustainability).<ref name=\"grad\" /> Except for Museum Studies (10 courses), all ALM candidates must complete 12 courses, with most requiring a thesis or capstone project crafted under the direction of an instructor or faculty member holding a teaching appointment in the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=\"thesis\" />\n\n====Graduate admissions====\nAdmission into a graduate degree program requires an accredited bachelor's degree (or foreign equivalent), passing the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills, the completion of two or three pre-admission courses with grades of B or higher, and a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0. One of the pre-admission courses must be the \"proseminar\" course for the intended area of study, which is akin to a traditional research methods course.<ref name=\"admit\" /> Certain disciplines have other specified pre-admission coursework, while some have specific coursework that is required before submitting a master's thesis proposal (biology and psychology students must take a specific graduate statistics course). Some programs require supplemental application materials; for instance, Creative Writing and Literature ALM candidates must submit original manuscripts.<ref name=\"apply\" /> Students who meet these criteria are then eligible to submit an application for admission into the graduate degree programs (ALM).\n\nA student who fails to earn a grade of B after twice enrolling in the proseminar course\u2014often considered a \"gatekeeper\" course\u2014will be denied admission indefinitely.<ref name=\"8G1Pv\" />\n\n==Student life==\nBeginning in the 1960s, the university began providing additional facilities for Extension students.  Study spaces, conferences rooms, library facilities, and a dining hall were set up in Lehman Hall for students in 1964.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=111}}  In addition, there was a television lounge where students could watch the WGBH programs.<ref name=\"banner1967\" />\n\nToday, admitted degree candidates are granted access to Harvard's athletic facilities, libraries, and career services, among other amenities. Students have \"nearly unfettered access to some of Harvard's most prized resources\u2014world-renowned libraries, a distinguished faculty, and an impressive body of speakers.\"<ref name=\"wells\" /> The top 10 percent of the undergraduate (ALB) graduating class in good standing is inducted into the Harvard Extension School's Phi Beta chapter (established 2002\u201303) of [[Alpha Sigma Lambda]], the national honor society for nontraditional students. Ordinarily, undergraduate students with GPAs of 3.8 or higher are eligible.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=208}} Degree candidates and alumni are also eligible to work at the [[Harvard Innovation Labs]].<ref name=\"Hi Lab\" />\n\nThe [[Harvard Extension Student Association]] (HESA) is the official acting student government for the Harvard Extension School and is the organization responsible for school's representation on the University's [[Harvard Graduate Council]]. All degree and diploma candidates in good standing at the school are voting members of HESA. Degree candidates are also eligible to be elected to HESA's Board of Directors. Established in 2001, HESA's mission is to build and maintain a sense of community among Extension students. In partnership with many other organizations on campus, HESA provides a variety of social activities, educational/networking events, and forums that enrich student life. HESA is in charge of managing officially sanctioned clubs within Harvard Extension School. Currently, there are two official clubs: Harvard Extension Student Environmental Club and Harvard Extension Student Management & Finance Club.<ref name=\"hesa\" />\n\n[[Drew Gilpin Faust|President Faust]] said that \"the Extension School is a critical part of the University\"<ref name=\"faustTalksHES\" /> and that \"students increasingly should come to see themselves as full-fledged members of not just an individual school but Harvard as a university.\"<ref name=\"24address\" />\n\n==Student demographics==\nThe class of 2019, the largest class to date, had 1,184 graduates.<ref name=\"2019grad\" /> The graduates had an average age of 37 and were nearly evenly split between the genders, with 54% being male.<ref name=\"2019grad\" /> 49 countries were represented in the graduating class.<ref name=\"2019grad\" />\n\nIn 2016, 96% of the students enrolled for professional enrichment.<ref name=\"serve\" /><ref name=\"young\" /> Half took a single course, and half were pursuing a degree.<ref name=\"serve\" /> The increase in online course offerings has fueled growth, and students from more than 150 countries are enrolled.<ref name=\"serve\" /> In 2017, the school educated more students than all of the rest of Harvard combined.<ref name=\"young\" />\n\nIn 2000, there were 14,216 students, with the youngest in their early teens and the oldest in their late 80s.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=199}}<ref name=\"open\" /> There is often a span of 60 years between the oldest and youngest students,{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=212}} and students as young as 11 years old have taken courses alongside those old enough to be their grandparents.<ref name=\"miller\" />  Of the students enrolled in 2000, 75% had a bachelor's degree and 20% had a graduate degree.  More than 1,700 were Harvard employees using the Tuition Assistance Program, and an estimated 10\u201315% were exclusively online students.  Of the 255 Certificate of Special Studies graduates that year, 163 were international students hailing from 39 countries.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=199}}\n\nIn the early 2000s, there were 208 students under the age of 18.{{sfn|Gates|2010}} Most attended local high schools, but a growing number of them were home-schooled.{{sfn|Gates|2010}} In 2018, a student from Kansas received his high school diploma and a bachelor's degree from the Extension School only a few days apart.<ref name=\"kansas\" />  The Extension School now requires that a high school diploma or its equivalent is earned at least five years prior to enrolling in any courses applicable to its undergraduate degree.<ref name=\"CDS-B\" /><ref name=\"kansas\" />\n\nHarvard Extension School accepts international students. To be admitted to courses or degrees, a student must prove proficiency in the English language. If English is not a student's native language then he or she must submit an official TOEFL or IELTS score with a minimum score of 100 for the TOEFL or a minimum score of 7.0 for the IELTS. International students must also meet the on-campus-only course requirements as outlined above. The Extension School does not issue [[I-20 (form)|I-20s]] for the [[F visa|F-1 visa]] but the Summer School does.<ref name=\"international\" />  In 2007\u201308, more than 2,500 international students and nearly 2,000 Harvard University employees were enrolled in classes.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=213}}  In 2013, students came from 118 countries and 46 states.<ref name=\"open\" />\n\n==Alumni==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width: 40%\"\n|-\n!

In 1997, Mary Fasano became the oldest undergraduate degree recipient,{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=153}} while in 1983, Thomas Small became the oldest master's degree recipient.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=138}} Both were in their 90th year. The youngest degree earner in Harvard history was 18-year-old Amit Chatterjee who earned an ALB in 2002.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=211}}\n\nOne of Small's classmates, Christopher Lohse, was selected to give the graduate [[Commencement speech|commencement address]].  His speech, \"The 10,000 Ghosts of Harvard,\" was a play on both the [[Ten Thousand Men of Harvard|university's fight song]] and the fact that classes are taught after dark.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=138}}  In 1989, another ALM graduate gave the commencement address. [[Joseph R. Paolino Jr.]] began his studies as a Providence city councilor, and at the time of his speech, he was the Mayor of Providence. He went on to become [[United States Ambassador to Malta|Ambassador to Malta]].<ref name=\"62bOR\" />\n\nIn 1936, one person had taken courses for 26 consecutive years.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=55}} Two others that year had been students for 24 years.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=55}}\n\n==Coat of arms==\n{{main|Heraldry of Harvard University}}\nThe coat of arms for the Extension School was approved in 1983. At the top of the shield the three books spelling out ''Veritas'' (Latin for \"truth\") represent graduate education, as the same device is found on the arms of the other graduate schools.  Instead of a straight line separating it from the rest of the shield, as is found in the other schools, a line with six arcs pointing up was used instead.  A silver chevron was used to represent undergraduate education, a device used in the shield of Harvard College in the 17th to 19th centuries.  Two bushels of wheat are included to represent John Lowell's stipulation that courses should not cost more than two bushels of wheat.  A golden lamp is included to represent both learning and the fact that some classes are taught at night.{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=137}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Princeton\">{{cite web| url = http://www.princeton.edu/hpa/post-bac-programs/career-changer/| title = Career Change Programs| publisher = The Trustees of [[Princeton University]]| accessdate = December 22, 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"fodors\">{{cite book| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307929235| url-access = registration| quote = harvard extension.| title = Fodor's Boston| first1 = Debbie | last1 = Harmsen| first2 = Maria Teresa | last2 = Hart| publisher = Fodors Travel Pub.| year = 2012| isbn = 9780307929235}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"fortune\">{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=qb50AQAAQBAJ&dq=%22harvard+extension%22| title = Fortune Tellers: The Story of America's First Economic Forecasters| first = Walter | last = Friedman| publisher = Princeton University Press| date = November 28, 2013| isbn = 9781400849864}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"felder\">{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=_nVsqM5NxEYC&dq=%22harvard+extension%22| title = Felder's Comprehensive, 2005 Edition: The Annual Desk Reference and Product Thesaurus for Architects, Contractors, Engineers, and Interior Designers| first = Nick | last = Felder| date = July 14, 2005| accessdate = December 22, 2014| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press| isbn = 9781568984742}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"2019grad\">{{cite web| url = https://www.extension.harvard.edu/2019-harvard-extension-commencement| title = Harvard Extension Commencement 2019| publisher = Harvard Extension School| accessdate = December 16, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"CDS-B\">{{cite web|url=https://www.extension.harvard.edu/registration-admissions/degree-program-admissions/undergraduate-degree-program-admissions|title=Undergraduate Degree Program Admissions|publisher=Harvard Extension School}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"2016grad\">{{cite web | url = http://www.extension.harvard.edu/inside-extension/harvard-extension-school-class-2016-numbers | title = Harvard Extension School Class of 2016 by the Numbers | type = Infographic | publisher = President and Fellows of Harvard College | accessdate = May 24, 2016 | date = 2016-05-23}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"363rd\">{{cite web | url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/05/7334-degrees-certificates-awarded-at-harvards-363rd-commencement | title = 7,334 degrees, certificates awarded at Harvard's 363rd Commencement | date = May 29, 2014 | accessdate = December 11, 2014 | publisher = Harvard Gazette}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"admit\">{{cite web | url = https://www.extension.harvard.edu/tuition-enrollment/degree-program-admission | title = Degree Program Admission | publisher = Harvard Extension School | accessdate = November 18, 2015 | date = 2015-04-08}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Albion\">{{cite news | title=Harvard Univ.

Under the [[Faculty of Arts and Sciences]], individual courses among the school's [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] and professional offerings, a number of which have [[Harvard College]] equivalents, are open-enrollment. However, the Extension School also offers [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate degrees]], [[Graduate school|graduate degrees]], and [[Academic certificate|certificates]] in more than 60 fields of study, provided that a qualifying test is passed, satisfactory grades are obtained in prior Harvard coursework, and a formal application is accepted. Degree candidates and alumni enjoy access to Harvard's many amenities and opportunities.\n\nThe school offers on-campus, online, and hybrid courses. It also offers a pre-medical program for students needing specific coursework to apply to medical school. The school is primarily intended for nontraditional adult learners.\n\nSince its establishment in 1910, an estimated 500,000 students have taken courses at the Extension School. Of these, 0.18% earned a degree.{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=214}}\n\n==History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left:1em\"\n|-\n! Year<ref name=\"gates\" /> !!

Lawrence Lowell]], the Harvard Extension School grew out of the [[Lowell Institute]], which was created according to the terms of a bequest by John Lowell, Jr.  It was designed to serve the educational interests and needs of the greater [[Boston]] community,{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=220}} particularly those \"who had the ability and desire to attend college, but also had other obligations that kept them from traditional schools.\"<ref name=\"sampler\" />  It has since extended its academic resources to the public, locally, nationally, and internationally.\n\nDuring the 1920s [[professor]]s from [[Boston University]] and [[Harvard University]] traveled to teach courses offsite.<ref name=\"Yonkers\" /> While they were primarily aimed at teachers, courses were offered wherever 40 or more students expressed an interest.<ref name=\"Yonkers\" />  Professors traveled on a weekly basis to places around New England and as far away as [[Yonkers, New York]],<ref name=\"Yonkers\" /> some 200 miles away.\n\nIn the early years courses were run by a commission composed of several Boston area schools, though it was largely a Harvard-run program.<ref name=\"wheat\" />{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=54}}{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=104}}  In 1938 there were 28 professors from Commission faculties, including 11 full professors.<ref name=\"courses\" />  Early faculty included [[Charles Townsend Copeland]], [[William Yandell Elliot]], [[William L. Langer]], [[Oscar Handlin]], [[Perry Miller]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], and [[Frank M. Carpenter]].{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=52}} In 1953 there was a similar number of professors.<ref name=\"wheat\" />\n\nIn his will, John Lowell asked his successors to set up courses \"more erudite and particular corresponding to the age and wants of the age.\"<ref name=\"wheat\" />  By the 50th anniversary of the University Extension in 1960, more than 1,400 courses had been offered and there had been more than 85,000 enrollments.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=81}} Lowell's bequest limited the cost of tuition to no more than two bushels of wheat. During the [[Great Depression]] this amounted to roughly $5 per semester course.{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=50}}\n\nSeveral years after retiring, President Lowell wrote that the Extension courses \"have given a service to the public&nbsp;... which seems to me of the utmost importance.\"{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=225}}  In 2013, more than 100 years after its founding, the Extension School's classes were described as \"surprisingly affordable\"<ref name=\"fodors\" /> and the school itself was said to be a \"thriving institution.\"<ref name=\"fortune\" />\n\n===Degree development===\nThe Extension School currently offers two degrees (and has offered these degrees since 1979): the [[Bachelor of Liberal Arts]] in Extension Studies (ALB) and the [[Master of Liberal Arts]] in Extension Studies (ALM).<ref name=\"century\" />  From 1911 to 1933, the school offered an Associate in Arts, and from 1933 to 1960, it offered an Adjunct in Arts.<ref name=\"century\" />  Both were considered the [[History of Harvard Extension School#Extension grows|equivalent of a bachelor's degree]].<ref name=\"century\" /> From 1971 to 2014, the school offered an Associate of Arts in Extension Studies (AA), the equivalent of a two-year degree.<ref name=\"century\" />\n\nA proposal before the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 2009 and 2010 to rename the school and the degrees offered was not accepted.<ref name=\"sinjin\" /><ref name=\"rename\" />  A committee led by Professor of Computer Science [[Harry R. Lewis]] proposed renaming the school the \"Harvard School of Continuing and Professional Studies\" and dropping the words \"in Extension Studies\" from degrees so that the school would offer Bachelor of Liberal Arts, Master of Liberal Arts, and Master of Professional Studies degrees. Some faculty objected, saying that those degrees were too similar to degrees already offered by the College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.<ref name=\"rename\" />\n\nIn 2016, a student group calling itself the Harvard Extension Degree Change Initiative rallied in front of [[University Hall (Harvard University)|University Hall]] to call for removing \u201cExtension Studies\u201d from the degree name and adding a student's field of study instead.<ref name=\"extendingDegree\" /> ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' editorialized in favor, urging Harvard to \"consider changing the title of Extension School degrees to include the field of study rather than the ambiguous 'Extension Studies.'\"<ref name=\"extendingDegree\" /> While the school retains \"Extension Studies\" in official degree titles, transcripts reflect students' area of academic concentration.\n\nIn 2019, Dean [[Huntington D.

For these courses, office hours and other student support are typically offered using live or asynchronous software. Additionally, Extension students are offered the option to attend class lectures for these dual-listed courses on campus. Extension degree candidates who meet required criteria may also apply for \"Special Student status\" to enroll for up to two courses in Harvard College, Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, or another Harvard Graduate School.<ref name=\"Tv75F\" /> The majority of instructors at the school, 52%, are Harvard affiliates; 48% are faculty from other schools and industry professionals.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\nStudents may enroll full or part-time, and classes may be taken on campus, via distance-learning, or both. In order to earn an academic degree, students must complete a minimum number of on-campus-only credits at Harvard.{{efn|n.b. These requirements vary for each degree, from 4 classes in residency for the ALB or the ALM/Biology, two semesters residency requirement for the general ALM, and up to 50% residency requirement for the ALM/Management. It is therefore not possible to receive an academic degree solely through distance learning.}}\n\nNon-degree students have access to the [[Harvard Library]], including electronic resources and select computer facilities.<ref name=\"resources\" /> Those registered for a course at the Extension School may also access writing tutorials at the Writing Center as well as assistance with math and related courses at the Math Question Center.<ref name=\"resources\" /><ref name=\"KrErQ\" /><ref name=\"Hq1IU\" /> Career services and academic advising are offered through the school's Career and Academic Resource Center.<ref name=\"resources\" /><ref name=\"DW0rC\" />\n\n===Accreditation and partnerships===\nHarvard Extension School is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] as one of the twelve degree-granting schools of [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"young\" />\n\nThe Extension School and [[Harvard Business School]] have together created the HBX Credential of Readiness (CORe) program.<ref name=\"sean\" /><ref name=\"hbx\" /> Having begun in 2014, this program allows undergraduate students at the Extension School to take courses with Business School professors for credit.<ref name=\"sean\" /><ref name=\"hbx\" />\n\nThe graduate program in Museum Studies has developed a partnership with the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref name=\"smithsonian\" />  The new courses include two active learning weekends in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"smithsonian\" />  The Extension School is also looking into partnerships with the [[Harvard School of Public Health|School of Public Health]], the [[Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences|School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]], and the [[Harvard Medical School|Medical School]].<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\n===Pre-medical program===\nA [[pre-med]] program was established at the Extension School in 1980.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=129}} Students who successfully complete the pre-medical program are eligible for sponsorship through the program and a committee letter of support in their applications to medical school.<ref name=\"Princeton\" /><ref name=\"jIJ1T\" />\n\n===Distance education===\n\n====History====\nHarvard Extension was a pioneer in [[distance education]].<ref name=\"young\" /> Beginning on December 5, 1949, courses were offered on the [[Lowell Institute|Lowell Institute's]] new radio station. New Englanders could go to college six nights a week at 7:30 in their living rooms simply by tuning into courses on psychology, world history, and economics.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=70}} The first course on radio was by Peter A. Bertocci of Boston University. For 30 years he taught Extension courses, with never fewer than 100 students. He often taught over 300 students per course and once had over 400. Over the years Bertocci taught at least 7,000 Extension students, a record for the school.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=71}}\n\nThe radio courses proved to be so successful that when the television station [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] went on the air in October 1951 they began broadcasting an Extension class every weekday at 3:30 and 7:30.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=72}} The first course, offered by [[Robert G. Albion]], was on European Imperialism on Monday and Thursday evenings.<ref name=\"Albion\" /> In the late 1960s, three of the televised courses were offered in the [[Deer Island Prison]].{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=102}} Students who watched the courses on television could attend six \"conferences\" and take a mid-term and a final exam at Harvard in order to gain credit for the class.<ref name=\"Albion\" />\n\n====Contemporary====\n{{As of|2014}}, distance-learning courses at Harvard Extension School are offered in two formats: asynchronous video courses (lectures are recorded and uploaded within 24 hours of on-campus class meetings); and live web-conference courses (courses are streamed live, and typically allow for synchronous participation from students via a secondary online platform).\n\nThe first online courses were offered in 1997.<ref name=\"serve\" />  Between 2013 and 2016, the number of online classes grew from 200 to more than 450.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\n===Awards and honors===\nThe Dean's Prize for Outstanding Master of Liberal Arts thesis is awarded during [[Graduation|commencement ceremonies]], and includes a medal, a certificate, and a monetary award. It is awarded to a student whose graduate thesis \"embodies the highest level of imaginative scholarship.\"<ref name=\"outstanding\" /> In addition to the Dean's Prize for Outstanding ALM Thesis, there are several other academic prizes:<ref name=\"awards\" /><ref name=\"N841C\" />\n\n*The Academy of American Poets is awarded to an ALB candidate or an undergraduate student at the college for the best poem or group of poems.\n*The Santo J. Aurelio Prize is awarded to an ALB degree recipient aged 50 or older; this prize acknowledges distinguished and unique records of academic achievement and character.\n*The [[Derek Bok Public Service Prizes]] are awards presented at Commencement. They consist of a cash prize along with a citation and a medal given to graduating Extension School students. The award recognizes creative initiatives in community service or long-standing records of civic achievement.<ref name=\"honors\" />\n*The Commencement Speaker Prize is awarded to either an ALB or ALM graduate who delivers the student Commencement speech at the Extension School diploma awarding ceremony.\n*The Annamae and Allan R. Crite Prize is awarded to ALM (liberal arts field) or ALB graduates who concentrate in visual arts or other artistic fields on the basis of academic achievement and dedication to learning and the arts.\n*The Klein Family History Prize recognizes the thesis in the field of history that represents superior achievement in historical scholarship. \n*The Harold Langlois Award recognizes an ALM management or finance graduate who has demonstrated exceptional academic accomplishment and promise as a manager. Based upon highest cumulative GPA.\n*The Patrick Lee Award in Drama is an annual award given to the student who shows the best promise in the field of dramatic arts.\n*The Reginald H. Phelps Prize, named for the former dean, is awarded annually on the basis of \"academic achievement and character\" to outstanding graduating students receiving bachelor's degrees.\n*The John Osborne Sargent Prize for a Latin Translation is offered for the best metrical translation [students may choose meter] of a lyric poem of Horace, to be selected each year by the Department of the Classics. In addition to ALB candidates, it is also open to undergraduates at the College and visiting undergraduates under the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\n*The Thomas Small Prize is named for a Lithuanian immigrant who, at the age of 89, became the oldest earned graduate degree recipient in the history of Harvard University. Two prizes are awarded annually on the basis \"academic achievement and character\" to two outstanding Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies degree recipients.\n* The Judith Wood Memorial Prizes are awarded during Commencement Week to Harvard Extension School students who, while compiling honors academic records at the school, also contended with disabilities of a serious nature. It was established in honor of a blind Extension Student student who had cystic fibrosis and diabetes to recognize students who must travel a singularly difficult path to degree or certificate completion. \n*The Katie Y.F. Yang Prize is awarded annually to the international ALM management or finance graduate with the most outstanding academic record.\n\n==Degree programs==\nTo be eligible to apply to the Extension School's degree programs, students must \"earn [their] way in\" by passing the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills as well as completing two or three designated admission classes with a B or better.<ref name=\"serve\" /> In 2016, Dean [[Huntington D. Lambert]] said that 32% of those who want to pursue an undergraduate degree (ALB) earn the grades necessary for admission, making admissions \"very selective.\"<ref name=\"serve\" />\nIf the admission requirements are met, acceptance is not guaranteed but very likely. About 85% of those admitted successfully earn their degree (ALB).<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\nIt has been estimated that acceptance into the graduate programs (ALM), using the number of accepted students and the number of students enrolled in admission courses, is 15-20%. Thus, based on traditional metrics, admission into the graduate programs is highly selective.\n\nALB students may graduate ''cum laude'', but ''magna''- and ''summa''- ''cum laude'' are not offered. Extension students may earn the Dean's List Academic Achievement Award upon graduation based on a high GPA (at least 3.5 for ALB, 3.8 for ALM).<ref name=\"RFSwK\" /> Many courses are offered online, but a degree cannot be earned entirely online as students are required to take classes on campus before earning their degree.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\nStudents who wish to earn degrees must be formally admitted to the Extension School by the Admissions Committee.<ref name=\"open\" />  Admitted degree candidates are granted full privileges to Harvard's libraries, facilities, student resources, as well as access to Harvard's museums and academic workshops. In 2016, an undergraduate degree cost around $40,000, and a graduate degree cost about $25,000.<ref name=\"serve\" />\n\n===Bachelor of Liberal Arts===\nThe undergraduate curriculum is similar to the curriculum for [[Harvard College]] students; requirements include expository writing, quantitative reasoning, foreign language, moral reasoning, upper-level coursework, and an area of concentration.<ref name=\"solid\" />  The expository writing class is known as a \"gatekeeper course\" as it will typically \"determine whether [students] are prepared for the intensive and demanding curriculum.\"<ref name=\"open\" />\n\nOnce admitted as an ALB degree candidate, students must successfully complete 128 credits<ref name=\"extension.harvard_b\" /> (Harvard courses are typically 4 credits each) and maintain good academic standing to meet graduation requirements.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" />  Upon admission into the ALB program, students may petition to transfer up to a maximum of 64 credits from other accredited post-secondary institutions, but 64 credits must be completed at Harvard.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" /> Students select one of three \"areas of concentration\" which are humanities, science, and social sciences.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" />\n\nALB degree candidates are also required to complete a minimum of 16 on-campus-only credits at Harvard;<ref name=\"extension.harvard_e\" /> students must also complete a minimum of 12 writing-intensive credits and earn a minimum of 52 credits in courses that are taught by Harvard instructors.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_b\" /> In addition to a concentration, degree candidates have the option to pursue one of twenty \"fields of study\" (similar to majors).<ref name=\"fields\" /> In order to successfully complete a field of study, students must earn a B\u2013 or higher in 32 Harvard credits in one field, and maintain a B average in the field.<ref name=\"extension.harvard_a\" /> Students may also complement their degree with up to two minors.<ref name=\"fields\" />\n\n====Undergraduate admissions====\nUndergraduate degree programs require pre-admission courses as well as a formal application process. <ref name=\"admit\" /> Students must also hold a \"high school diploma or its equivalent [which] must have been earned at least five years prior to enrolling in any ALB degree-applicable courses.\"<ref name=\"GZvkR\" /> Students applying for degree candidacy must complete three 4-credit liberal arts courses at Harvard (Extension School, Summer School, or the Faculty of Arts and Sciences) with at least a B grade in each, and maintain a minimum 3.0 cumulative [[grade point average|GPA]]. One of these three pre-admission courses must be EXPO E-25, the equivalent of Harvard College's mandatory and \"notoriously difficult\" expository writing course.<ref name=\"expos20\" /> To enroll in this course, students must either pass a placement test, which measures critical reading and writing skills, or enroll in EXPO E-15 (a course that acts as a precursor to EXPO E-25).<ref name=\"admit\" />  Students failing to earn at least a B in a class can retake it once. Those who meet all these criteria are then eligible to apply for admission into the school's undergraduate degree programs.\n\n===Master of Liberal Arts===\nThe [[Master of Liberal Arts]] in Extension Studies (ALM) includes 19 liberal arts fields of study and seven professional degree programs (Biotechnology, Information Technology, Journalism, Management, Mathematics for Teaching, Museum Studies, & Sustainability).<ref name=\"grad\" /> Except for Museum Studies (10 courses), all ALM candidates must complete 12 courses, with most requiring a thesis or capstone project crafted under the direction of an instructor or faculty member holding a teaching appointment in the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=\"thesis\" />\n\n====Graduate admissions====\nAdmission into a graduate degree program requires an accredited bachelor's degree (or foreign equivalent), passing the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills, the completion of two or three pre-admission courses with grades of B or higher, and a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0. One of the pre-admission courses must be the \"proseminar\" course for the intended area of study, which is akin to a traditional research methods course.<ref name=\"admit\" /> Certain disciplines have other specified pre-admission coursework, while some have specific coursework that is required before submitting a master's thesis proposal (biology and psychology students must take a specific graduate statistics course). Some programs require supplemental application materials; for instance, Creative Writing and Literature ALM candidates must submit original manuscripts.<ref name=\"apply\" /> Students who meet these criteria are then eligible to submit an application for admission into the graduate degree programs (ALM).\n\nA student who fails to earn a grade of B after twice enrolling in the proseminar course\u2014often considered a \"gatekeeper\" course\u2014will be denied admission indefinitely.<ref name=\"8G1Pv\" />\n\n==Student life==\nBeginning in the 1960s, the university began providing additional facilities for Extension students.  Study spaces, conferences rooms, library facilities, and a dining hall were set up in Lehman Hall for students in 1964.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=111}}  In addition, there was a television lounge where students could watch the WGBH programs.<ref name=\"banner1967\" />\n\nToday, admitted degree candidates are granted access to Harvard's athletic facilities, libraries, and career services, among other amenities. Students have \"nearly unfettered access to some of Harvard's most prized resources\u2014world-renowned libraries, a distinguished faculty, and an impressive body of speakers.\"<ref name=\"wells\" /> The top 10 percent of the undergraduate (ALB) graduating class in good standing is inducted into the Harvard Extension School's Phi Beta chapter (established 2002\u201303) of [[Alpha Sigma Lambda]], the national honor society for nontraditional students. Ordinarily, undergraduate students with GPAs of 3.8 or higher are eligible.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=208}} Degree candidates and alumni are also eligible to work at the [[Harvard Innovation Labs]].<ref name=\"Hi Lab\" />\n\nThe [[Harvard Extension Student Association]] (HESA) is the official acting student government for the Harvard Extension School and is the organization responsible for school's representation on the University's [[Harvard Graduate Council]]. All degree and diploma candidates in good standing at the school are voting members of HESA. Degree candidates are also eligible to be elected to HESA's Board of Directors. Established in 2001, HESA's mission is to build and maintain a sense of community among Extension students. In partnership with many other organizations on campus, HESA provides a variety of social activities, educational/networking events, and forums that enrich student life. HESA is in charge of managing officially sanctioned clubs within Harvard Extension School. Currently, there are two official clubs: Harvard Extension Student Environmental Club and Harvard Extension Student Management & Finance Club.<ref name=\"hesa\" />\n\n[[Drew Gilpin Faust|President Faust]] said that \"the Extension School is a critical part of the University\"<ref name=\"faustTalksHES\" /> and that \"students increasingly should come to see themselves as full-fledged members of not just an individual school but Harvard as a university.\"<ref name=\"24address\" />\n\n==Student demographics==\nThe class of 2019, the largest class to date, had 1,184 graduates.<ref name=\"2019grad\" /> The graduates had an average age of 37 and were nearly evenly split between the genders, with 54% being male.<ref name=\"2019grad\" /> 49 countries were represented in the graduating class.<ref name=\"2019grad\" />\n\nIn 2016, 96% of the students enrolled for professional enrichment.<ref name=\"serve\" /><ref name=\"young\" /> Half took a single course, and half were pursuing a degree.<ref name=\"serve\" /> The increase in online course offerings has fueled growth, and students from more than 150 countries are enrolled.<ref name=\"serve\" /> In 2017, the school educated more students than all of the rest of Harvard combined.<ref name=\"young\" />\n\nIn 2000, there were 14,216 students, with the youngest in their early teens and the oldest in their late 80s.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=199}}<ref name=\"open\" /> There is often a span of 60 years between the oldest and youngest students,{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=212}} and students as young as 11 years old have taken courses alongside those old enough to be their grandparents.<ref name=\"miller\" />  Of the students enrolled in 2000, 75% had a bachelor's degree and 20% had a graduate degree.  More than 1,700 were Harvard employees using the Tuition Assistance Program, and an estimated 10\u201315% were exclusively online students.  Of the 255 Certificate of Special Studies graduates that year, 163 were international students hailing from 39 countries.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=199}}\n\nIn the early 2000s, there were 208 students under the age of 18.{{sfn|Gates|2010}} Most attended local high schools, but a growing number of them were home-schooled.{{sfn|Gates|2010}} In 2018, a student from Kansas received his high school diploma and a bachelor's degree from the Extension School only a few days apart.<ref name=\"kansas\" />  The Extension School now requires that a high school diploma or its equivalent is earned at least five years prior to enrolling in any courses applicable to its undergraduate degree.<ref name=\"CDS-B\" /><ref name=\"kansas\" />\n\nHarvard Extension School accepts international students. To be admitted to courses or degrees, a student must prove proficiency in the English language. If English is not a student's native language then he or she must submit an official TOEFL or IELTS score with a minimum score of 100 for the TOEFL or a minimum score of 7.0 for the IELTS. International students must also meet the on-campus-only course requirements as outlined above.

His speech, \"The 10,000 Ghosts of Harvard,\" was a play on both the [[Ten Thousand Men of Harvard|university's fight song]] and the fact that classes are taught after dark.{{sfn|Shinagle|2010|p=138}}  In 1989, another ALM graduate gave the commencement address. [[Joseph R. Paolino Jr.]] began his studies as a Providence city councilor, and at the time of his speech, he was the Mayor of Providence.

At the top of the shield the three books spelling out ''Veritas'' (Latin for \"truth\") represent graduate education, as the same device is found on the arms of the other graduate schools.  Instead of a straight line separating it from the rest of the shield, as is found in the other schools, a line with six arcs pointing up was used instead.  A silver chevron was used to represent undergraduate education, a device used in the shield of Harvard College in the 17th to 19th centuries.  Two bushels of wheat are included to represent John Lowell's stipulation that courses should not cost more than two bushels of wheat.  A golden lamp is included to represent both learning and the fact that some classes are taught at night.{{sfn|Shinagel|2010|p=137}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Princeton\">{{cite web| url = http://www.princeton.edu/hpa/post-bac-programs/career-changer/| title = Career Change Programs| publisher = The Trustees of [[Princeton University]]| accessdate = December 22, 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"fodors\">{{cite book| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307929235| url-access = registration| quote = harvard extension.| title = Fodor's Boston| first1 = Debbie | last1 = Harmsen| first2 = Maria Teresa | last2 = Hart| publisher = Fodors Travel Pub.| year = 2012| isbn = 9780307929235}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"fortune\">{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=qb50AQAAQBAJ&dq=%22harvard+extension%22| title = Fortune Tellers: The Story of America's First Economic Forecasters| first = Walter | last = Friedman| publisher = Princeton University Press| date = November 28, 2013| isbn = 9781400849864}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"felder\">{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=_nVsqM5NxEYC&dq=%22harvard+extension%22| title = Felder's Comprehensive, 2005 Edition: The Annual Desk Reference and Product Thesaurus for Architects, Contractors, Engineers, and Interior Designers| first = Nick | last = Felder| date = July 14, 2005| accessdate = December 22, 2014| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press| isbn = 9781568984742}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"2019grad\">{{cite web| url = https://www.extension.harvard.edu/2019-harvard-extension-commencement| title = Harvard Extension Commencement 2019| publisher = Harvard Extension School| accessdate = December 16, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"CDS-B\">{{cite web|url=https://www.extension.harvard.edu/registration-admissions/degree-program-admissions/undergraduate-degree-program-admissions|title=Undergraduate Degree Program Admissions|publisher=Harvard Extension School}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"2016grad\">{{cite web | url = http://www.extension.harvard.edu/inside-extension/harvard-extension-school-class-2016-numbers | title = Harvard Extension School Class of 2016 by the Numbers | type = Infographic | publisher = President and Fellows of Harvard College | accessdate = May 24, 2016 | date = 2016-05-23}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"363rd\">{{cite web | url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/05/7334-degrees-certificates-awarded-at-harvards-363rd-commencement | title = 7,334 degrees, certificates awarded at Harvard's 363rd Commencement | date = May 29, 2014 | accessdate = December 11, 2014 | publisher = Harvard Gazette}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"admit\">{{cite web | url = https://www.extension.harvard.edu/tuition-enrollment/degree-program-admission | title = Degree Program Admission | publisher = Harvard Extension School | accessdate = November 18, 2015 | date = 2015-04-08}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Albion\">{{cite news | title=Harvard Univ.
