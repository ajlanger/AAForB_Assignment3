They were established by governor [[Philip Gidley King]] by drawing men from the [[New South Wales Corps]], the British garrison in the colony.  The provided an escort to the governor and carried his dispatches to outposts across the colony.  From 1802 the men of the unit were drawn from convicts pardoned by King, after a dispute between the governor and the commander of the New South Wales Corps.  Men from the unit distinguished themselves by their conduct during operations to recapture escaped convicts in 1803 and during the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] of 1804.\n\nAfter King was succeeded by [[William Bligh]] in 1806 the body guard reverted to being drawn from the New South Wales Corps.  They seem to have been absent during the [[Rum Rebellion|Corps' 1808 mutiny against Bligh]] and by one report supported it.  The unit was ordered to disband by the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Earl of Liverpool]] in 1811/12 but granted a reprieve by Liverpool's successor [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Earl Bathurst]].  [[F. J. Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Viscount Goderich]] ordered disbandment again in 1832 and Governor [[Richard Bourke]] transformed the unit into the Mounted Orderlies in 1834.  These were absorbed into the [[New South Wales Mounted Police]] in 1836 and continued as a separate component until at least 1860.\n\n== Formation ==\n[[File:Philip Gidley King - Project Gutenberg eText 12992.jpg|thumb|right|Governor King]]\nThe body guard were raised in the British [[Colony of New South Wales]] in late 1800, at the initiative of Governor [[Philip Gidley King]].  An order was sent from King to Lieutenant-Colonel [[William Paterson (explorer)|William Paterson]] of the [[New South Wales Corps]] on 26 December 1800, requiring the corps to provide a [[non-commissioned officer]] and six privates to act as a body guard to King.  King intended to utilise the men as messengers to carry dispatches and so specified that the men be capable of riding a horse.  Six men and a corporal were found, some of whom had formerly served in cavalry regiments, and were serving the role by early 1801.  King provided horses and cavalry equipment from colony government funds and authorised a one shilling per day pay rise to the corporal and six-pence to the privates.  The unit has been described as \"one of the lesser known of the military organisations in the early history of the Colony of New South Wales\".  It's obscurity may derive from its informal origins; being raised by the governor without authority from Whitehall and never authorised by the [[War Office]] the men remained formally members of their original units.<ref name=sargent3>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=3}}</ref>  It has been be described as the first full-time military unit raised in Australia.<ref name=sargent12/>\n\nThe body guard carried the governor's dispatches needed to be carried to far-flung garrison outposts across the colony and were particularly busy in the early years due to unrest among newly arrived Irish convicts.  Many of these men were Republican revolutionaries, members of the [[Society of United Irishmen]] sentenced to transportation following capture after the 21 June 1798 [[Battle of Vinegar Hill]].<ref name=sargent3/>  However by 1 March 1802 the unit had dwindled to just the corporal and four privates.<ref name=sargent3/>  \n\n== Use of pardoned convicts ==\n[[File:John Macarthur.jpg|thumb|John Macarthur]]\nFrom 12 October 1802 the men of the body guard ceased to be drawn from the New South Wales Corps, possibly as a result of a disagreement between King and Paterson.  King instead drew members from prisoners in good standing, whom he pardoned, a move that upset Paterson.<ref name=sargent4/>  King clashed frequently with the members of the New South Wales Corps over their monopoly on the trade in rum and misuse of convict labour.<ref name=clune80>{{Harvnb|Clune|2009|p=80}}</ref>  In 1801 King prevented the landing of {{convert|58000|impgal|litres}} of alcohol; a series of disputes culminated in the wounding of Paterson in a duel with one of his captains heavily involved in the rum trade, [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]].<ref name=clune77>{{Harvnb|Clune|2009|p=77}}</ref>  King later sent Macarthur to England to face trial, but the advocate-general refused to hear the case and he was freed.<ref name=steven>{{Harvnb|Steven|1967|}}</ref>  King's employment of ex-convicts in the body guard was known about at the colonial office in London and appears to have received tacit sanction, despite the irregularity of such an arrangement.

Piper refused to make use of the men and ordered them to remain at Government House in Sydney.  This angered King who complained to Major [[George Johnston (British Marines officer)|George Johnston]], who commanded the corps while Paterson was ill.   Johnston replied that the body guard could not be considered soldiers as they were not subject to the Articles of War and also questioned if they were reliable enough to have earned their pardons.  King's reply stated that the men were as respectable as those in the New South Wales Corps, at least seventy of whom were also former convicts.  The disagreement ended with the replacement of Piper as commandant at Parramatta by Captain [[Edward Abbott (jurist)|Edward Abbott]]; the convicts were recaptured and two were executed.  Major Johnston himself later made use of the body guard as part and commented favourably upon their conduct.<ref name=sargent4>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=4}}</ref>\n\nDespite rumours of impending revolt among the Irish convicts the remainder of 1803 was quiet for the body guard.<ref name=sargent5>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=5}}</ref>  In November King pardoned George Bridges Bellasis, a former lieutenant in an [[East India Company]] artillery unit who had been transported for killing a fellow officer in a duel.  King granted Bellasis the rank of a lieutenant of artillery and placed him in command of the body guard.<ref name=sargent4/>\n\n== Castle Hill convict rebellion==\n[[File:Battle of VinegarHill.jpg|thumb|A contemporary depiction of the open stages of the Second Battle of Vinegar Hill.

One trooper of the body guard was sent to carry orders to Major Johnston who was at his house in [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]].  Johnston was to assemble forces to intercept the convicts.<ref name=sargent5/>  \n\nThe convicts retreated ahead of Johnston's force, through [[Toongabbie]] but were caught at [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] before they could reach [[City of Hawkesbury|Hawkesbury]].  Johnston, intending to delay the convicts whilst he assembled his forces, sent the body guard's Trooper Anlezark to parley with them.  The convicts removed Anlezark's pistol flints, rendering his weapons useless, but allowed him to return unharmed.  Johnston then decided to speak with the convict leaders in person, accompanied by Anlezark.  The convicts refused to surrender and began forming up on a nearby hill (later nicknamed Vinegar Hill).  Johnston requested another meeting with the convicts at which he and Anlezark drew their pistols and seized two of the convict leaders.<ref name=sargent5/>   Men of the New South Wales Corps then advanced on the hill and after a short fight defeated the convicts and ended the rebellion.<ref name=sargent6>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=6}}</ref>  \n\nThe battle, which became known as the Second Battle of Vinegar Hill, is depicted in a contemporary painting now in the collection of the [[National Library of Australia]].  The painting depicts Anlezark (erroneously shown as a corporal) drawing his pistol and ordering a rebel leader: \"[[Croppy]] lay down\".<ref name=sargent6/>  Anlezark, a convicted burglar and 14-year British Army cavalry veteran, was promoted to corporal in the body guard in May 1804, replacing the existing NCO who was discharged for \"gross abuse to a superintendent\".  The body guard's actions in quelling the rebellion and a favourable report from Johnston led King to propose increasing the troop to 30 men.  It seems this was never implemented, such an action required the approval of the British colonial secretary, which was not forthcoming.<ref name=sargent7/>\n\n== Bligh and the Rum Rebellion ==\n[[File:Arrest of Govenor Bligh.jpg|thumb|ontemporary propoganda depicting Bligh's arrest]]\nKing was succeeded as governor by [[William Bligh]] in August 1806.  Bligh immediately set about reforming the colony, banning the use of rum as a de facto currency.  However this action, together with his bad temper and bluff manner made him many enemies, including Macarthur who had since returned to New South Wales.<ref name=binney15>{{Harvnb|Binney|2005|p=15}}</ref>  Bligh arrested Macarthur in early January 1808 for violating the alcohol-related import restrictions.  Johnston, who now commanded the New South Wales Corps in Sydney, marched on government house and arrested Bligh in an act known as the [[Rum Rebellion]].<ref name=brit>{{cite web |title=Rum Rebellion |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Rum-Rebellion |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=31 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>  \n\nIt is unclear where the men of the body guard were during Bligh's arrest but they had since reverted to being provided from men of the New South Wales Corps and, given their divided loyalties, probably chose to absent themselves on the day of the rebellion.  However Bligh's provost marshal William Gore, later recalled being visited by members of the body guard during his imprisonment and alleged that Macarthur, who set himself up as colonial secretary, was attended by two members of the unit.<ref name=sargent7>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=7}}</ref>\n\n== Later service ==\n[[File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg|thumb|Governor Macquarie]]\n[[Lachlan Macquarie]] was dispatched by the British government to assume the office of governor and restore order arriving in December 1809.<ref name=brit/>  The New South Wales Corps, since renamed the 102nd Regiment of Foot, was recalled to Britain and replaced by the [[73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot|73rd Regiment of Foot]] who arrived on 1 January 1810.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lachlan Macquarie: Regiments in which Macquarie Served |url=https://www.mq.edu.au/macquarie-archive/lema/military/regiments.html |website=Lachlan and Elizabeth Macquarie Archive |publisher=Macquarie University |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>  By April of that year the body guard amounted to a sergeant, a corporal and six troopers.  One of the troopers survived from King's administration but the majority were former New South Wales Corps men who had transferred to the 73rd Regiment.  At this time the supplementary pay, funded by the colonial government, stood at 1 shilling 6 pence per day for the sergeant, 1 shilling for the corporal and 6 pence for the troopers.<ref name=sargent8>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=8}}</ref>\n\nMaquarie saw the advantage of the unit in carrying dispatches and in providing protection to himself to \"visit distant Interior parts of the Colony, or penetrate into the Wild Jungles and Forests of it, inhabited by Savages, Who probably Might be induced to take a treacherous Advantage of his Unprotected Situation, Were he to go Amongst them without a Guard\".  He sought to increase their strength to 12 men but when news of this reached the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Earl of Liverpool]], he refused to grant permission and demanded the unit be disbanded.  In 1812 Maquarie requested this decision be rescinded as most other British colonies had a unit of regular or militia cavalry at their disposal; he claimed that he \"felt very much hurt\" at being \"singled out as Undeserving this Honor\".<ref name=sargent8/>  Maquarie maintained the unit until it was approved later in 1812 by Liverpool's successor, the [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Earl Bathurst]].<ref name=sargent8/><ref name=sargent9>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=9}}</ref>  Bathurst also sanctioned an increase in size to 12 troopers, plus the sergeant and corporal.<ref name=sargent9/>\n\nDespite Bathurst's permission being granted the unit remained at 8-men strong until the end of Maquarie's tenure in 1821.  The unit was kept up to strength with replacements drawn from the British regiment on garrison duty in the colony which, from 1817, was the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot|48th Regiment of Foot]].<ref name=sargent9/>  The body guard's duties at this time included escorting the governor on visits around the colony and announcing guests at the governor's balls.<ref name=sargent9/><ref name=sargent11/>  The body guard sergeant from 1808 to 1822 was Charles Whalan who became good friends with Macquarie, accompanying him on personal holidays and being one of the last people to see him off on his return to Britain in 1821.<ref name=sargent10>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=10}}</ref>\n\n== Disbandment ==\n[[File:Frederick John Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon by Sir Thomas Lawrence.jpg|thumb|Viscount Goderich]]\nThe body guard survived through the governorships of [[Thomas Brisbane]] (1821\u201325) and [[Ralph Darling]] (1825\u201331).  However, when newly arrived governor [[Richard Bourke]] disclosed an expenditure of \u00a3112 16s 6d in his December 1831 report this was queried by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies [[F. J. Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Viscount Goderich]] who ordered the unit disbanded.<ref name=sargent11/>  Bourke, who considered the title of the body guard as \"much too lofty for so trifling an establishment\", responded by establishing the Mounted Orderlies as a replacement in 1834.<ref name=sargent12/><ref name=sargent11/>  These were drawn from the [[New South Wales Mounted Police]], and commanded by Bourke's aide-de-camp.<ref name=sargent11>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=11}}</ref>  Upon hearing of this Goderich ordered their disbandment also.<ref name=sargent12/>  Bourke transferred the unit to the [[New South Wales Mounted Police]] on 1 July 1836 and they continued to serve the governor until at least 1860.<ref>{{Harvnb|Martin|1839|p=427}}</ref><ref name=sargent12/>\n\nClem Sargent, writing in 1998, stated that the ambiguous status of the Governor's Body Guard of Light Horse, was indicative of the difficulty the British government had in understanding the colony in this period.  The British were keen to restrict expenses incurred by the government of the colony and, without an understanding of the local conditions, saw no reason for the governor to have a personal body guard.<ref name=sargent12/>\n\n== Uniform and equipment ==\nThe body guard wore the British [[light dragoon]] uniform throughout its service.<ref name=sargent12>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=12}}</ref>  In the early period this was a blue tunic (with red facings) and breeches, a [[Tarleton helmet]], with red and yellow turban and a white plume with red tip and this uniform is depicted in the 1804 painting of Trooper Anzelark.<ref name=sargent6/>  The unit was armed with the [[pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre]].<ref name=sargent7/>  It is not known if the unit adopted the revised light dragoon uniform of 1812, which replaced the Tarleton with a bell top [[shako]] and introduced a new jacket.<ref name=sargent12/><ref>{{Harvnb|Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society|1941|p=341}}</ref>\n\nBy 1830 the body guard was wearing the revised light dragoon uniform of blue [[broadcloth]] jackets with scarlet facings and yellow ball buttons, brass [[Epaulette|shoulder scales]], blue cloth girdles with scarlet stripe, blue broadcloth dress trousers with scarlet stripes, blue broadcloth cloaks with scarlet facings, caps with black plumes, leather gloves and wellington boots.  Rank was indicated by chevrons in yellow lace with gold trim.  The sergeant had plated shoulder scales, lace girdles and silver trim to the cap.  When off duty the body guard wore white [[duck cloth]] trousers with buttons down the legs and there was an optional round jacket of the same material and facings as the formal jacket.<ref name=sargent12/>\n\nThe British light dragoon uniform changed again in 1831, in accordance with [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]'s wish to see them in red coats.  It is unlikely that this change was effected before the guard disbanded, though a later depiction of the Mounted Orderlies shows them in red coats.<ref name=sargent12/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography==\n*{{citation|last1=Binney |first1=Keith Robert |title=Horsemen of the First Frontier (1788\u20131900) and the Serpent's Legacy |date=2005 |publisher=Volcanic Productions |isbn=978-0-646-44865-7 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0xYF0v8doEgC |language=en}}\n*{{citation|last1=Clune |first1=David |title=The Governors of New South Wales 1788-2010 |date=2009 |publisher=Federation Press |isbn=978-1-86287-743-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rHqv_zt_veQC |language=en}}\n*{{citation  |last1=Martin |first1=Robert Montgomery |title=Statistics of the Colonies of the British Empire in the West Indies, South America, North America, Asia, Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe ...: From the Official Records of the Colonial Office |date=1839 |publisher=W.H.

However Bligh's provost marshal William Gore, later recalled being visited by members of the body guard during his imprisonment and alleged that Macarthur, who set himself up as colonial secretary, was attended by two members of the unit.<ref name=sargent7>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=7}}</ref>\n\n== Later service ==\n[[File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg|thumb|Governor Macquarie]]\n[[Lachlan Macquarie]] was dispatched by the British government to assume the office of governor and restore order arriving in December 1809.<ref name=brit/>  The New South Wales Corps, since renamed the 102nd Regiment of Foot, was recalled to Britain and replaced by the [[73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot|73rd Regiment of Foot]] who arrived on 1 January 1810.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lachlan Macquarie: Regiments in which Macquarie Served |url=https://www.mq.edu.au/macquarie-archive/lema/military/regiments.html |website=Lachlan and Elizabeth Macquarie Archive |publisher=Macquarie University |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>  By April of that year the body guard amounted to a sergeant, a corporal and six troopers.  One of the troopers survived from King's administration but the majority were former New South Wales Corps men who had transferred to the 73rd Regiment.  At this time the supplementary pay, funded by the colonial government, stood at 1 shilling 6 pence per day for the sergeant, 1 shilling for the corporal and 6 pence for the troopers.<ref name=sargent8>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=8}}</ref>\n\nMaquarie saw the advantage of the unit in carrying dispatches and in providing protection to himself to \"visit distant Interior parts of the Colony, or penetrate into the Wild Jungles and Forests of it, inhabited by Savages, Who probably Might be induced to take a treacherous Advantage of his Unprotected Situation, Were he to go Amongst them without a Guard\".  He sought to increase their strength to 12 men but when news of this reached the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Earl of Liverpool]], he refused to grant permission and demanded the unit be disbanded.  In 1812 Maquarie requested this decision be rescinded as most other British colonies had a unit of regular or militia cavalry at their disposal; he claimed that he \"felt very much hurt\" at being \"singled out as Undeserving this Honor\".<ref name=sargent8/>  Maquarie maintained the unit until it was approved later in 1812 by Liverpool's successor, the [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Earl Bathurst]].<ref name=sargent8/><ref name=sargent9>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=9}}</ref>  Bathurst also sanctioned an increase in size to 12 troopers, plus the sergeant and corporal.<ref name=sargent9/>\n\nDespite Bathurst's permission being granted the unit remained at 8-men strong until the end of Maquarie's tenure in 1821.  The unit was kept up to strength with replacements drawn from the British regiment on garrison duty in the colony which, from 1817, was the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot|48th Regiment of Foot]].<ref name=sargent9/>  The body guard's duties at this time included escorting the governor on visits around the colony and announcing guests at the governor's balls.<ref name=sargent9/><ref name=sargent11/>  The body guard sergeant from 1808 to 1822 was Charles Whalan who became good friends with Macquarie, accompanying him on personal holidays and being one of the last people to see him off on his return to Britain in 1821.<ref name=sargent10>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=10}}</ref>\n\n== Disbandment ==\n[[File:Frederick John Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon by Sir Thomas Lawrence.jpg|thumb|Viscount Goderich]]\nThe body guard survived through the governorships of [[Thomas Brisbane]] (1821-25) and [[Ralph Darling]] (1825-31).  However, when newly arrived governor [[Richard Bourke]] disclosed an expenditure of \u00a3112 16s 6d in his December 1831 report this was queried by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies [[F. J. Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Viscount Goderich]] who ordered the unit disbanded.<ref name=sargent11/>  Bourke, who considered the title of the body guard as \"much too lofty for so trifling an establishment\", responded by establishing the Mounted Orderlies as a replacement in 1834.<ref name=sargent12/><ref name=sargent11/>  These were drawn from the [[New South Wales Mounted Police]], and commanded by Bourke's aide-de-camp.<ref name=sargent11>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=11}}</ref>  Upon hearing of this Goderich ordered their disbandment also.<ref name=sargent12/>  Bourke transferred the unit to the [[New South Wales Mounted Police]] on 1 July 1836 and they continued to serve the governor until at least 1860.<ref>{{Harvnb|Martin|1839|p=427}}</ref><ref name=sargent12/>\n\nClem Sargent, writing in 1998, stated that the ambiguous status of the Governor's Body Guard of Light Horse, was indicative of the difficulty the British government had in understanding the colony in this period.  The British were keen to restrict expenses incurred by the government of the colony and, without an understanding of the local conditions, saw no reason for the governor to have a personal body guard.<ref name=sargent12/>\n\n== Uniform and equipment ==\nThe body guard wore the British [[light dragoon]] uniform throughout its service.<ref name=sargent12>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=12}}</ref>  In the early period this was a blue tunic (with red facings) and breeches, a [[Tarleton helmet]], with red and yellow turban and a white plume with red tip and this uniform is depicted in the 1804 painting of Trooper Anzelark.<ref name=sargent6/>  The unit was armed with the [[pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre]].<ref name=sargent7/>  It is not known if the unit adopted the revised light dragoon uniform of 1812, which replaced the Tarleton with a bell top [[shako]] and introduced a new jacket.<ref name=sargent12/><ref>{{Harvnb|Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society|1941|p=341}}</ref>\n\nBy 1830 the body guard was wearing the revised light dragoon uniform of blue [[broadcloth]] jackets with scarlet facings and yellow ball buttons, brass [[Epaulette|shoulder scales]], blue cloth girdles with scarlet stripe, blue broadcloth dress trousers with scarlet stripes, blue broadcloth cloaks with scarlet facings, caps with black plumes, leather gloves and wellington boots.  Rank was indicated by chevrons in yellow lace with gold trim.  The sergeant had plated shoulder scales, lace girdles and silver trim to the cap.  When off duty the body guard wore white [[duck cloth]] trousers with buttons down the legs and there was an optional round jacket of the same material and facings as the formal jacket.<ref name=sargent12/>\n\nThe British light dragoon uniform changed again in 1831, in accordance with [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]'s wish to see them in red coats.  It is unlikely that this change was effected before the guard disbanded, though a later depiction of the Mounted Orderlies shows them in red coats.<ref name=sargent12/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography==\n*{{citation|last1=Binney |first1=Keith Robert |title=Horsemen of the First Frontier (1788-1900) and the Serpent's Legacy |date=2005 |publisher=Volcanic Productions |isbn=978-0-646-44865-7 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0xYF0v8doEgC |language=en}}\n*{{citation|last1=Clune |first1=David |title=The Governors of New South Wales 1788-2010 |date=2009 |publisher=Federation Press |isbn=978-1-86287-743-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rHqv_zt_veQC |language=en}}\n*{{citation  |last1=Martin |first1=Robert Montgomery |title=Statistics of the Colonies of the British Empire in the West Indies, South America, North America, Asia, Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe ...: From the Official Records of the Colonial Office |date=1839 |publisher=W.H.
