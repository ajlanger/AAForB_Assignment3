It was modeled on similar national agencies found in Europe: the French ''L'Etablissement Central de l'A\u00e9rostation Militaire'' in [[Meudon]] (now ''[[Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales]]''), the German Aerodynamic Laboratory of the University of [[G\u00f6ttingen]], and the Russian Aerodynamic Institute of Koutchino (replaced in 1918 with the [[Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute|Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI)]], which is still in existence). The most influential agency upon which the NACA was based was the British [[Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]].\n\nIn December 1912, President [[William Howard Taft]] had appointed a National Aerodynamical Laboratory Commission chaired by [[Robert S. Woodward]], president of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. Legislation was introduced in both houses of Congress early in January 1913 to approve the commission, but when it came to a vote, the legislation was defeated.\n\n[[File:First Meeting of the NACA 1915 - GPN-2000-001571.jpg|thumb|200px|The first meeting of the NACA in 1915]]\n[[Charles D. Walcott]], secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] from 1907 to 1927, took up the effort, and in January 1915, Senator [[Benjamin R. Tillman]], and Representative [[Ernest W. Roberts]] introduced identical resolutions recommending the creation of an advisory committee as outlined by Walcott. The purpose of the committee was \"to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution, and to determine the problems which should be experimentally attacked and to discuss their solution and their application to practical questions.\" [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] wrote that he \"heartily [endorsed] the principle\" on which the legislation was based.

The white aircraft in the foreground is a [[Douglas Skyrocket]].]]\n\nOn January 29, 1920, President Wilson appointed pioneering flier and aviation engineer [[Orville Wright]] to NACA's board. By the early 1920s, it had adopted a new and more ambitious mission: to promote military and civilian aviation through applied research that looked beyond current needs. NACA researchers pursued this mission through the agency's impressive collection of in-house wind tunnels, engine test stands, and flight test facilities. Commercial and military clients were also permitted to use NACA facilities on a contract basis.\n\n;Facilities\n*[[Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]] ([[Hampton, Virginia]])\n*[[Ames Aeronautical Laboratory]] ([[Moffett Field]])\n*Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory ([[Lewis Research Center]])\n*[[Muroc Flight Test Unit]] ([[Edwards Air Force Base]])\n\nIn 1922, NACA had 100 employees. By 1938, it had 426. In addition to formal assignments, staff were encouraged to pursue unauthorized \"bootleg\" research, provided that it was not too exotic. The result was a long string of fundamental breakthroughs, including \"[[thin airfoil theory]]\" (1920s), \"[[NACA cowling|NACA engine cowl]]\" (1930s), the \"[[NACA airfoil]]\" series (1940s), and the \"[[area rule]]\" for supersonic aircraft (1950s). On the other hand, NACA's 1941 refusal to increase airspeed in their wind tunnels set [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] back a year in their quest to solve the problem of [[compressibility]] encountered in high speed dives made by the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]].<ref>Bodie, Warren M.

It was the first of many now-famous NACA and NASA wind tunnels. Although this specific wind tunnel was not unique or advanced, it enabled NACA engineers and scientists to develop and test new and advanced concepts in [[aerodynamics]] and to improve future wind tunnel design.\n\n#Atmospheric 5-ft wind tunnel (1920)\n#[[Variable Density Tunnel]] (1922)\n#Propeller research tunnel (1927)\n#High-speed 11-in wind tunnel (1928)\n#Vertical 5-ft wind tunnel (1929)\n#Atmospheric 7- by 10-ft wind tunnel (1930)\n#Full-scale 30- by 60-ft tunnel (1931)\n\n==Influence on World War II technology==\nIn the years immediately preceding World War II, NACA was involved in the development of several designs that served key roles in the war effort. When engineers at a major engine manufacturer were having issues producing [[supercharger]]s that would allow the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] to maintain power at high altitude, a team of engineers from NACA solved the problems and created the standards and testing methods used to produce effective superchargers in the future. This enabled the B-17 to be used as a key aircraft in the war effort. The designs and information gained from NACA research on the B-17 were used in nearly every major U.S. military [[powerplant]] of the Second World War. Nearly every aircraft used some form of [[forced induction]] that relied on information developed by NACA. Because of this, U.S.-produced aircraft had a significant power advantage above 15,000 feet, which was never fully countered by Axis forces.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}<!--true, but needs citations...-->\n\nAfter the war had begun, the British government sent a request to [[North American Aviation]] for a new fighter. The offered [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Tomahawk]] fighters were considered too outdated to be a feasible front line fighter by European standards, and so North American began development of a new aircraft. The British government chose a NACA-developed airfoil for the fighter, which enabled it to perform dramatically better than previous models. This aircraft became known as the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]].<ref name=\"nasa.gov\"/>\n\n==Supersonic research==\n[[File:Bell X-1 color.jpg|thumb|The NACA XS-1 ([[Bell X-1]])]]\n[[File:NACA-Ames-1958.jpg|thumb|The NACA Scientific and Engineering Staff at the [[Ames Research Center]] in Mountain View California shortly before the dissolution of NACA and the formation of NASA in 1958.]]\nAlthough the [[Bell X-1]] was commissioned by the Air Force and flown by Air Force test pilot [[Chuck Yeager]], when it exceeded [[Speed of sound|Mach 1]] NACA was officially in charge of the testing and development of the aircraft. NACA ran the experiments and data collection, and the bulk of the research used to develop the aircraft came from NACA engineer [[John Stack (engineer)|John Stack]], the head of NACA's  compressibility division.<ref name=\"nasa.gov\"/> Compressibility is a major issue as aircraft approach Mach 1, and research into solving the problem drew heavily on information collected during previous NACA wind tunnel testing to assist Lockheed with the P-38 Lightning.\n\nThe X-1 program was first envisioned in 1944 when a former NACA engineer working for Bell Aircraft<!--who?--> approached the Army for funding of a supersonic test aircraft. Neither the Army nor Bell had any experience in this area, so the majority of research came from the NACA Compressibility Research Division, which had been operating for more than a year by the time Bell began conceptual designs. The Compressibility Research Division also had years of additional research and data to pull from, as its head engineer <!--who? Stack?--> was previously head of the high speed wind tunnel division, which itself had nearly a decade of high speed test data by that time. Due to the importance of NACA involvement, Stack was personally awarded the Collier Trophy along with the owner of Bell Aircraft and test pilot Chuck Yeager.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy Research Project Winners, 1998, P.89</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dryden Flight Research Center historical data |work=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Dryden/40.html |accessdate=2006-12-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013060339/http://www1.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Dryden/40.html |archivedate=October 13, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, NACA Engineer [[Richard Whitcomb]] determined the [[area rule]] that explained [[transonic]] flow over an aircraft. The first uses of this theory were on the [[Convair F-102]] project and the [[Grumman F11F|F11F Tiger]]. The F-102 was meant to be a supersonic interceptor, but it was unable to exceed the speed of sound, despite the best effort of Convair engineers. The F-102 had actually already begun production when this was discovered, so NACA engineers were sent to quickly solve the problem at hand. The production line had to be modified to allow the modification of F-102s already in production to allow them to use the area rule. (Aircraft so altered were known as \"area ruled\" aircraft.) The design changes allowed the aircraft to exceed Mach 1, but only by a small margin, as the rest of the Convair design was not optimized for this. As the F-11F was the first design to incorporate this during initial design, it was able to break the sound barrier without having to use afterburner.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy Research Project Winners, 1998, p. 146.</ref>\n\nBecause the area rule was initially classified, it took several years for Whitcomb to be recognized for his accomplishment. In 1955 he was awarded the Collier Trophy for his work on both the Tiger and the F-102.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy P.147</ref>\n\nThe most important design resulting from the area rule was the [[B-58 Hustler]], which was already in development at the time. It was redesigned to take the area rule into effect, allowing greatly improved performance.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy Research Project Winners, 1998, P.147</ref> This was the first US supersonic bomber, and was capable of Mach 2 at a time when Soviet fighters had only just attained that speed months earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvi.com/~sr71webmaster/b58.htm|title=B-58 Hustler Records & 15,000 miles non-stop in the SR-71|first=Leland R|last=Haynes|website=www.wvi.com|accessdate=May 8, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102022453/http://www.wvi.com/~sr71webmaster/b58.htm|archivedate=November 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The area rule concept is now used in designing all transonic and supersonic aircraft.\n\nNACA experience provided a powerful model for [[World War II]] research, the postwar government laboratories, and NACA's successor, the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA).\n\nNACA also participated in development of the first aircraft to fly to the \"edge of space\", North American's [[North American X-15|X-15]].

It was modeled on similar national agencies found in Europe: the French ''L'Etablissement Central de l'A\u00e9rostation Militaire'' in [[Meudon]] (now ''[[Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales]]''), the German Aerodynamic Laboratory of the University of [[G\u00f6ttingen]], and the Russian Aerodynamic Institute of Koutchino (replaced in 1918 with the [[Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute|Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI)]], which is still in existence). The most influential agency upon which the NACA was based was the British [[Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]].\n\nIn December 1912, President [[William Howard Taft]] had appointed a National Aerodynamical Laboratory Commission chaired by [[Robert S. Woodward]], president of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. Legislation was introduced in both houses of Congress early in January 1913 to approve the commission, but when it came to a vote, the legislation was defeated.\n\n[[File:First Meeting of the NACA 1915 - GPN-2000-001571.jpg|thumb|200px|The first meeting of the NACA in 1915]]\n[[Charles D. Walcott]], secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] from 1907 to 1927, took up the effort, and in January 1915, Senator [[Benjamin R. Tillman]], and Representative [[Ernest W. Roberts]] introduced identical resolutions recommending the creation of an advisory committee as outlined by Walcott. The purpose of the committee was \"to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution, and to determine the problems which should be experimentally attacked and to discuss their solution and their application to practical questions.\" [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] wrote that he \"heartily [endorsed] the principle\" on which the legislation was based.

The white aircraft in the foreground is a [[Douglas Skyrocket]].]]\n\nOn January 29, 1920, President Wilson appointed pioneering flier and aviation engineer [[Orville Wright]] to NACA's board. By the early 1920s, it had adopted a new and more ambitious mission: to promote military and civilian aviation through applied research that looked beyond current needs. NACA researchers pursued this mission through the agency's impressive collection of in-house wind tunnels, engine test stands, and flight test facilities. Commercial and military clients were also permitted to use NACA facilities on a contract basis.\n\n;Facilities\n*[[Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]] ([[Hampton, Virginia]])\n*[[Ames Aeronautical Laboratory]] ([[Moffett Field]])\n*Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory ([[Lewis Research Center]])\n*[[Muroc Flight Test Unit]] ([[Edwards Air Force Base]])\n\nIn 1922, NACA had 100 employees. By 1938, it had 426. In addition to formal assignments, staff were encouraged to pursue unauthorized \"bootleg\" research, provided that it was not too exotic. The result was a long string of fundamental breakthroughs, including \"[[thin airfoil theory]]\" (1920s), \"[[NACA cowling|NACA engine cowl]]\" (1930s), the \"[[NACA airfoil]]\" series (1940s), and the \"[[area rule]]\" for supersonic aircraft (1950s). On the other hand, NACA's 1941 refusal to increase airspeed in their wind tunnels set [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] back a year in their quest to solve the problem of [[compressibility]] encountered in high speed dives made by the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]].<ref>Bodie, Warren M.

It was the first of many now-famous NACA and NASA wind tunnels. Although this specific wind tunnel was not unique or advanced, it enabled NACA engineers and scientists to develop and test new and advanced concepts in [[aerodynamics]] and to improve future wind tunnel design.\n\n#Atmospheric 5-ft wind tunnel (1920)\n#[[Variable Density Tunnel]] (1922)\n#Propeller research tunnel (1927)\n#High-speed 11-in wind tunnel (1928)\n#Vertical 5-ft wind tunnel (1929)\n#Atmospheric 7- by 10-ft wind tunnel (1930)\n#Full-scale 30- by 60-ft tunnel (1931)\n\n==Influence on World War II technology==\nIn the years immediately preceding World War II, NACA was involved in the development of several designs that served key roles in the war effort. When engineers at a major engine manufacturer were having issues producing [[supercharger]]s that would allow the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] to maintain power at high altitude, a team of engineers from NACA solved the problems and created the standards and testing methods used to produce effective superchargers in the future. This enabled the B-17 to be used as a key aircraft in the war effort. The designs and information gained from NACA research on the B-17 were used in nearly every major U.S. military [[powerplant]] of the Second World War. Nearly every aircraft used some form of [[forced induction]] that relied on information developed by NACA. Because of this, U.S.-produced aircraft had a significant power advantage above 15,000 feet, which was never fully countered by Axis forces.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}<!--true, but needs citations...-->\n\nAfter the war had begun, the British government sent a request to [[North American Aviation]] for a new fighter. The offered [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Tomahawk]] fighters were considered too outdated to be a feasible front line fighter by European standards, and so North American began development of a new aircraft. The British government chose a NACA-developed airfoil for the fighter, which enabled it to perform dramatically better than previous models. This aircraft became known as the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]].<ref name=\"nasa.gov\"/>\n\n==Supersonic research==\n[[File:Bell X-1 color.jpg|thumb|The NACA XS-1 ([[Bell X-1]])]]\n[[File:NACA-Ames-1958.jpg|thumb|The NACA Scientific and Engineering Staff at the [[Ames Research Center]] in Mountain View California shortly before the dissolution of NACA and the formation of NASA in 1958.]]\nAlthough the [[Bell X-1]] was commissioned by the Air Force and flown by Air Force test pilot [[Chuck Yeager]], when it exceeded [[Speed of sound|Mach 1]] NACA was officially in charge of the testing and development of the aircraft. NACA ran the experiments and data collection, and the bulk of the research used to develop the aircraft came from NACA engineer [[John Stack (engineer)|John Stack]], the head of NACA's  compressibility division.<ref name=\"nasa.gov\"/> Compressibility is a major issue as aircraft approach Mach 1, and research into solving the problem drew heavily on information collected during previous NACA wind tunnel testing to assist Lockheed with the P-38 Lightning.\n\nThe X-1 program was first envisioned in 1944 when a former NACA engineer working for Bell Aircraft<!--who?--> approached the Army for funding of a supersonic test aircraft. Neither the Army nor Bell had any experience in this area, so the majority of research came from the NACA Compressibility Research Division, which had been operating for more than a year by the time Bell began conceptual designs. The Compressibility Research Division also had years of additional research and data to pull from, as its head engineer <!--who? Stack?--> was previously head of the high speed wind tunnel division, which itself had nearly a decade of high speed test data by that time. Due to the importance of NACA involvement, Stack was personally awarded the Collier Trophy along with the owner of Bell Aircraft and test pilot Chuck Yeager.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy Research Project Winners, 1998, P.89</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dryden Flight Research Center historical data |work=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Dryden/40.html |accessdate=2006-12-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013060339/http://www1.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Dryden/40.html |archivedate=October 13, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, NACA Engineer [[Richard Whitcomb]] determined the [[area rule]] that explained [[transonic]] flow over an aircraft. The first uses of this theory were on the [[Convair F-102]] project and the [[Grumman F11F|F11F Tiger]]. The F-102 was meant to be a supersonic interceptor, but it was unable to exceed the speed of sound, despite the best effort of Convair engineers. The F-102 had actually already begun production when this was discovered, so NACA engineers were sent to quickly solve the problem at hand. The production line had to be modified to allow the modification of F-102s already in production to allow them to use the area rule. (Aircraft so altered were known as \"area ruled\" aircraft.) The design changes allowed the aircraft to exceed Mach 1, but only by a small margin, as the rest of the Convair design was not optimized for this. As the F-11F was the first design to incorporate this during initial design, it was able to break the sound barrier without having to use afterburner.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy Research Project Winners, 1998, p. 146.</ref>\n\nBecause the area rule was initially classified, it took several years for Whitcomb to be recognized for his accomplishment. In 1955 he was awarded the Collier Trophy for his work on both the Tiger and the F-102.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy P.147</ref>\n\nThe most important design resulting from the area rule was the [[B-58 Hustler]], which was already in development at the time. It was redesigned to take the area rule into effect, allowing greatly improved performance.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy Research Project Winners, 1998, P.147</ref> This was the first US supersonic bomber, and was capable of Mach 2 at a time when Soviet fighters had only just attained that speed months earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvi.com/~sr71webmaster/b58.htm|title=B-58 Hustler Records & 15,000 miles non-stop in the SR-71|first=Leland R|last=Haynes|website=www.wvi.com|accessdate=May 8, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102022453/http://www.wvi.com/~sr71webmaster/b58.htm|archivedate=November 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The area rule concept is now used in designing all transonic and supersonic aircraft.\n\nNACA experience provided a powerful model for [[World War II]] research, the postwar government laboratories, and NACA's successor, the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA).\n\nNACA also participated in development of the first aircraft to fly to the \"edge of space\", North American's [[North American X-15|X-15]].
