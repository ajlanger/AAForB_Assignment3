The Vishaka Guidelines were certain procedures to be followed in cases of workplace sexual abuse. These guidelines were formulated after the landmark case ''[[Vishakha and others v State of Rajasthan|Vishaka and others v. State of Rajasthan]].'' This case was brought to the Supreme Court because of the sheer inability of the High Court of Rajasthan to provide justice to [[Bhanwari Devi]] who was part of Women's Development Program of the Rajasthan Government. She was brutally gang raped for stopping a child marriage being conducted in a town. This was a part of her duties as a member of the Development Program to stop any illegal activity conducted against children and women. Moreover, this Act uses the definition of sexual harassment laid down by the Supreme Court in ''[[Vishakha and others v State of Rajasthan]].<ref name=\"ToI1\">Chakrabarty, Rakhi (4 September 2012) [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-04/india/33581408_1_internal-complaints-committee-physical-contact-and-advances-sexually-coloured-remarks \"Sexual harassment at workplace Bill passed\"].

Dr. Medha Kotwal of Aalochana (an NGO) highlighted a number of individual cases of sexual harassment stating that the [[Vishaka Guidelines|Vishakha Guidelines]] were not being effectively implemented. Converting the letter into a writ petition, the Supreme Court took cognizance and undertook monitoring of implementation of the Vishakha Guidelines across the country.

They called out the fact that there is no stipulated liability for employers in cases of employee-to-employee harassment, something upheld in many other countries. They also viewed the provision that employers are obligated to address grievances in a timely manner at the workplace as  problematic because of potentially uncooperative employees. Furthermore, the law requires a third-party [[non-governmental organisation]] to be involved, which could make employers less comfortable in reporting grievances, due to confidentiality concerns.<ref name=\"lexology\"/>\n\nCompliance to this statute has so far been left to the vagaries of the employers and government has not taken any significant step to enforce the law so far.

The Vishaka Guidelines were certain procedures to be followed in cases of workplace sexual abuse. These guidelines were formulated after the landmark case ''[[Vishakha and others v State of Rajasthan|Vishaka and others v. State of Rajasthan]].'' This case was brought to the Supreme Court because of the sheer inability of the High Court of Rajasthan to provide justice to [[Bhanwari Devi]] who was part of Women's Development Program of the Rajasthan Government. She was brutally gang raped for stopping a child marriage being conducted in a town. This was a part of her duties as a member of the Development Program to stop any illegal activity conducted against children and women. Moreover this Act uses the definition of sexual harassment laid down by the Supreme Court in ''[[Vishakha and others v State of Rajasthan]]. <ref name=\"ToI1\">Chakrabarty, Rakhi (4 September 2012) [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-04/india/33581408_1_internal-complaints-committee-physical-contact-and-advances-sexually-coloured-remarks \"Sexual harassment at workplace Bill passed\"].

This case established that actions resulting in a violation of one's rights to \u2018Gender Equality\u2019 and \u2018Life and Liberty\u2019 are in fact a violation of the victim\u2019s fundamental right under Article 19 (1) g.

A.K Chopra ((1999) 1 SCC 759) reiterated the law laid down in the Vishakha Judgment. Dr. Medha Kotwal of Aalochana (an NGO) highlighted a number of individual cases of sexual harassment stating that the [[Vishaka Guidelines|Vishakha Guidelines]] were not being effectively implemented. Converting the letter into a writ petition, the Supreme Court took cognizance and undertook monitoring of implementation of the Vishakha Guidelines across the country. The Supreme Court asserted that in case of a non-compliance or non-adherence of the Vishakha Guidelines, it would be open to the aggrieved persons to approach the respective High Courts. <ref name=\"legalfront.in\" />\n\nThe legislative progress of the Act was a long process where the Bill was first introduced by women and child development minister [[Krishna Tirath]] in 2007 and approved by the [[Union Cabinet]] in January 2010.

They called out the fact that there is no stipulated liability for employers in cases of employee-to-employee harassment, something upheld in many other countries. They also viewed the provision that employers are obligated to address grievances in a timely manner at the workplace as  problematic because of potentially uncooperative employees. Furthermore, the law requires a third-party [[non-governmental organisation]] to be involved, which could make employers less comfortable in reporting grievances, due to confidentiality concerns.<ref name=\"lexology\"/>\n\nCompliance to this statute has so far been left to the vagaries of the employers and government has not taken any significant step to enforce the law so far.
