Get Married\" in which he attempts to present an argument as to why marriage is beneficial to men. The video was very poorly received; as of March 2020, the video has received more than twice as many downvotes as upvotes. Wilcox's lecture became a target of ridicule and vitriol via numerous video responses from users who identify as [[Men Going Their Own Way|MGTOW]] or as being part of the Men's Rights movement. Among the criticisms were Wilcox's failure to mention biased family courts that often result in fathers being unjustly cut off from their children as well as divorce settlements that frequently leave men financially ruined. Wilcox was also accused of being condescending and out of touch regarding the current state of the marriage institution.\n\nWilcox attempted to address the grievances in an article for The Federalist.<ref>http://thefederalist.com/2016/05/19/the-divorce-revolution-has-bred-an-army-of-woman-haters/ </ref>\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n===Books===\n* ''Soft Patriarchs and New Men: How Christianity Shapes Fathers and Husbands'', The University of Chicago Press, 2004\n* ''Gender and Parenthood: Biological and Social Scientific Perspectives'', Columbia University Press, 2013\n* ''Whither the Child?
