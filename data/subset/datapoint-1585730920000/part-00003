It was formed under the mandate of the 1987 [[Indo-Sri Lankan Accord]] that aimed to end the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] between  [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Sri Lankan Tamil nationalists]] such as the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) and the [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces|Sri Lankan military]].{{Ref|1}}\n\nThe main task of the IPKF was to disarm the different terrorist groups, not just the LTTE. It was to be quickly followed by the formation of an Interim Administrative Council. These were the tasks as per the terms of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, signed at the behest of Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. Given the escalation of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and with the pouring of refugees into India, Gandhi took the decisive step to push this accord through. The IPKF was inducted into Sri Lanka on the request of Sri Lankan President [[J. R. Jayewardene]] under the terms of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord.<ref name=Hennayake/>\n\nThe force was initially not expected to be involved in any significant combat by the [[Indian Armed Forces#Organization and command structure|Indian High Command]].<ref name=dixitrediff/> However, within a few months, the IPKF became embroiled in battle with the LTTE to enforce peace. The differences started with LTTE trying to dominate the Interim Administrative Council, and also refusing to disarm, which was a pre-condition to enforce peace in the island. Soon, these differences led to the LTTE attacking the IPKF, at which point the IPKF decided to disarm the LTTE militants, by force if required. In the two years it was in northern Sri Lanka, the IPKF launched a number of combat operations aimed at destroying the LTTE-led insurgency. It soon escalated into repeated skirmishes between the IPKF and LTTE.\n\nThe IPKF began withdrawing from Sri Lanka in 1989, on the orders of the newly elected Sri Lankan President [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] and following the election of the [[V. P. Singh]] government in India.<ref name=dixitrediff/> The last IPKF contingents left Sri Lanka in March 1990.\n\nIndia's battle in Sri Lanka is often compared and called as 'India's Vietnam' by International Media.<ref>https://www.ozy.com/flashback/indias-vietnam-moment-the-ill-advised-war-that-ended-in-humiliation/81702</ref><ref>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/indian-army-sri-lanka-ltte-liberation-tigers-of-tamil-eelam-jaffna-indian-peace-keeping-force-ipkf-in-fact-on-indian-military-decisions-of-today-shadow-of-a-pyrrhic-victory-yesterday-4887671/</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Operation Poomalai}}\nSri Lanka, from the early 1980s, was facing increasingly violent ethnic strife in the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. The [[origins of the Sri Lankan Civil War]] can be traced to the [[Sri Lankan independence movement|independence of Sri Lanka]] in 1948, after the end of [[British Ceylon|British rule]]. At the time, a [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] majority government was instituted. This government, which included the Tamil Congress, passed legislation deemed discriminatory by some against the [[Tamils of Sri Lanka|Tamil]] minority in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn the 1970s, two major Tamil [[List of political parties in Sri Lanka|parties]], the [[Tamil Congress]] and a split, the [[Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi|Federal Party]] united to form the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF), a [[Separatism|separatist]] Tamil nationalist group that agitated for a separate state of [[Tamil Eelam]] in north and eastern Sri Lanka<ref name= GlobSec>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/ltte.htm|title=Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), World Tamil Association (WTA), World Tamil Movement (WTM), Federation of Associations of Canadian Tamils (FACT), Ellalan Force.

Emboldened by this support, supporters in Tamil Nadu provided a sanctuary for the separatists and helped the LTTE smuggle arms and ammunition into Sri Lanka, making them the strongest force on the island. In fact in 1982, the LTTE supremo Prabhakran was arrested by the police in Tamil Nadu, for a shoot-out with his rival Uma Maheswaran, in the middle of the city. Both of them were arrested and later released by the police. This activity was left unchecked as India's regional and domestic interests wanted to limit foreign intervention on what was deemed as an ethnic issue between the Tamils and the Sinhalese. To this end, the Indira Gandhi government sought to make it clear to Sri Lankan president [[Junius Richard Jayewardene]] that armed intervention in support of the Tamil movement was an option India would consider if diplomatic solutions should fail.<ref name=Haggerty>'''India's Regional Security Doctrine.'''\nHagerty D.T.

On 4 June 1987, in a bid to provide relief, the [[Indian Air Force]] mounted [[Operation Poomalai]]. Five [[Antonov An-32]]s under [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] cover flew over Jaffna to airdrop 25 tons of supplies, all the time keeping well within the range of Sri Lankan radar coverage. At the same time the Sri Lankan Ambassador to New Delhi, [[Bernard Tilakaratna]], was summoned to the Foreign Office to be informed by the [[Indian Foreign Minister|Minister of State, External Affairs]], [[K.

The LTTE casualties are not known.\n\n===Intelligence Failures===\nThe Indian intelligence agencies failed to consistently provide accurate information to the forces. One example is the [[Jaffna football ground massacre]]. The LTTE's [[disinformation]] machinery leaked fake information to the Indian army that the LTTE leader [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] was hiding in a building near the Jaffna university football ground.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A major operational plan was chalked out by the Indian generals to capture him alive. The plan involved airdropping commandos on the ground, while tank formations would move to surround the area, to prevent anyone from the stadium and its surrounding buildings to escape.\n\nHowever, when the plan was executed, the Indian troops came under heavy attack from hidden LTTE sharpshooters. the tanks moving on the ground were ensnared by anti-tank mines placed by the LTTE fighters. This resulted in heavy losses for the Indian side.<ref>citation needed</ref> According to later accounts, the LTTE leader, Prabhakaran was not in the area at the time of the operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/DF08Df01.html|title=Asia Times: India/Pakistan|website=www.atimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe IPKF complained that accurate maps of the operational theaters were not made available to them by the various intelligence agencies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThere was also a case where an agent of [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW) was killed in an ambush set up by the IPKF. He had been acting on orders to carry out back channel diplomacy and peacetalks with the [[LTTE]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Impact==\nThe IPKF mission while having gained tactical successes, did not succeed in its intended goals. On 21 May 1991, the LTTE [[Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi|assassinated]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]] for his role in sending the IPKF to Sri Lanka.\n\nThe primary impact of the IPKF, has been that it shaped India's [[counter-insurgency]] techniques and military doctrine. On the international scene, it does not find significant mention in National or International military history. The political fallout, the IPKF's casualties, as well as the deterioration of international relations has however shaped India's foreign policy towards the Sri Lankan conflict. (see below)\n\n===Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi===\nThe decision to send the IPKF in Sri Lanka was taken by then prime-minister of India, [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who held office until 1989. The operation in Sri Lanka was one of the factors that led to the ouster of the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress government in 1989.\n\nRajiv Gandhi was assassinated at a rally at [[Sriperumbudur]] on 21 May 1991, while he was campaigning for re-election during the 1991 Indian General Election, by a [[suicide bomber]], who was a member of the LTTE, named [[Thenmuli Rajaratnam|Dhanu]].\n\n===India's foreign policy===\nThe debacle that was IPKF's intervention in Sri Lanka is raised at times in Indian political discourse whenever the situation in Sri Lanka shows signs of deteriorating, and there is a question of intervening; or, in Sri Lankan politics (particularly by the LTTE), when it is proposed that India, or, more broadly, other foreigners, ought to have a role in promoting peace on the island nation.\n\nAs a result, relations between India and Sri Lanka became extremely sour and India vowed never to offer any military help to Sri Lanka again. This policy has not been changed since and no defence pact has been signed between India and Sri Lanka. India has never been directly involved in the peace talks between the LTTE and Sri Lanka but has supported Norway's efforts.\n\n==Controversies==\nThe IPKF's role in the Sri Lankan conflict was much maligned by voices both there and at home at the time. It was alleged by the LTTE to have engaged in a number of incidents of human rights violation. Some neutral organisations also alleged the IPKF and LTTE engaged with scant regard for civilian safety and to have violated human rights. These allegations led to considerable outcry and public resentment within Sri Lanka as well as India, especially in [[Tamil Nadu]], where the IPKF came to be viewed as an invading and oppressing force.\n\nIndian forces were accused of indulging in number of civilian massacres, [[Involuntary disappearances]] and rapes during their time in the [[Northeastern province of Sri Lanka]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://nesohr.org/inception-sept2007/human-rights-reports/StatisticsOnCiviliansAffectedByWar.pdf|title= Statistics on civilians affected by war from 1974 \u2013 2004|accessdate= 2008-11-15|work= NESOHR|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225211013/http://nesohr.org/inception-sept2007/human-rights-reports/StatisticsOnCiviliansAffectedByWar.pdf|archive-date= 25 February 2009|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=CM>{{cite book | last=McDowell | first=Chris | title= A Tamil Asylum Diaspora: Sri Lankan Migration, Settlement and Politics in Switzerland (Studies in Forced Migration)  | year=1996 | publisher= Berghahn Books |isbn=1-57181-917-7}} p.181</ref> These include complicity in the incidents such as [[1989 Valvettithurai massacre|Valvettiturai massacre]] in which on\n2, 3, and 4 August 1989 over 50 Tamils were massacred by the Indian Peace Keeping Force in [[Valvettiturai]], Jaffna.

It was formed under the mandate of the 1987 [[Indo-Sri Lankan Accord]] that aimed to end the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] between  [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Sri Lankan Tamil nationalists]] such as the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) and the [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces|Sri Lankan military]].{{Ref|1}}\n\nThe main task of the IPKF was to disarm the different terrorist groups, not just the LTTE. It was to be quickly followed by the formation of an Interim Administrative Council. These were the tasks as per the terms of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, signed at the behest of Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. Given the escalation of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and with the pouring of refugees into India, Gandhi took the decisive step to push this accord through. The IPKF was inducted into Sri Lanka on the request of Sri Lankan President [[J. R. Jayewardene]] under the terms of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord.<ref name=Hennayake/>\n\nThe force was initially not expected to be involved in any significant combat by the [[Indian Armed Forces#Organization and command structure|Indian High Command]].<ref name=dixitrediff/> However, within a few months, the IPKF became embroiled in battle with the LTTE to enforce peace. The differences started with LTTE trying to dominate the Interim Administrative Council, and also refusing to disarm, which was a pre-condition to enforce peace in the island. Soon, these differences led to the LTTE attacking the IPKF, at which point the IPKF decided to disarm the LTTE militants, by force if required. In the two years it was in northern Sri Lanka, the IPKF launched a number of combat operations aimed at destroying the LTTE-led insurgency. It soon escalated into repeated skirmishes between the IPKF and LTTE.\n\nThe IPKF began withdrawing from Sri Lanka in 1989, on the orders of the newly elected Sri Lankan President [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] and following the election of the [[V. P. Singh]] government in India.<ref name=dixitrediff/> The last IPKF contingents left Sri Lanka in March 1990.\n\nIndia's battle in Sri Lanka is often compared and called as 'India's Vietnam' by International Media.<ref>https://www.ozy.com/flashback/indias-vietnam-moment-the-ill-advised-war-that-ended-in-humiliation/81702</ref><ref>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/indian-army-sri-lanka-ltte-liberation-tigers-of-tamil-eelam-jaffna-indian-peace-keeping-force-ipkf-in-fact-on-indian-military-decisions-of-today-shadow-of-a-pyrrhic-victory-yesterday-4887671/</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Operation Poomalai}}\nSri Lanka, from the early 1980s, was facing increasingly violent ethnic strife in the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. The [[origins of the Sri Lankan Civil War]] can be traced to the [[Sri Lankan independence movement|independence of Sri Lanka]] in 1948, after the end of [[British Ceylon|British rule]]. At the time, a [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] majority government was instituted. This government, which included the Tamil Congress, passed legislation deemed discriminatory by some against the [[Tamils of Sri Lanka|Tamil]] minority in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn the 1970s, two major Tamil [[List of political parties in Sri Lanka|parties]], the [[Tamil Congress]] and a split, the [[Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi|Federal Party]] united to form the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF), a [[Separatism|separatist]] Tamil nationalist group that agitated for a separate state of [[Tamil Eelam]] in north and eastern Sri Lanka<ref name= GlobSec>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/ltte.htm|title=Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), World Tamil Association (WTA), World Tamil Movement (WTM), Federation of Associations of Canadian Tamils (FACT), Ellalan Force.

Emboldened by this support, supporters in Tamil Nadu provided a sanctuary for the separatists and helped the LTTE smuggle arms and ammunition into Sri Lanka, making them the strongest force on the island. In fact in 1982, the LTTE supremo Prabhakran was arrested by the police in Tamil Nadu, for a shoot-out with his rival Uma Maheswaran, in the middle of the city. Both of them were arrested and later released by the police. This activity was left unchecked as India's regional and domestic interests wanted to limit foreign intervention on what was deemed as an ethnic issue between the Tamils and the Sinhalese. To this end, the Indira Gandhi government sought to make it clear to Sri Lankan president [[Junius Richard Jayewardene]] that armed intervention in support of the Tamil movement was an option India would consider if diplomatic solutions should fail.<ref name=Haggerty>'''India's Regional Security Doctrine.'''\nHagerty D.T.

The riots only aided in the deterioration of the ethnic relations. Militant factions, including the LTTE, at this time recruited in large numbers and continued building on popular Tamil dissent and stepped up the [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]]. By May 1985, the guerrillas were strong enough to launch an attack on [[Anuradhapura]], attacking the [[Sri Maha Bodhi|Bodhi Tree shrine]]\u2013a sacred site for Buddhist Sinhalese\u2013followed by a rampage through the town. At least 150 civilians died in the hour-long attack.\n\nGandhi's government attempted to re-establish friendly relations with the various factions in Sri Lanka while maintaining diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the conflict as well as limiting overt aid to the Tamil fighters.<ref name=Haggerty/><ref name=fo>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/india/raw/|title=Research and Analysis Wing.

On 4 June 1987, in a bid to provide relief, the [[Indian Air Force]] mounted [[Operation Poomalai]]. Five [[Antonov An-32]]s under [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] cover flew over Jaffna to airdrop 25 tons of supplies, all the time keeping well within the range of Sri Lankan radar coverage. At the same time the Sri Lankan Ambassador to New Delhi, [[Bernard Tilakaratna]], was summoned to the Foreign Office to be informed by the [[Indian Foreign Minister|Minister of State, External Affairs]], [[K. Natwar Singh]], of the ongoing operation and also indicated that the operation was expected not to be hindered by the [[Sri Lankan Air Force]].

One example is the [[Jaffna football ground massacre]]. The LTTE's [[disinformation]] machinery leaked fake information to the Indian army that the LTTE leader [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] was hiding in a building near the Jaffna university football ground.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A major operational plan was chalked out by the Indian generals to capture him alive. The plan involved airdropping commandos on the ground, while tank formations would move to surround the area, to prevent anyone from the stadium and its surrounding buildings to escape.\n\nHowever, when the plan was executed, the Indian troops came under heavy attack from hidden LTTE sharpshooters. the tanks moving on the ground were ensnared by anti-tank mines placed by the LTTE fighters. This resulted in heavy losses for the Indian side.<ref>citation needed</ref> According to later accounts, the LTTE leader, Prabhakaran was not in the area at the time of the operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/DF08Df01.html|title=Asia Times: India/Pakistan|website=www.atimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe IPKF complained that accurate maps of the operational theaters were not made available to them by the various intelligence agencies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThere was also a case where an agent of [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW) was killed in an ambush set up by the IPKF. He had been acting on orders to carry out back channel diplomacy and peacetalks with the [[LTTE]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Impact==\nThe IPKF mission while having gained tactical successes, did not succeed in its intended goals. On 21 May 1991, the LTTE [[Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi|assassinated]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]] for his role in sending the IPKF to Sri Lanka.\n\nThe primary impact of the IPKF, has been that it shaped India's [[counter-insurgency]] techniques and military doctrine. On the international scene, it does not find significant mention in National or International military history. The political fallout, the IPKF's casualties, as well as the deterioration of international relations has however shaped India's foreign policy towards the Sri Lankan conflict. (see below)\n\n===Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi===\nThe decision to send the IPKF in Sri Lanka was taken by then prime-minister of India, [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who held office until 1989. The operation in Sri Lanka was one of the factors that led to the ouster of the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress government in 1989.\n\nRajiv Gandhi was assassinated at a rally at [[Sriperumbudur]] on 21 May 1991, while he was campaigning for re-election during the 1991 Indian General Election, by a [[suicide bomber]], who was a member of the LTTE, named [[Thenmuli Rajaratnam|Dhanu]].\n\n===India's foreign policy===\nThe debacle that was IPKF's intervention in Sri Lanka is raised at times in Indian political discourse whenever the situation in Sri Lanka shows signs of deteriorating, and there is a question of intervening; or, in Sri Lankan politics (particularly by the LTTE), when it is proposed that India, or, more broadly, other foreigners, ought to have a role in promoting peace on the island nation.\n\nAs a result, relations between India and Sri Lanka became extremely sour and India vowed never to offer any military help to Sri Lanka again. This policy has not been changed since and no defence pact has been signed between India and Sri Lanka. India has never been directly involved in the peace talks between the LTTE and Sri Lanka but has supported Norway's efforts.\n\n==Controversies==\nThe IPKF's role in the Sri Lankan conflict was much maligned by voices both there and at home at the time. It was alleged by the LTTE to have engaged in a number of incidents of human rights violation. Some neutral organisations also alleged the IPKF and LTTE engaged with scant regard for civilian safety and to have violated human rights. These allegations led to considerable outcry and public resentment within Sri Lanka as well as India, especially in [[Tamil Nadu]], where the IPKF came to be viewed as an invading and oppressing force.\n\nIndian forces were accused of indulging in number of civilian massacres, [[Involuntary disappearances]] and rapes during their time in the [[Northeastern province of Sri Lanka]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://nesohr.org/inception-sept2007/human-rights-reports/StatisticsOnCiviliansAffectedByWar.pdf|title= Statistics on civilians affected by war from 1974 \u2013 2004|accessdate= 2008-11-15|work= NESOHR|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225211013/http://nesohr.org/inception-sept2007/human-rights-reports/StatisticsOnCiviliansAffectedByWar.pdf|archive-date= 25 February 2009|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=CM>{{cite book | last=McDowell | first=Chris | title= A Tamil Asylum Diaspora: Sri Lankan Migration, Settlement and Politics in Switzerland (Studies in Forced Migration)  | year=1996 | publisher= Berghahn Books |isbn=1-57181-917-7}} p.181</ref> These include complicity in the incidents such as [[1989 Valvettithurai massacre|Valvettiturai massacre]] in which on\n2, 3, and 4 August 1989 over 50 Tamils were massacred by the Indian Peace Keeping Force in [[Valvettiturai]], Jaffna.

The then Sri Lankan government accused the [[Madras Regiment]] posted in the [[Trincomalee]] district of complicity, although the Indian officials denied responsibility, they withdrew the Madras Regiment from Trincomalee district.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/DD20Df03.html|title=Chapter 36: Indians rule the roost |accessdate=2007-01-30 |work=Asian Times}}</ref>\n\n==War Memorial==\nThe Sri Lankan government had mooted the idea of a war memorial to those soldiers of the IPKF who lost their lives during the peacekeeping mission, in the early Nineties during [[Ranasinge Premadasa|President Premadasa]]'s rule. The memorial was finally constructed in [[Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte]] [http://goo.gl/maps/gOqoz] on the outskirts of Colombo in 2008. The names of the 1200 soldiers who died are inscribed on black marble. The first official memorial service was held on 15 August 2010 when the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Shri Ashok Kantha laid a wreath to honour the dead. The absence of a representative of the Sri Lankan government has been criticised by Indian ex-servicemen who had served in the conflict.<ref>{{aut|Patranobis, Sutirtho}}.
