He was a pioneer in the fields of [[machine translation]] and formal [[linguistics]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn '''Oscar Westreich''' in Vienna, [[Austria-Hungary]], he was raised in [[Berlin]]. In 1933 he emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] with the [[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, and briefly joined the [[kibbutz]] [[Tirat Zvi]] before settling in Jerusalem and marrying Shulamith.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], he served in the [[Jewish Brigade]] of the British Army. He fought with the [[Haganah]] during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], losing an eye.\n\nBar-Hillel received his PhD in Philosophy from the [[Hebrew University]] where he also studied mathematics under [[Abraham Fraenkel]], with whom he eventually coauthored ''Foundations of Set Theory'' (1958, 1973).\n\nBar-Hillel was a major disciple of [[Rudolf Carnap]], whose ''Logical Syntax of Language'' much influenced him. He began a correspondence with Carnap in the 1940s, which led to a 1950 post-doctorate under Carnap at the [[University of Chicago]], and to his collaborating on Carnap's 1952 ''An Outline of the Theory of Semantic Information''.\n\nBar-Hillel then took up a position at [[MIT]], where he was the first academic to work full-time in the field of [[Machine Translation]]. Bar-Hillel organised the first International Conference on Machine Translation in 1952. Later he expressed doubts that general-purpose fully automatic high-quality machine translation would ever be feasible.{{ref|fahqut1}}{{ref|fahqut2}} He was also a pioneer in the field of [[information retrieval]].\n\nIn 1953, Bar-Hillel joined the [[philosophy]] department at the [[Hebrew University]], where he taught until his death at age 60. His teachings and writings strongly influenced an entire generation of Israeli philosophers and linguists, including [[Asa Kasher]] and [[Avishai Margalit]]. In 1953, he founded a pioneering algebraic-computational linguistic group, and in 1961 he contributed to the proof of the [[pumping lemma]] for [[context-free languages]] (sometimes called the Bar-Hillel lemma). Bar-Hillel helped found the Hebrew University's department of [[Philosophy of Science]]. From 1966 to 1969 Bar-Hillel presided over the Division for Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science of the\n[[International Union of History and Philosophy of Science]].\n\n[[File:Prof. Daniel Kahneman and Prof. Maya Bar Hillel 2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Maya Bar Hillel]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]]]]\nBar-Hillel's daughter [[Maya Bar-Hillel]] is a [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologist]] at the [[Hebrew University]], known for her collaborations with [[Amos Tversky]] and for her role in critiquing [[Bible code]] study. His other daughter, Mira Bar-Hillel, is a freelance journalist who has worked for the ''[[London Evening Standard]]''.
