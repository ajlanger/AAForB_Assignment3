During a successful career at club level, lasting from 1986 to 2006, Desailly won several titles, including [[UEFA Champions League]] medals with both [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] and [[A.C. Milan]], and also played for [[FC Nantes|Nantes]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], among others teams. At international level, he collected 116 caps between 1993 and 2004, scoring 3 goals, and was a member of the [[France national football team|France international squads]] that won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].\n\n==Club career==\nMarcel Desailly was born as Odenke Abbey on 7 September 1968 in [[Accra]], Ghana, the son of Ghanaian parents. He had his name changed when his mother married the head of the French Consulate in Accra, who adopted all of her children (the former professional footballer [[Seth Adonkor]], seven years his elder, was a half-brother of his). The family relocated to France when Desailly was four years old. Following Adonkor's lead, he began his career at [[FC Nantes]]. There, as part of the famed FC Nantes youth programme, he played alongside a young [[Didier Deschamps]], who was a very good central back, who became his closest friend. Desailly turned professional in 1986, two years after his half-brother had died in a car accident. In 1992, he moved to [[Olympique de Marseille]], where he reunited with Deschamps, and won the [[UEFA Champions League]] the following year. In 1994, while playing for [[A.C. Milan]], he again won the Cup (scoring in the [[1994 UEFA Champions League Final|final]] himself), being the first player to win the Cup in consecutive seasons with different clubs. During his time in Milan he won two Italian league titles, in 1994 and 1996. Although he preferred to be deployed as a [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] or [[central defender]], roles which he played during his time in France,<ref name=\"The five players Fabio Capello made superstars\">{{cite news | date=16 December 2007| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/2328637/The-five-players-Fabio-Capello-made-superstars.html | title=The five players Fabio Capello made superstars |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| accessdate=16 December 2007 }}</ref> he found much success playing as a [[Defensive midfielder|defensive midfield]] for Milan, alongside [[Demetrio Albertini]], due to the presence of several other established central defenders at the club, such as [[Franco Baresi]], [[Alessandro Costacurta]] and [[Filippo Galli]].\n\nDesailly then moved to the English club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 1998 for \u00a34.6m,<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-desailly-plans-to-join-lazio-next-summer-1133950.html \"Desailly plans to join Lazio next summer\"].

It was at Chelsea that Desailly formed a formidable partnership with [[Frank Leboeuf]].\n\nHe picked up one major trophy in his six seasons with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], being on the winning side in their [[FA Cup]] triumph over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in [[2000 FA Cup Final|2000]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_cup/756784.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] | title=Chelsea claim FA Cup glory | date=20 May 2000}}</ref>\n\nDesailly was snapped up by [[Qatar]]i outfit [[Al-Gharafa]] in 2004. He was appointed as the club captain and under the French coach [[Bruno Metsu]] they won the [[Qatar League]] in 2005. He then joined [[Qatar S.C.]], leading them to second place in the league before retiring from professional football.\n\nIn 2014, Desailly had met the [[Football Association of Malaysia]] and said he was ready and willing to coach the [[Malaysia national football team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Sport/Football/2014/02/26/Desailly-eager-to-coach-Malaysia/|title=Desailly eager to coach Malaysia|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=26 February 2014|accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref> He also pointed that it is now up to the football association whether to hire him or not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v7/sp/newssports.php?id=1017711|title=Desailly Ready To Take Up Job of National Coach in Malaysia|publisher=[[Bernama]]|date=26 February 2014|accessdate=27 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226164006/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v7/sp/newssports.php?id=1017711|archivedate=26 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\n\nDesailly has often said that he feels totally French and while having ties with Ghana, never even considered playing for a country other than France. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}} This stance was restated in his autobiography, published in 2002. He made his international debut in 1993, but was not established as a first choice defender until 1996.\n\nHe was an important part of the French team which won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], albeit being sent off in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]]. Like other team members, he was appointed a [[Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] in 1998.<ref name=Legion/>\n\nTwo years later success continued, as France won [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]]. After the tournament, Desailly was made captain of the national team, following the retirement of [[Didier Deschamps]]. In 2001, he led France to victory in the [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup|Confederations Cup]].\n\nIn April 2003, Desailly surpassed the record for the number of appearances for the French team, a number which eventually reached 116 when he announced his retirement from international football following [[UEFA Euro 2004 knockout stage|2004 UEFA European Football Championship]]. However, that record was broken during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] by [[Lilian Thuram]].\n\n==Style of play==\nNicknamed \"The Rock\", due to his consistency, strength, and hard-tackling playing style, Desailly is considered one of the most accomplished players of his generation, and one of the finest French [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] ever, who stood out for his charismatic leadership and ability to organise his team's back-line and break down opposition plays throughout his career. A quick, hard-working, tenacious, and powerful player, who excelled in the air and at anticipating his opponentts, he combined his aggression, stamina, and ability to read the game, as well as his physical, mental, and defensive skills, with a notable confidence and good technique on the ball, which also allowed him to play in the [[Midfielder|midfield]] throughout his career; indeed, after moving to Milan, although he initially started out playing as a centre-back or sweeper, and occasionally even as a [[Full back (association football)|full back]], he was later deployed as a defensive midfielder, a position in which he also excelled, successfully filling the void left by the departure of [[Frank Rijkaard]] due his ball-winning abilities and capacity to start attacking plays after winning back possession. In addition to his defensive skills, he was also capable of contributing to his team's offensive plays with goals by making attacking runs into the box.<ref name=\"The five players Fabio Capello made superstars\"/><ref name=\"All-Star Team of the 1998 World Cup\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/newscentre/news/newsid=71747/index.html|title=MasterCard All-Star Team of the 1998 World Cup|publisher=FIFA|date=10 July 1998|accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/france/squad/744760.stm|title=BBC Sport: Euro 2000 Profile - Marcel Desailly|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/ruud-gullit-perfect-xi#:PzGSoTgQUwmnAA|title=Ruud Gullit: Perfect XI|work=Four Four Two|author1=Hitesh Ratna|date=1 December 2007|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"magliarossonera\">{{cite web|url=http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Desailly.html|title=Marcel DESAILLY (II)|publisher=magliarossonera.it|language=Italian|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref> In 2004, he was named by [[Pel\u00e9]] in the [[FIFA 100]] as one of the world's greatest living players.<ref name=\"Pele\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nMarcel Desailly is currently{{when|date=December 2015}} residing in Ghana.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} He is currently a Laureus Academy member and OrphanAid Africa Lifetime ambassador to Ghana and France (since 2005).

During a successful career at club level, lasting from 1986 to 2006, Desailly won several titles, including [[UEFA Champions League]] medals with both [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] and [[A.C. Milan]], and also played for [[FC Nantes|Nantes]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], among others teams. At international level, he collected 116 caps between 1993 and 2004, scoring 3 goals, and was a member of the [[France national football team|France international squads]] that won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].\n\n==Club career==\nMarcel Desailly was born as Odenke Abbey on 7 September 1968 in [[Accra]], Ghana, the son of Ghanaian parents. He had his name changed when his mother married the head of the French Consulate in Accra, who adopted all of her children (the former professional footballer [[Seth Adonkor]], seven years his elder, was a half-brother of his). The family relocated to France when Desailly was four years old. Following Adonkor's lead, he began his career at [[FC Nantes]]. There, as part of the famed FC Nantes youth programme, he played alongside a young [[Didier Deschamps]], who was a very good central back, who became his closest friend. Desailly turned professional in 1986, two years after his half-brother had died in a car accident. In 1992, he moved to [[Olympique de Marseille]], where he reunited with Deschamps, and won the [[UEFA Champions League]] the following year. In 1994, while playing for [[A.C. Milan]], he again won the Cup (scoring in the [[1994 UEFA Champions League Final|final]] himself), being the first player to win the Cup in consecutive seasons with different clubs. During his time in Milan he won two Italian league titles, in 1994 and 1996. Although he preferred to be deployed as a [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] or [[central defender]], roles which he played during his time in France,<ref name=\"The five players Fabio Capello made superstars\">{{cite news | date=16 December 2007| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/2328637/The-five-players-Fabio-Capello-made-superstars.html | title=The five players Fabio Capello made superstars |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| accessdate=16 December 2007 }}</ref> he found much success playing as a [[Defensive midfielder|defensive midfield]] for Milan, alongside [[Demetrio Albertini]], due to the presence of several other established central defenders at the club, such as [[Franco Baresi]], [[Alessandro Costacurta]] and [[Filippo Galli]].\n\nDesailly then moved to the English club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 1998 for \u00a34.6m,<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-desailly-plans-to-join-lazio-next-summer-1133950.html \"Desailly plans to join Lazio next summer\"]. ''[[The Independent]]''. 21 December 1999.</ref> where he [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the side and played sweeper and centre-back until the end of the [[2003\u201304 FA Premier League|2003\u201304 season]]. It was at Chelsea that Desailly formed a formidable partnership with [[Frank Leboeuf]].\n\nHe picked up one major trophy in his six seasons with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], being on the winning side in their [[FA Cup]] triumph over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in [[2000 FA Cup Final|2000]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_cup/756784.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] | title=Chelsea claim FA Cup glory | date=20 May 2000}}</ref>\n\nDesailly was snapped up by [[Qatar]]i outfit [[Al-Gharafa]] in 2004. He was appointed as the club captain and under the French coach [[Bruno Metsu]] they won the [[Qatar League]] in 2005. He then joined [[Qatar S.C.]], leading them to second place in the league before retiring from professional football.\n\nIn 2014, Desailly had met the [[Football Association of Malaysia]] and said he was ready and willing to coach the [[Malaysia national football team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Sport/Football/2014/02/26/Desailly-eager-to-coach-Malaysia/|title=Desailly eager to coach Malaysia|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=26 February 2014|accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref> He also pointed that it is now up to the football association whether to hire him or not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v7/sp/newssports.php?id=1017711|title=Desailly Ready To Take Up Job of National Coach in Malaysia|publisher=[[Bernama]]|date=26 February 2014|accessdate=27 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226164006/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v7/sp/newssports.php?id=1017711|archivedate=26 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\n\nDesailly has often said that he feels totally French and while having ties with Ghana, never even considered playing for a country other than France. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}} This stance was restated in his autobiography, published in 2002. He made his international debut in 1993, but was not established as a first choice defender until 1996.\n\nHe was an important part of the French team which won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], albeit being sent off in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]]. Like other team members, he was appointed a [[Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] in 1998.<ref name=Legion/>\n\nTwo years later success continued, as France won [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]]. After the tournament, Desailly was made captain of the national team, following the retirement of [[Didier Deschamps]]. In 2001, he led France to victory in the [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup|Confederations Cup]].\n\nIn April 2003, Desailly surpassed the record for the number of appearances for the French team, a number which eventually reached 116 when he announced his retirement from international football following [[UEFA Euro 2004 knockout stage|2004 UEFA European Football Championship]]. However, that record was broken during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] by [[Lilian Thuram]].\n\n==Style of play==\nNicknamed \"The Rock\", due to his consistency, strength, and hard-tackling playing style, Desailly is considered one of the most accomplished players of his generation, and one of the finest French [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] ever, who stood out for his charismatic leadership and ability to organise his team's back-line and break down opposition plays throughout his career. A quick, hard-working, tenacious, and powerful player, who excelled in the air and at anticipating his opponentts, he combined his aggression, stamina, and ability to read the game, as well as his physical, mental, and defensive skills, with a notable confidence and good technique on the ball, which also allowed him to play in the [[Midfielder|midfield]] throughout his career; indeed, after moving to Milan, although he initially started out playing as a centre-back or sweeper, and occasionally even as a [[Full back (association football)|full back]], he was later deployed as a defensive midfielder, a position in which he also excelled, successfully filling the void left by the departure of [[Frank Rijkaard]] due his ball-winning abilities and capacity to start attacking plays after winning back possession. In addition to his defensive skills, he was also capable of contributing to his team's offensive plays with goals by making attacking runs into the box.<ref name=\"The five players Fabio Capello made superstars\"/><ref name=\"All-Star Team of the 1998 World Cup\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/newscentre/news/newsid=71747/index.html|title=MasterCard All-Star Team of the 1998 World Cup|publisher=FIFA|date=10 July 1998|accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/france/squad/744760.stm|title=BBC Sport: Euro 2000 Profile - Marcel Desailly|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/ruud-gullit-perfect-xi#:PzGSoTgQUwmnAA|title=Ruud Gullit: Perfect XI|work=Four Four Two|author1=Hitesh Ratna|date=1 December 2007|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"magliarossonera\">{{cite web|url=http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Desailly.html|title=Marcel DESAILLY (II)|publisher=magliarossonera.it|language=Italian|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref> In 2004, he was named by [[Pel\u00e9]] in the [[FIFA 100]] as one of the world's greatest living players.<ref name=\"Pele\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nMarcel Desailly is currently{{when|date=December 2015}} residing in Ghana.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} He is currently a Laureus Academy member and OrphanAid Africa Lifetime ambassador to Ghana and France (since 2005).
