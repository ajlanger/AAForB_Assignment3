It was the fourth of eight expositions held in the city between 1855 and 1937. It attracted more than thirty-two million visitors. The most famous structure created for the Exposition, and still remaining, is the [[Eiffel Tower]].\n\n== Organization == \nThe Exposition was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[Storming of the Bastille]], which marked the beginning of [[French Revolution]], and was also seen a way to stimulate the economy and pull France out of an economic recession. <ref>''L'Exposition de 1889 et la tour Eiffel, d'apr\u00e8s les documents officiels. 1889''. pp. 165-166</ref>  The Exposition attracted 61,722 official exhibitors, of whom twenty-five thousand were from outside of France. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}\n\n== Admission price ==\nAdmission to the Exposition cost forty centimes, at a time when the price of a \"economy\" plate of meat and vegetables in a Paris cafe was ten centimes.  Visitors paid an additional price for several of the Exposition's most popular attractions.  Climbing the Eiffel Tower cost five Francs; admission to the popular panoramas, theatres and concerts was one franc. Visitors from the French provinces could buy a ticket which included the train fare and entry into the Exposition. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}  The total cost of Exposition was 41,500,000 Francs, while income was 49,500,000 Francs. It was the last of the Paris Universal Expositions to make a profit. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}\n\n== National Participation and boycotts ==\nThe countries which officially participated in the Exposition were Andorra, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican  Republic, Ecuador, the United States, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hawaii, Honduras, Japan, Moroco, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Norway, Paraguay, Persia,  Saint-Martin, El Salvador, Serbia, Siam, the Republic of South Africa, Switzerland, and Uruguay, The British dominions of New Zealand and Tasmania also took part.\n\nBecause of the theme of the Exposition, celebrating the overthrow of the French monarchy, nearly all European countries with monarchies officially boycotted the Exposition.  The boycotting nations were Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Spain, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden.<ref>Schroeder-Gudehus, Brigitte, ''Les grandes puissances devant l\u2019Exposition universelle de 1889'', ''Le Mouvement social'' number 149, 1989, pg. 15 (in French)</ref>\n\nNonetheless, many citizens and companies from these countries did participate, and a number of countries had their participation entirely funded by private sponsors. These included Germany and Alsace-Lorraine, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil. China, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, Britain and its colonies, Haiti, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Finland and Sweden.<ref>Schroeder-Gudehus, Brigitte,''Les grandes puissances devant l\u2019Exposition universelle de 1889'', (in French), ''Le Mouvement Social'', number 149, 1989, page 15</ref>\n\n== Exposition Sites ==\n[[File:Plan g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Exposition Universelle de 1889.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Plan of the 1889 Exposition]].\n\nThe Exposition occupied two large sites.  The main site was on [[Champs de Mars]] on the Left Bank, which had been the parade ground of the [[Ecole Militaire]], and had been occupied by the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Universal Exposition]].  This was the site of the major part of the Exposition, including the Eiffel Tower, Palace of Machines, and the Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts.  The Exposition extended across the Seine to the right bank, to the [[Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro|Trocadero Palace]], which had been built on the heights for the 1878 Exposition.  The slope from the Trocadero Palace down to the Seine was filled with terrace, fountains, gardens and horticultural exhibits. \n\nA separate, smaller site was located esplanade of [[Les Invalides]], which hosted the pavilions of the French colonies. This section featured a  large assortment of outdoor restaurants and cafes, with foods from Indochina, North Africa, and other cuisines from around the world. This was linked to the Champs de Mars site by a corridor of pavilions along the left Bank.  This corridor, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, also featured a display called \"The History of Human Habitation\", with model houses depicting the history of domestic architecture, designed with much imagination by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], architect of the [[Paris Opera]].\n\nThere were twenty-two different entrances to the Exposition, around its perimeter.  They were open from 8 a.m. until 6:00 p,m. for the major exhibits and palaces, and until 11:00 in the evening for the illuminated greens and restaurants.  The major ceremonial entrance was located at Les Invalides consisting of two tall pylons with colorful ornament, like giant candelabras.<ref>Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay catalog (11989) pg. 105 </ref>\n\n== Views of the Exposition ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537199 (3784839428).jpg|The main entrance of the Exposition \nFile:CLC 528 - PARIS - Galerie des Machines.JPG|Postcard of trams stopping at the [[Galerie des Machines]], at the edge of the Exposition\nFile:Tour Eiffel 3b40739.jpg|Exposition seen from a balloon (1889) \nFile:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Paris Exposition, view from ground level of the Eiffel tower with Parisians promenading, 1889.jpg|View under the Eiffel Tower toward the Central Dome\nFile:La Tour Eiffel from North of the Trocadero, 1889 - Flickr 14382709664.jpg|View of Exposition from Trocadero\nFile:Street view, looking toward Palais des Invalides, showing pavilions on L'Esplanade des Invalides, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilions on the Esplanade des Invalides, with [[Les Invalides]] in the background\nFile:Exposition Universal 1889 Paris France.jpg|View of the Central Dome\n</gallery>\n\n== Structures ==\n=== The Eiffel Tower ===\nThe [[Eiffel Tower]], built especially for the Exposition, was the tallest structure in the world at the time. A competition to build what was simply called  \"A tower of three hundred meters\" with a base one hundred meters wide, was announced in 1886. It  was won by the construction firm of [[Gustave Eiffel]], which had recently built the iron frame of the [[Statue of Liberty]].  The Eiffel firm had advance knowledge of the project and, beginning in 1884,  had already designed a tower exactly to those dimensions.  The structural design was created by two Eiffel engineers, Maurice Koechlin and \u00c9mile Nouguier, who along with Eiffel himself, received the patent for the plan. An Eiffel architect, Stephen Sauvestre, designed the curving form and decoration which gave the tower its distinctive appearance.  Eiffel was granted exclusive rights for twenty years to operate the tower and its restaurants and viewing platforms.  A site next to the River was chosen, despite the infiltration of river water, since that land was owned by the City of Paris, and the tower could be kept in place after the Exposition was completed. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}}\n\nThe construction lasted two years, two months and five days, and involved five hundred workers, who assembled eighteen thousand iron pieces, each of five meters and carefully numbered, which had been made at a factory in [[Levallois-Perret]], a Paris suburb. Speaking of the tower construction workers, the son-in-law of Eiffel, declared,  \"no soldier on the battle field deserved better mention than these humble toilers, who, will never go down in history.\"  During the Exposition, No one other than construction personnel were allowed higher than the second viewing platform.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/>\n\nIn the first week of the Exposition, 29,922 persons climbed the tower to the viewing platform,  though the elevators were not yet in service, and they had to climb by a narrow winding stairway.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06E4DE1030E633A2575AC1A9639C94689FD7CF|title=The Great French Show|date=1889-05-19|work=The New York Times|pages=Front Page|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> By the time the Exposition finished, after 173 days, 1,968,287 persons had ascended the tower. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}} \n\nWhen the Exposition ended, the tower was used for a time as a weather station. In 1904, Eiffel proposed to the French military that a radio transmitter, designed by the pioneer radio engineer [[Edouard Branly]], be placed on the third level. In 1909, when Eiffel's concession formally ended, it was decided to preserve the Tower permanently. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Construction tour eiffel5.JPG|The tower under construction a year before the opening  (1888)\nFile:Les escaliers de la Tour Eiffel, au-dessus de la deuxi\u00e8me plate-forme, 1889.jpg|Stairway to the viewing level\nFile:Gustave Eiffel posant au sommet de la tour.jpg|[[Gustave Eiffel]] (left) posing on the stairway of his tower\nFile:Eiffel-Otis lift-poyet.jpg|The Otis elevators that carried visitors up the north and south legs of the tower\nFile:View of Exposition Universelle from Eiffel Tower, Paris, 1889.jpg|View of the Seine and the Exposition from the Eiffel Tower\nFile:Georges Garen embrasement tour Eiffel.jpg|Chromolithograph by George Garen of the Eiffel Tower illuminations (1889)\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Gallery of Machines ===\nA second monumental building on the site was the [[Galerie des machines]], by the architect [[Ferdinand Dutert]] and engineer [[Victor Contamin]], which had originally been built for the [[Universal Exposition of 1878]]. It was a huge iron and glass structure  which contained the industrial displays. It occupied the entire width of the Exposition site, the land  between the avenue de la Bourdonnais and the present avenue de Suffren, and covered 77,000 square meters, with 34,700 meters of glass windows.  At 111 meters, the Galerie covered the longest interior space in the world at the time, It cost 7,430,000 Francs, or seven times the cost of the Eiffel Tower. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=81}}   It was later used again at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle of 1900]] and then destroyed in 1910.  \n\nThe Galerie of Machines used a system of hinged arches (like a series of bridge spans placed not end-to-end but parallel) made of steel or iron. Although often described as being constructed of steel, it was actually made of iron.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Studies in the History of Civil Engineering|author= Stamper, John W.|volume=10|editor=  |year=2000|quote=The principal material of the building\u2019s structure was to have been steel, but the decision was made at the last minute to use iron instead. William Watson, an American engineer who wrote a thorough report on the fair after it closed states that the idea of using steel was abandoned \"on the two-fold ground of expense and the necessity of hastening the execution of work. \" The price of iron was about two-thirds that of steel in 1889.}}</ref><ref> There is an extensive description, with illustrations, of the Exposition's two famous buildings in the British journal ''Engineering'' (3 May 1889 issue). A follow-up report appears a late issue with this summation:</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Engineering|date=14 June 1889|title=The File:Le Palais des arts lib\u00e9raux, Vue en perspective de l'ensemble des galeries.jpgParis Exhibition|page=677 }}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Interior of exhibition building, Exposition Universal, Paris, France.jpg|Interior of the Galerie des machines (1889) \nFile:Central Dome of the Gallery des Machines Exposition Universelle de Paris 1889 by Louis Beroud 1852 1930.jpg|Interior of the central dome of the Gallerie des machines, by [[Louis B\u00e9roud]] (1889)\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Science and technology===\nOne important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology. [[Thomas Edison]] visited the Exposition to visit a pavilion devoted to his recent inventions, including an improved phonograph clearer better sound quality. \n\nAnother new technology that was promoted at the Exposition was the safety elevator, developed by a new American company, [[Otis Elevator]]. Otis built the elevators carrying passengers up the legs of the Eiffel Tower to the first level. When journalists expressed concern about the safety of the elevators, Otis technicians filled one elevator with three thousand kilograms of lead, simulating passengers, and then, with journalists from around the world watching, cut the cable with an axe.  The elevator's fall was halted ten feet above the ground by the Otis safety brakes.\n\nThere were pavilions especially devoted to the telephone and to electricity, and others devoted to maritime navigation, and another, the Palais de Guerre or Palace of War, to developments in military technology, such as naval artillery.  \n\nPrefabricated metal housing was another technology that appeared at the Exposition.  Gustave Eiffel developed a series of houses with roof and walls of galvanised steel,  and wooden interiors, which could be rapidly put together or taken apart, largely for use in French colony of Indochina.   Some of them served as ticket booths at the 1889 Exposition; one of these old booths, now used as a shelter for hikers,  can now be found in the Forest of [[Dampierre-en-Yvelines|Dampierre]]. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=98-99}} \n\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Le phonographe Edison, \u00e0 la section des \u00c9tats-Unis.jpg|Edison [[phonograph]] demonstrated at the Exposition \nFile:La Tour Eiffel.

Both were designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]] with a similar plan. Both buildings had modern iron frames abundance of glass, but were completely covered with colorful ceramic tiles and sculpted decoration. \n\nThe Exposition  included a building by the Paris architect [[Pierre-Henri Picq]].  This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine-Egyptian-Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to [[Fort de France]] and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Schoelcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that [[Victor Schoelcher]] had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in [[Martinique]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Les charpentes des Palais des beaux-arts et des arts lib\u00e9raux au Champ-de-Mars.jpg|The Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts under construction, both designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]]\nFile:Gezicht in tentoonstellingszaal van de Wereldtentoonstelling van 1889 in Parijs Exposition Universelle de 1889 (titel op object), RP-F-F16653.jpg|Interior of the Palace of Fine Arts by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]]\nFile:Exposition Universal, 1900, Paris, France-LCCN2001698574.jpg|The Palace of Fine Arts\nFile:Le Palais des arts lib\u00e9raux, Vue en perspective de l'ensemble des galeries.jpg|Inerior of the Palace of Liberal Arts\nFile:Interior of Paris Exposition building showing two balloons LCCN2002717992.tif|Interior of the Palace of Liberal Arts, with balloons\n</gallery>\n\n===Fountains===\nThe Exposition featured numerous fountains and reflecting pools, particularly in the mall that ran between the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Machines. The largest fountain, near the Eiffel Tower, was entitled \"The City of Paris enlightens the world with its torch.\"  The fountain was designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]], who designed the nearby Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts.  The other major fountain, not far away, was \"The Five Parts of the World\", illustrating the continents.  It was designed by Francis de Saint-Vidal.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Fountain Coutan and the Central Dome, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|The Coutan Fountain and central dome \n</gallery>\n\n=== The \"Street of Cairo\" and exotic habitations===\nThe Rue de Caire (\"Street of Cairo\") was a popular attraction designed to recreate the architecture and street life of [[Cairo]].  It provided a striking contrast to the very modern Palace of Machines, next to it.  It was the idea of Baron Delort Gl\u00e9on, an art collector and specialist in Egyptian art, with financial support from Charles De Lesseps, the head of the Egyptian committee for the Exposition, and son of Ferdinand De Lesseps, the builder of the [[Suez Canal]].  It was a winding street, with buildings at odd angles, and featured, among other buildings,  a minaret, two mosques, a school and two ornamental gateways. The doors, windows, and architectural fittings and decoration were real, imported from demolished buildings in Cairo.  The street was populated by real Egyptians in costumes, including musicians, belly dancers, artists, craftsmen, and vendors of various Egyptian foods and delicacies.\n\nThe Exposition featured several other examples of picturesque habitations and villages from around the world, including a Javanese village and recreated houses of villages from Senegal, Benin, and other colonies, with costumed residents. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:La rue du Caire.

The Latin American nations had particularly colorful and lavish structures. \n\nThe Pavilion of Argentina was one of the largest and most decorative pavilions in the Exposition. It was designed by the French architect [[Albert Ballu]], who won the 1887 design competition. It covered 1600 square meters, and was fifty meters high, topped by five iron and glass cupolas and surrounded by a frieze of mosaics, ceramics and coloured glass ornaments.  After the Exposition closed, it was taken apart and shipped to [[Buenos Aires]], where it stood until it was dismantled in 1952. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989) page 261}} \n\n\nIn addition to the nations, there were pavilions of specialized industries, such as the Suez Canal company, the pavilion of the Transatlantic steamship company, the telephone and electrify pavilions, and the Pavilions of gas and oil. \nThe Palace of Food Products was a very large and ornate structure, presenting French food and wine products.  One of its highlights was an enormous sculpted wooden barrel from [[Champagne Mercier]] that could hold two thousand bottles of  champagne, {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989) page 261}}\n \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Pabellon-argentino plazasmartin 1900.jpg|The Pavilion of Argentina, winner of the contest for best national pavilion\nFile:Pabell\u00f3n chileno en la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds de 1889-cropped.jpg|Pavilion of Chile\nFile:Pavilion of Brazil, Paris Exposition, 1889 LCCN92520980.jpg|Pavilion of Brazil \nFile:Paris Exposition train 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Algeria, with the Exposition train \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537046 (3784010239).jpg|Pavilion of Persia \nFile:Pavilion of India, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of India \nFile:Pavilion of Siam, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Siam \nFile:Palais du Mexican, Paris Exposition, 1889 (14382646444).jpg|Pavilion of Mexico\nFile:Pavilion of Nicaragua and base of the Eiffel Tower, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Nicaragua\nFile:\u00a8Pavillon des \u00eeles Hawa\u00ef - Exposition universelle Paris 1889.jpg|Paviiion of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] \nFile:Pavilion of the Suez Canal Company, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of the Suez Canal Company, in Egyptian style\nFile:Le palais des produits alimentaires, Exposition universelle 1889.jpg|The Palace of Food Products\nFile:Epernay fass mercier side view.jpg|A gigantic oak barrel with a capacity of 200 000 bottles of champagne was a feature of the [[Champagne Mercier]] exhibit at the food and wine pavilion. \n</gallery>\n\n=== Charles Garnier's ''History of Habitation'' ===\nAn unusual display was the \"History of Habitation\" designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], the architect of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera House]] named for him. He was then sixty-one, and had designed very few other major projects since the Opera.  He had also signed a petition, along with other prominent writers and artists, denouncing the Eiffel Tower as an atrocity. Despite this, he agreed to design a series of houses to illustrate the history of human habitation.  These houses, separated by gardens, were placed close to the Eiffel Tower on a narrow strip of land along Quai D'Orsay and the banks of the Seine. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, Catalog of Exposition (1989), pg. 132-135}}\n\nThe houses were arranged by century and by continent, beginning with Garnier's idea of prehistoric dwellings and huts, through the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and other early civilizations, through the Middle Ages and Renaissance to the modern then houses from Japan, and China and the homes of Eskimos, and dwellings from Africa, Japan, China and Lapland, and dwellings of Native Americans, Aztecs and Incas.  These dwellings were designed by Garnier with more imagination than strict historic accuracy, but they were picturesque and very popular.  The Roman House had a special function, as the residence of the President of France when he visited the Exposition. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, Catalog of Exposition (1989), pg. 132-135}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 \"Casa egipcia\" (3784820432).jpg|The Egyptian House of the History of Habitation, by Charles Garnier \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537073 (3784014313).jpg|The Aztec House and Incan House by Charles Garnier \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537049 (3784820368).jpg|The Roman House and the Gallo-Roman House, by Charles Garnier\n\n</gallery>\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nMany smaller but picturesque buildings were included within or adjacent to the Exposition.  The architect [[Hector Guimard]], then just twenty-two years old, built his first two buildings for the Exposition; The cafe-restaurant Au Grand Neptune at 148 Quai Louis-Bleriot (Paris 16th arrondissement), and a small Pavillon of Electricity for an electrician named Ferdinand de Boy\u00e9res, located just outside the Exposition site at avenue de Suffren.  The Pavilion of electricity was demolished immediately after the Exposition, and the cafe was torn down in 1910.\n\n{{quote|the exhibition will be famous for four distinctive features.  In the first place, for its buildings, especially the Eiffel tower and the Machinery Hall; in the second place, for its Colonial Exhibition, which for the first time brings vividly to the appreciation of the Frenchmen that they are masters of lands beyond the sea; thirdly, it will be remembered for its great collection of war material, the most absorbing subject now-a-days, unfortunately, to governments if not to individuals; and fourthly, it will be remembered, and with good cause by many, for the extraordinary manner in which South American countries are represented.}}\n\n==Science and technology==\nOne important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology.

It attracted more than thirty-two million visitors. The most famous structure created for the Exposition, and still remaining, is the [[Eiffel Tower]].  \n\n== Organization == \nThe Exposition was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[Storming of the Bastille]], which marked the beginning of [[French Revolution]], and was also seen a way to stimulate the economy and pull France out of an economic recession. <ref>''L'Exposition de 1889 et la tour Eiffel, d'apr\u00e8s les documents officiels. 1889''. pp. 165-166</ref>  The Exposition attracted 61,722 official exhibitors, of whom twenty-five thousand were from outside of France. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}\n\n== Admission price ==\nAdmission to the Exposition cost forty centimes, at a time when the price of a \"economy\" plate of meat and vegetables in a Paris cafe was ten centimes.  Visitors paid an additional price for several of the Exposition's most popular attractions.  Climbing the Eiffel Tower cost five Francs; admission to the popular panoramas, theatres and concerts was one franc. Visitors from the French provinces could buy a ticket which included the train fare and entry into the Exposition. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}  The total cost of Exposition was 41,500,000 Francs, while income was 49,500,000 Francs. It was the last of the Paris Universal Expositions to make a profit. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}\n\n== National Participation and boycotts ==\nThe countries which officially participated in the Exposition were Andorra, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican  Republic, Ecuador, the United States, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hawaii, Honduras, Japan, Moroco, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Norway, Paraguay, Persia,  Saint-Martin, El Salvador, Serbia, Siam, the Republic of South Africa, Switzerland, and Uruguay, The British dominions of New Zealand and Tasmania also took part.\n\nBecause of the theme of the Exposition, celebrating the overthrow of the French monarchy, nearly all European countries with monarchies officially boycotted the Exposition.  The boycotting nations were Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Spain, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden.<ref>Schroeder-Gudehus, Brigitte, ''Les grandes puissances devant l\u2019Exposition universelle de 1889'', ''Le Mouvement social'' number 149, 1989, pg. 15 (in French)</ref>\n\nNonetheless, many citizens and companies from these countries did participate, and a number of countries had their participation entirely funded by private sponsors. These included Germany and Alsace-Lorraine, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil. China, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, Britain and its colonies, Haiti, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Finland and Sweden.<ref>Schroeder-Gudehus, Brigitte,''Les grandes puissances devant l\u2019Exposition universelle de 1889'', (in French), ''Le Mouvement Social'', number 149, 1989, page 15</ref>\n\n== Exposition Sites ==\n[[File:Plan g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Exposition Universelle de 1889.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Plan of the 1889 Exposition]].\n\nThe Exposition occupied two large sites.  The main site was on [[Champs de Mars]] on the Left Bank, which had been the parade ground of the [[Ecole Militaire]], and had been occupied by the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Universal Exposition]].  This was the site of the major part of the Exposition, including the Eiffel Tower, Palace of Machines, and the Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts.  The Exposition extended across the Seine to the right bank, to the [[Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro|Trocadero Palace]], which had been built on the heights for the 1878 Exposition.  The slope from the Trocadero Palace down to the Seine was filled with terrace, fountains, gardens and horticultural exhibits. \n\nA separate, smaller site was located esplanade of [[Les Invalides]], which hosted the pavilions of the French colonies. This section featured a  large assortment of outdoor restaurants and cafes, with foods from Indochina, North Africa, and other cuisines from around the world. This was linked to the Champs de Mars site by a corridor of pavilions along the left Bank.  This corridor, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, also featured a display called \"The History of Human Habitation\", with model houses depicting the history of domestic architecture, designed with much imagination by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], architect of the [[Paris Opera]].\n\nThere were twenty-two different entrances to the Exposition, around its perimeter.  They were open from 8 a.m. until 6:00 p,m. for the major exhibits and palaces, and until 11:00 in the evening for the illuminated greens and restaurants.  The major ceremonial entrance was located at Les Invalides consisting of two tall pylons with colorful ornament, like giant candelabras.<ref>Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay catalog (11989) pg. 105 </ref>\n\n== Views of the Exposition ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537199 (3784839428).jpg|The main entrance of the Exposition \nFile:CLC 528 - PARIS - Galerie des Machines.JPG|Postcard of trams stopping at the [[Galerie des Machines]], at the edge of the Exposition\nFile:Tour Eiffel 3b40739.jpg|Exposition seen from a balloon (1889) \nFile:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Paris Exposition, view from ground level of the Eiffel tower with Parisians promenading, 1889.jpg|View under the Eiffel Tower toward the Central Dome\nFile:La Tour Eiffel from North of the Trocadero, 1889 - Flickr 14382709664.jpg|View of Exposition from Trocadero\nFile:Street view, looking toward Palais des Invalides, showing pavilions on L'Esplanade des Invalides, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilions on the Esplanade des Invalides, with [[Les Invalides]] in the background\nFile:Exposition Universal 1889 Paris France.jpg|View of the Central Dome\n</gallery>\n\n== Structures ==\n=== The Eiffel Tower ===\nThe [[Eiffel Tower]], built especially for the Exposition, was the tallest structure in the world at the time. A competition to build what was simply called  \"A tower of three hundred meters\" with a base one hundred meters wide, was announced in 1886. It  was won by the construction firm of [[Gustave Eiffel]], which had recently built the iron frame of the [[Statue of Liberty]].  The Eiffel firm had advance knowledge of the project and, beginning in 1884,  had already designed a tower exactly to those dimensions.  The structural design was created by two Eiffel engineers, Maurice Koechlin and \u00c9mile Nouguier, who along with Eiffel himself, received the patent for the plan. An Eiffel architect, Stephen Sauvestre, designed the curving form and decoration which gave the tower its distinctive appearance.  Eiffel was granted exclusive rights for twenty years to operate the tower and its restaurants and viewing platforms.  A site next to the River was chosen, despite the infiltration of river water, since that land was owned by the City of Paris, and the tower could be kept in place after the Exposition was completed. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}}\n\nThe construction lasted two years, two months and five days, and involved five hundred workers, who assembled eighteen thousand iron pieces, each of five meters and carefully numbered, which had been made at a factory in [[Levallois-Perret]], a Paris suburb. Speaking of the tower construction workers, the son-in-law of Eiffel, declared,  \"no soldier on the battle field deserved better mention than these humble toilers, who, will never go down in history.\"  During the Exposition, No one other than construction personnel were allowed higher than the second viewing platform.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/>\n\nIn the first week of the Exposition, 29,922 persons climbed the tower to the viewing platform,  though the elevators were not yet in service, and they had to climb by a narrow winding stairway.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06E4DE1030E633A2575AC1A9639C94689FD7CF|title=The Great French Show|date=1889-05-19|work=The New York Times|pages=Front Page|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> By the time the Exposition finished, after 173 days, 1,968,287 persons had ascended the tower. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}} \n\nWhen the Exposition ended, the tower was used for a time as a weather station. In 1904, Eiffel proposed to the French military that a radio transmitter, designed by the pioneer radio engineer [[Edouard Branly]], be placed on the third level. In 1909, when Eiffel's concession formally ended, it was decided to preserve the Tower permanently. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Construction tour eiffel5.JPG|The tower under construction a year before the opening  (1888)\nFile:Les escaliers de la Tour Eiffel, au-dessus de la deuxi\u00e8me plate-forme, 1889.jpg|Stairway to the viewing level\nFile:Gustave Eiffel posant au sommet de la tour.jpg|[[Gustave Eiffel]] (left) posing on the stairway of his tower\nFile:Eiffel-Otis lift-poyet.jpg|The Otis elevators that carried visitors up the north and south legs of the tower\nFile:View of Exposition Universelle from Eiffel Tower, Paris, 1889.jpg|View of the Seine and the Exposition from the Eiffel Tower\nFile:Georges Garen embrasement tour Eiffel.jpg|Chromolithograph by George Garen of the Eiffel Tower illuminations (1889)\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Gallery of Machines ===\nA second monumental building on the site was the [[Galerie des machines]], by the architect [[Ferdinand Dutert]] and engineer [[Victor Contamin]], which had originally been built for the [[Universal Exposition of 1878]]. It was a huge iron and glass structure  which contained the industrial displays. It occupied the entire width of the Exposition site, the land  between the avenue de la Bourdonnais and the present avenue de Suffren, and covered 77,000 square meters, with 34,700 meters of glass windows.  At 111 meters, the Galerie covered the longest interior space in the world at the time, It cost 7,430,000 Francs, or seven times the cost of the Eiffel Tower. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=81}}   It was later used again at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle of 1900]] and then destroyed in 1910.  \n\nThe Galerie of Machines used a system of hinged arches (like a series of bridge spans placed not end-to-end but parallel) made of steel or iron. Although often described as being constructed of steel, it was actually made of iron.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Studies in the History of Civil Engineering|author= Stamper, John W.|volume=10|editor=  |year=2000|quote=The principal material of the building\u2019s structure was to have been steel, but the decision was made at the last minute to use iron instead. William Watson, an American engineer who wrote a thorough report on the fair after it closed states that the idea of using steel was abandoned \"on the two-fold ground of expense and the necessity of hastening the execution of work. \" The price of iron was about two-thirds that of steel in 1889.}}</ref><ref> There is an extensive description, with illustrations, of the Exposition's two famous buildings in the British journal ''Engineering'' (3 May 1889 issue). A follow-up report appears a late issue with this summation:</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Engineering|date=14 June 1889|title=The File:Le Palais des arts lib\u00e9raux, Vue en perspective de l'ensemble des galeries.jpgParis Exhibition|page=677 }}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Interior of exhibition building, Exposition Universal, Paris, France.jpg|Interior of the Galerie des machines (1889) \nFile:Central Dome of the Gallery des Machines Exposition Universelle de Paris 1889 by Louis Beroud 1852 1930.jpg|Interior of the central dome of the Gallerie des machines, by [[Louis B\u00e9roud]] (1889)\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Science and technology===\nOne important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology. [[Thomas Edison]] visited the Exposition to visit a pavilion devoted to his recent inventions, including an improved phonograph clearer better sound quality. \n\nAnother new technology that was promoted at the Exposition was the safety elevator, developed by a new American company, [[Otis Elevator]]. Otis built the elevators carrying passengers up the legs of the Eiffel Tower to the first level. When journalists expressed concern about the safety of the elevators, Otis technicians filled one elevator with three thousand kilograms of lead, simulating passengers, and then, with journalists from around the world watching, cut the cable with an axe.  The elevator's fall was halted ten feet above the ground by the Otis safety brakes.\n\nThere were pavilions especially devoted to the telephone and to electricity, and others devoted to maritime navigation, and another, the Palais de Guerre or Palace of War, to developments in military technology, such as naval artillery.  \n\nPrefabricated metal housing was another technology that appeared at the Exposition.  Gustave Eiffel developed a series of houses with roof and walls of galvanised steel,  and wooden interiors, which could be rapidly put together or taken apart, largely for use in French colony of Indochina.   Some of them served as ticket booths at the 1889 Exposition; one of these old booths, now used as a shelter for hikers,  can now be found in the Forest of [[Dampierre-en-Yvelines|Dampierre]]. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=98-99}} \n\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Le phonographe Edison, \u00e0 la section des \u00c9tats-Unis.jpg|Edison [[phonograph]] demonstrated at the Exposition \nFile:La Tour Eiffel.

Both were designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]] with a similar plan. Both buildings had modern iron frames abundance of glass, but were completely covered with colorful ceramic tiles and sculpted decoration. \n\nThe Exposition  included a building by the Paris architect [[Pierre-Henri Picq]].  This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine-Egyptian-Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to [[Fort de France]] and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Schoelcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that [[Victor Schoelcher]] had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in [[Martinique]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Les charpentes des Palais des beaux-arts et des arts lib\u00e9raux au Champ-de-Mars.jpg|The Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts under construction, both designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]]\nFile:Gezicht in tentoonstellingszaal van de Wereldtentoonstelling van 1889 in Parijs Exposition Universelle de 1889 (titel op object), RP-F-F16653.jpg|Interior of the Palace of Fine Arts by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]]\nFile:Exposition Universal, 1900, Paris, France-LCCN2001698574.jpg|The Palace of Fine Arts\nFile:Le Palais des arts lib\u00e9raux, Vue en perspective de l'ensemble des galeries.jpg|Inerior of the Palace of Liberal Arts\nFile:Interior of Paris Exposition building showing two balloons LCCN2002717992.tif|Interior of the Palace of Liberal Arts, with balloons\n</gallery>\n\n===Fountains===\nThe Exposition featured numerous fountains and reflecting pools, particularly in the mall that ran between the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Machines. The largest fountain, near the Eiffel Tower, was entitled \"The City of Paris enlightens the world with its torch.\"  The fountain was designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]], who designed the nearby Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts.  The other major fountain, not far away, was \"The Five Parts of the World\", illustrating the continents.  It was designed by Francis de Saint-Vidal.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Fountain Coutan and the Central Dome, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|The Coutan Fountain and central dome \n</gallery>\n\n=== The \"Street of Cairo\" and exotic habitations===\nThe Rue de Caire (\"Street of Cairo\") was a popular attraction designed to recreate the architecture and street life of [[Cairo]].  It provided a striking contrast to the very modern Palace of Machines, next to it.  It was the idea of Baron Delort Gl\u00e9on, an art collector and specialist in Egyptian art, with financial support from Charles De Lesseps, the head of the Egyptian committee for the Exposition, and son of Ferdinand De Lesseps, the builder of the [[Suez Canal]].  It was a winding street, with buildings at odd angles, and featured, among other buildings,  a minaret, two mosques, a school and two ornamental gateways. The doors, windows, and architectural fittings and decoration were real, imported from demolished buildings in Cairo.  The street was populated by real Egyptians in costumes, including musicians, belly dancers, artists, craftsmen, and vendors of various Egyptian foods and delicacies.\n\nThe Exposition featured several other examples of picturesque habitations and villages from around the world, including a Javanese village and recreated houses of villages from Senegal, Benin, and other colonies, with costumed residents. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:La rue du Caire.

The Latin American nations had particularly colorful and lavish structures. \n\nThe Pavilion of Argentina was one of the largest and most decorative pavilions in the Exposition. It was designed by the French architect [[Albert Ballu]], who won the 1887 design competition. It covered 1600 square meters, and was fifty meters high, topped by five iron and glass cupolas and surrounded by a frieze of mosaics, ceramics and coloured glass ornaments.  After the Exposition closed, it was taken apart and shipped to [[Buenos Aires]], where it stood until it was dismantled in 1952. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989) page 261}} \n\n\nIn addition to the nations, there were pavilions of specialized industries, such as the Suez Canal company, the pavilion of the Transatlantic steamship company, the telephone and electrify pavilions, and the Pavilions of gas and oil. \nThe Palace of Food Products was a very large and ornate structure, presenting French food and wine products.  One of its highlights was an enormous sculpted wooden barrel from [[Champagne Mercier]] that could hold two thousand bottles of  champagne, {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989) page 261}}\n \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Pabellon-argentino plazasmartin 1900.jpg|The Pavilion of Argentina, winner of the contest for best national pavilion\nFile:Pabell\u00f3n chileno en la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds de 1889-cropped.jpg|Pavilion of Chile\nFile:Pavilion of Brazil, Paris Exposition, 1889 LCCN92520980.jpg|Pavilion of Brazil \nFile:Paris Exposition train 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Algeria, with the Exposition train \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537046 (3784010239).jpg|Pavilion of Persia \nFile:Pavilion of India, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of India \nFile:Pavilion of Siam, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Siam \nFile:Palais du Mexican, Paris Exposition, 1889 (14382646444).jpg|Pavilion of Mexico\nFile:Pavilion of Nicaragua and base of the Eiffel Tower, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Nicaragua\nFile:\u00a8Pavillon des \u00eeles Hawa\u00ef - Exposition universelle Paris 1889.jpg|Paviiion of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] \nFile:Pavilion of the Suez Canal Company, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of the Suez Canal Company, in Egyptian style\nFile:Le palais des produits alimentaires, Exposition universelle 1889.jpg|The Palace of Food Products\nFile:Epernay fass mercier side view.jpg|A gigantic oak barrel with a capacity of 200 000 bottles of champagne was a feature of the [[Champagne Mercier]] exhibit at the food and wine pavilion. \n</gallery>\n\n=== Charles Garnier's ''History of Habitation'' ===\nAn unusual display was the \"History of Habitation\" designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], the architect of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera House]] named for him. He was then sixty-one, and had designed very few other major projects since the Opera.  He had also signed a petition, along with other prominent writers and artists, denouncing the Eiffel Tower as an atrocity. Despite this, he agreed to design a series of houses to illustrate the history of human habitation.  These houses, separated by gardens, were placed close to the Eiffel Tower on a narrow strip of land along Quai D'Orsay and the banks of the Seine. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, Catalog of Exposition (1989), pg. 132-135}}\n\nThe houses were arranged by century and by continent, beginning with Garnier's idea of prehistoric dwellings and huts, through the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and other early civilizations, through the Middle Ages and Renaissance to the modern then houses from Japan, and China and the homes of Eskimos, and dwellings from Africa, Japan, China and Lapland, and dwellings of Native Americans, Aztecs and Incas.  These dwellings were designed by Garnier with more imagination than strict historic accuracy, but they were picturesque and very popular.  The Roman House had a special function, as the residence of the President of France when he visited the Exposition. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, Catalog of Exposition (1989), pg. 132-135}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 \"Casa egipcia\" (3784820432).jpg|The Egyptian House of the History of Habitation, by Charles Garnier \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537073 (3784014313).jpg|The Aztec House and Incan House by Charles Garnier \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537049 (3784820368).jpg|The Roman House and the Gallo-Roman House, by Charles Garnier\n\n</gallery>\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nMany smaller but picturesque buildings were included within or adjacent to the Exposition.  The architect [[Hector Guimard]], then just twenty-two years old, built his first two buildings for the Exposition; The cafe-restaurant Au Grand Neptune at 148 Quai Louis-Bleriot (Paris 16th arrondissement), and a small Pavillon of Electricity for an electrician named Ferdinand de Boy\u00e9res, located just outside the Exposition site at avenue de Suffren.  The Pavilion of electricity was demolished immediately after the Exposition, and the cafe was torn down in 1910.\n\n{{quote|the exhibition will be famous for four distinctive features.  In the first place, for its buildings, especially the Eiffel tower and the Machinery Hall; in the second place, for its Colonial Exhibition, which for the first time brings vividly to the appreciation of the Frenchmen that they are masters of lands beyond the sea; thirdly, it will be remembered for its great collection of war material, the most absorbing subject now-a-days, unfortunately, to governments if not to individuals; and fourthly, it will be remembered, and with good cause by many, for the extraordinary manner in which South American countries are represented.}}\n\n==Science and technology==\nOne important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology. [[Thomas Edison]] visited the Exposition to visit a pavilion devoted to his recent inventions, including an improved phonograph clearer better sound quality. There were pavilions especially devoted to the telephone and to electrcity, and others devoted to maritime navigation and to military technology.  \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\n<'gallery>\n\n</gallery>\n== Music and Entertainment ==\nThe Exposition itself included several large theatres for concerts and spectacles, including one for the dancers of Les Follies Parisiens.   A  separate theatre presented the music and dance of the French colonies in Indochina. Operas and concerts were also given in the grand hall of the Trocadero Palace. <ref>Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989), pg. 105 </ref>\n\n* The [[Op\u00e9ra Comique]] premiered on 14 May 1889 with a work specially composed for that event: [[Jules Massenet]]'s ''[[Esclarmonde]]'' (debuting American [[soprano]] [[Sybil Sanderson]]).\n\n* The [[Barnum and Bailey Circus]] performed during the Exposition in the Salle des Fetes of the Palais des Machines.\n\n* At the Exposition, the French composer [[Claude Debussy]] first heard [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[gamelan]] music, performed by an ensemble from Java.

The most notable surivor was the [[Eiffel Tower]], which had been deliberately built on Paris city-owned land, to avoid demolition.\n\nThe Exhibition included a building by the Paris architect Pierre-Henri Picq.  This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine-Egyptian-Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to [[Fort-de-France]] in [[Martinique]] and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Schoelcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that [[Victor Schoelcher]] had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in [[Martinique]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Exposition Universelle (1878)]]\n*[[Champ de Mars, Paris]]\n*[[Colonial Exhibition]]\n*[[Human zoo]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Ageorges, Sylvain (2006), ''Sur les traces des Expositions Universelles'' (in French), Parigramme. {{ISBN|978-28409-6444-5}}\n* Jonnes, Jill, ''Eiffel's Tower'' (2013), Penguin Putnam {{ISBN|978-01431-1729-2}}\n* Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay,  ''1889 - La Tour Eiffel et l'Exposition Universelle'' (1989) (in French), \u00c9ditions de la R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux, Paris {{ISBN|2-7118-2244-3}} (Catalog of a centennial exhibition on the Expositon in 1989) \n* ''Engineering'' [Journal] 3 May 1889 (vol XLVII), London: Office for Advertisements and Publication, 1866- (ISSN 0013-7782)\n* ''Structural iron and steel,'' 1850-1900, edited by Robert Thorne; Aldershot, Hampshire, Great Britain; Burlington, Vt., USA: Ashgate/Variorum, c2000 ({{ISBN|0860787591}})\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Exposition Universelle (1889)}}\n*Young, P.
