This was not the only possible classification scheme: In the [[Hunterian lectures]] delivered at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1863, Huxley grouped the vertebrates into [[mammal]]s, sauroids, and ichthyoids (the latter containing the fishes and amphibians). He subsequently proposed the names of [[Sauropsida]] and [[Ichthyopsida]] for the latter two groups.<ref>Huxley, T.H. (1863): The Structure and Classification of the Mammalia.

Goodrich]] to distinguish between lizards, birds, and their relatives on the one hand (Sauropsida) and [[mammal]]s and their extinct relatives (Theropsida) on the other. Goodrich supported this division by the nature of the hearts and blood vessels in each group, and other features, such as the structure of the forebrain. According to Goodrich, both lineages evolved from an earlier stem group, Protosauria (\"first lizards\") in which he included some animals today considered [[Reptiliomorpha|reptile-like amphibians]], as well as early reptiles.<ref name=\"goodrich1916\">{{cite journal |last=Goodrich |first=E.S. |title=On the classification of the Reptilia |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B |volume=89 |pages=261\u2013276 |year=1916 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1916.0012 |doi-access=free |issue=615|bibcode=1916RSPSB..89..261G }}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, [[D.

While Gauthier's definition was close to the modern consensus, nonetheless, it became considered inadequate because the actual relationship of turtles to other reptiles was not yet well understood at this time.<ref name=modestoanderson2004/> Major revisions since have included the reassignment of synapsids as non-reptiles, and classification of turtles as diapsids.<ref name=\"modestoanderson2004\" />\n\nA variety of other definitions were proposed by other scientists in the years following Gauthier's paper. The first such new definition, which attempted to adhere to the standards of the [[PhyloCode]], was published by Modesto and Anderson in 2004. Modesto and Anderson reviewed the many previous definitions and proposed a modified definition, which they intended to retain most traditional content of the group while keeping it stable and monophyletic. They defined Reptilia as all amniotes closer to ''[[Lacerta agilis]]'' and ''[[Crocodylus niloticus]]'' than to ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. This stem-based definition is equivalent to the more common definition of Sauropsida, which Modesto and Anderson synonymized with Reptilia, since the latter is better known and more frequently used.

Lung ventilation is accomplished differently in each main reptile group. In [[squamata|squamates]], the lungs are ventilated almost exclusively by the axial musculature. This is also the same musculature that is used during locomotion. Because of this constraint, most squamates are forced to hold their breath during intense runs. Some, however, have found a way around it. Varanids, and a few other lizard species, employ [[buccal pumping]] as a complement to their normal \"axial breathing\". This allows the animals to completely fill their lungs during intense locomotion, and thus remain aerobically active for a long time. [[Tupinambis|Tegu lizards]] are known to possess a proto-[[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], which separates the pulmonary cavity from the visceral cavity. While not actually capable of movement, it does allow for greater lung inflation, by taking the weight of the viscera off the lungs.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Klein | first=Wilfied |author2=Abe, Augusto |author3=Andrade, Denis |author4= Perry, Steven | title=Structure of the posthepatic septum and its influence on visceral topology in the tegu lizard, ''Tupinambis merianae'' (Teidae: Reptilia) | journal=Journal of Morphology | volume=258 | issue=2 | year=2003 | pages=151\u2013157 | doi=10.1002/jmor.10136 | pmid=14518009| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/40cdb976a769e620ea800e48811e17b764605644 }}</ref>\n[[File:Alligatorbellowedit.ogg|left|thumb|With such a great area for lung expansion, [[American alligators]] use this space to create infrasound vibrations during mating that also includes a loud bellow.]]\n[[Crocodilia]]ns actually have a muscular diaphragm that is analogous to the mammalian diaphragm. The difference is that the muscles for the crocodilian diaphragm pull the pubis (part of the pelvis, which is movable in crocodilians) back, which brings the liver down, thus freeing space for the lungs to expand. This type of diaphragmatic setup has been referred to as the \"[[Liver|hepatic]] [[piston]]\". The [[Bronchus|airways]] form a number of double tubular chambers within each lung.

Crocodilians have evolved a bony secondary palate that allows them to continue breathing while remaining submerged (and protect their brains against damage by struggling prey). Skinks (family Scincidae) also have evolved a bony secondary palate, to varying degrees. Snakes took a different approach and extended their trachea instead. Their tracheal extension sticks out like a fleshy straw, and allows these animals to swallow large prey without suffering from asphyxiation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiodini|first=Rodrick J.|last2=Sundberg|first2=John P.|last3=Czikowsky|first3=Joyce A.|date=January 1982|editor-last=Timmins|editor-first=Patricia|title=Gross anatomy of snakes.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241830127|journal=Veterinary Medicine/Small Animal Clinician|volume=|pages=|via=ResearchGate}}</ref>\n\n====Turtles and tortoises====\n[[File:Tortue de Floride Amiens.jpg|thumb|[[Red-eared slider]] taking a gulp of air]]\n\nHow [[turtle|turtles and tortoises]] breathe has been the subject of much study. To date, only a few species have been studied thoroughly enough to get an idea of how those turtles [[Breathing|breathe]]. The varied results indicate that turtles and tortoises have found a variety of solutions to this problem.\n\nThe difficulty is that most [[turtle shell]]s are rigid and do not allow for the type of expansion and contraction that other amniotes use to ventilate their lungs. Some turtles, such as the Indian flapshell (''Lissemys punctata''), have a sheet of muscle that envelops the lungs. When it contracts, the turtle can exhale. When at rest, the turtle can retract the limbs into the body cavity and force air out of the lungs. When the turtle protracts its limbs, the pressure inside the lungs is reduced, and the turtle can suck air in. Turtle lungs are attached to the inside of the top of the shell (carapace), with the bottom of the lungs attached (via connective tissue) to the rest of the viscera. By using a series of special muscles (roughly equivalent to a [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]), turtles are capable of pushing their viscera up and down, resulting in effective respiration, since many of these muscles have attachment points in conjunction with their forelimbs (indeed, many of the muscles expand into the limb pockets during contraction).<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Tyler R.|last1=Lyson|first2=Emma R.|last2=Schachner|first3=Jennifer|last3=Botha-Brink|first4=Torsten M.|last4=Scheyer|first5=Markus|last5=Lambertz|first6=G.S.|last6=Bever|first7=Bruce S.|last7=Rubidge|first8=Kevin|last8=de Queiroz|year=2014|title=Origin of the unique ventilatory apparatus of turtles|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|number=5211|doi=10.1038/ncomms6211|pages=5211|pmid=25376734|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E5211L|url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/100716/7/LysonEtAl_NatCommun2014_Vol5_OriginVentilationApparatusTurtles_Supplem_s1.pdf}}{{open access}}</ref>\n\nBreathing during locomotion has been studied in three species, and they show different patterns.

The last species to have been studied is the red-eared slider, which also breathes during locomotion, but takes smaller breaths during locomotion than during small pauses between locomotor bouts, indicating that there may be mechanical interference between the limb movements and the breathing apparatus.

Compared to mammalian skin, that of reptiles is rather thin and lacks the thick [[dermis|dermal]] layer that produces [[leather]] in mammals.<ref>Hildebran, M. & Goslow, G.

In [[lepidosauria]]ns, such as lizards and snakes, the whole skin is covered in overlapping [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermal]] scales. Such scales were once thought to be typical of the class Reptilia as a whole, but are now known to occur only in lepidosaurians.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The scales found in turtles and crocodiles are of [[dermis|dermal]], rather than epidermal, origin and are properly termed scutes.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In turtles, the body is hidden inside a hard shell composed of fused scutes.\n\nLacking a thick dermis, reptilian leather is not as strong as mammalian leather. It is used in leather-wares for decorative purposes for shoes, belts and handbags, particularly crocodile skin.\n\n'''Shedding.''' Reptiles shed their skin through a process called [[ecdysis]] which occurs continuously throughout their lifetime. In particular, younger reptiles tend to shed once every 5\u20136 weeks while adults shed 3\u20134 times a year.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Paterson|first1=Sue|title=Skin Diseases of Exotic Pets|date=December 17, 2007|publisher=Blackwell Science, Ltd.|isbn=9780470752432|pages=74\u201379}}</ref> Younger reptiles shed more because of their rapid growth rate. Once full size, the frequency of shedding drastically decreases. The process of ecdysis involves forming a new layer of skin under the old one. Proteolytic enzymes and lymphatic fluid is secreted between the old and new layers of skin. Consequently, this lifts the old skin from the new one allowing shedding to occur.<ref name=\"Dermatological Diseases in Lizards\">{{cite journal|last1=Hellebuyck|first1=Tom|last2=Pasmans|first2=Frank|last3=Haesbrouck|first3=Freddy|last4=Martel|first4=An|title=Dermatological Diseases in Lizards|journal=The Veterinary Journal|date=July 2012|volume=193|issue=1|pages=38\u201345|doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.02.001|pmid=22417690}}</ref> Snakes will shed from the head to the tail while lizards shed in a \"patchy pattern\".<ref name=\"Dermatological Diseases in Lizards\"/> [[Dysecdysis]], a common skin disease in snakes and lizards, will occur when ecdysis, or shedding, fails.<ref name=\"Veterinary Nursing of Exotic Pets\">{{cite book|last1=Girling|first1=Simon|title=Veterinary Nursing of Exotic Pets|date=June 26, 2013|publisher=Blackwell Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9781118782941|edition=2}}</ref> There are numerous reasons why shedding fails and can be related to inadequate humidity and temperature, nutritional deficiencies, dehydration and traumatic injuries.<ref name=\"Dermatological Diseases in Lizards\"/> Nutritional deficiencies decrease proteolytic enzymes while dehydration reduces lymphatic fluids to separate the skin layers.

In diapsids, [[uric acid]] is the main [[nitrogen]]ous waste product; turtles, like [[mammal]]s, excrete mainly [[urea]]. Unlike the kidneys of mammals and birds, reptile kidneys are unable to produce liquid urine more concentrated than their body fluid. This is because they lack a specialized structure called a [[loop of Henle]], which is present in the [[nephron]]s of birds and mammals. Because of this, many reptiles use the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] to aid in the [[reabsorption]] of water. Some are also able to take up water stored in the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]. Excess salts are also excreted by nasal and lingual [[salt gland]]s in some reptiles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/salt-gland|title=Salt Gland \u2013 an overview &#124; ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>\n\nIn all reptiles the urinogenital ducts and the [[anus]] both empty into an organ called a [[cloaca]]. In some reptiles, a midventral wall in the cloaca may open into a urinary bladder, but not all.

The vision is typically adapted to daylight conditions, with color vision and more advanced visual [[depth perception]] than in amphibians and most mammals.\n\nReptiles usually have excellent vision, allowing them to detect shapes and motions at long distances. They often have only a few [[Rod cell]]s and have poor vision in low-light conditions.

This \u201ceye\u201d does not work the same way as a normal eye does as it has only a rudimentary retina and lens and thus, cannot form images. It is however sensitive to changes in light and dark and can detect movement.<ref name=Brames/>\n\nSome snakes have extra sets of visual organs (in the loosest sense of the word) in the form of pits sensitive to [[infrared]] radiation (heat). Such heat-sensitive pits are particularly well developed in the [[pit vipers]], but are also found in [[boidae|boas]] and [[pythonidae|pythons]].

Notably, it protects a crocodilian's eyeball surface while allowing a degree of vision underwater.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/nictitating-membrane|title=Nictitating membrane {{!}} anatomy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> However, many squamates, geckos and snakes in particular, lack eyelids, which are replaced by a transparent scale.

All reproductive activity occurs through the [[cloaca]], the single exit/entrance at the base of the tail where waste is also eliminated. Most reptiles have [[copulatory organ]]s, which are usually retracted or inverted and stored inside the body. In turtles and crocodilians, the male has a single median [[penis]], while squamates, including snakes and lizards, possess a pair of [[hemipenis|hemipenes]], only one of which is typically used in each session. Tuatara, however, lack copulatory organs, and so the male and female simply press their cloacas together as the male discharges sperm.<ref>Lutz, Dick (2005), Tuatara: A Living Fossil, Salem, Oregon: DIMI Press, {{ISBN|978-0-931625-43-5}}</ref>\n\nMost reptiles lay amniotic eggs covered with leathery or calcareous shells. An [[amnion]], [[chorion]], and [[allantois]] are present during [[embryo]]nic life. The eggshell (1) protects the crocodile embryo (11) and keeps it from drying out, but it is flexible to allow gas exchange. The chorion (6) aids in gas exchange between the inside and outside of the egg. It allows carbon dioxide to exit the egg and oxygen gas to enter the egg. The albumin (9) further protects the embryo and serves as a reservoir for water and protein. The allantois (8) is a sac that collects the metabolic waste produced by the embryo. The amniotic sac (10) contains amniotic fluid (12) which protects and cushions the embryo. The amnion (5) aids in osmoregulation and serves as a saltwater reservoir. The yolk sac (2) surrounding the yolk (3) contains protein and fat rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo via vessels (4) that allow the embryo to grow and metabolize. The air space (7) provides the embryo with oxygen while it is hatching. This ensures that the embryo will not suffocate while it is hatching. There are no [[larva]]l stages of development. [[Viviparity]] and [[ovoviviparity]] have evolved in many extinct clades of reptiles and in squamates. In the latter group, many species, including all boas and most vipers, utilize this mode of reproduction. The degree of viviparity varies; some species simply retain the eggs until just before hatching, others provide maternal nourishment to supplement the yolk, and yet others lack any yolk and provide all nutrients via a structure similar to the mammalian [[placenta]]. The earliest documented case of viviparity in reptiles is the Early [[Permian]] [[mesosaur]]s,<ref name=PFML12>{{cite journal |last=Pi\u00f1eiro |first=G. |author2=Ferigolo, J. |author3=Meneghel, M. |author4= Laurin, M. |year=2012 |title=The oldest known amniotic embryos suggest viviparity in mesosaurs |journal=Historical Biology |volume= 24|issue=6 |doi=10.1080/08912963.2012.662230 |pages=620\u2013630|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/532484bf10feb78398e790f54cea0a2a8ee15a98 }}</ref> although some individuals or taxa in that clade may also have been oviparous because a putative isolated egg has also been found.

In some species of squamates, a population of females is able to produce a unisexual diploid clone of the mother. This form of asexual reproduction, called [[parthenogenesis]], occurs in several species of [[gecko]], and is particularly widespread in the [[teiidae|teiids]] (especially ''Aspidocelis'') and [[lacertidae|lacertids]] (''[[Lacerta (genus)|Lacerta]]''). In captivity, [[Komodo dragon]]s (Varanidae) have reproduced by [[parthenogenesis]].\n\nParthenogenetic species are suspected to occur among [[chameleon]]s, [[agamidae|agamids]], [[night lizard|xantusiids]], and [[typhlopidae|typhlopids]].\n\nSome reptiles exhibit [[temperature-dependent sex determination]] (TDSD), in which the incubation temperature determines whether a particular egg hatches as male or female.

Goodrich supported this division by the nature of the hearts and blood vessels in each group, and other features, such as the structure of the forebrain.

Mammalia and Aves are, in fact, subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota. But the traditional class Reptilia is not a clade. It is just a section of the clade [[Amniota]]: the section that is left after the Mammalia and Aves have been hived off. It cannot be defined by [[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]], as is the proper way. Instead, it is defined by a combination of the features it has and the features it lacks: reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers.

In 1988, [[Jacques Gauthier]] proposed a [[cladistics|cladistic]] definition of Reptilia as a monophyletic node-based [[crown group]] containing turtles, lizards and snakes, crocodilians, and birds, their common ancestor and all its descendants. While Gauthier's definition was close to the modern consensus, nonetheless, it became considered inadequate because the actual relationship of turtles to other reptiles was not yet well understood at this time.<ref name=modestoanderson2004/> Major revisions since have included the reassignment of synapsids as non-reptiles, and classification of turtles as diapsids.<ref name=\"modestoanderson2004\" />\n\nA variety of other definitions were proposed by other scientists in the years following Gauthier's paper. The first such new definition, which attempted to adhere to the standards of the [[PhyloCode]], was published by Modesto and Anderson in 2004. Modesto and Anderson reviewed the many previous definitions and proposed a modified definition, which they intended to retain most traditional content of the group while keeping it stable and monophyletic. They defined Reptilia as all amniotes closer to ''[[Lacerta agilis]]'' and ''[[Crocodylus niloticus]]'' than to ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. This stem-based definition is equivalent to the more common definition of Sauropsida, which Modesto and Anderson synonymized with Reptilia, since the latter is better known and more frequently used. Unlike most previous definitions of Reptilia, however, Modesto and Anderson's definition includes birds,<ref name=modestoanderson2004/> as they are within the clade that includes both lizards and crocodiles.<ref name=\"modestoanderson2004\" />\n\n===Taxonomy===\n{{See also|List of reptiles|List of snakes}}\nClassification to order level of the reptiles, after Benton, 2014.<ref name=\"benton2005\">{{cite book |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael J.

Lung ventilation is accomplished differently in each main reptile group. In [[squamata|squamates]], the lungs are ventilated almost exclusively by the axial musculature. This is also the same musculature that is used during locomotion. Because of this constraint, most squamates are forced to hold their breath during intense runs. Some, however, have found a way around it. Varanids, and a few other lizard species, employ [[buccal pumping]] as a complement to their normal \"axial breathing\". This allows the animals to completely fill their lungs during intense locomotion, and thus remain aerobically active for a long time. [[Tupinambis|Tegu lizards]] are known to possess a proto-[[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], which separates the pulmonary cavity from the visceral cavity. While not actually capable of movement, it does allow for greater lung inflation, by taking the weight of the viscera off the lungs.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Klein | first=Wilfied |author2=Abe, Augusto |author3=Andrade, Denis |author4= Perry, Steven | title=Structure of the posthepatic septum and its influence on visceral topology in the tegu lizard, ''Tupinambis merianae'' (Teidae: Reptilia) | journal=Journal of Morphology | volume=258 | issue=2 | year=2003 | pages=151\u2013157 | doi=10.1002/jmor.10136 | pmid=14518009| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/40cdb976a769e620ea800e48811e17b764605644 }}</ref>\n[[File:Alligatorbellowedit.ogg|left|thumb|With such a great area for lung expansion, [[American alligators]] use this space to create infrasound vibrations during mating that also includes a loud bellow.]]\n[[Crocodilia]]ns actually have a muscular diaphragm that is analogous to the mammalian diaphragm. The difference is that the muscles for the crocodilian diaphragm pull the pubis (part of the pelvis, which is movable in crocodilians) back, which brings the liver down, thus freeing space for the lungs to expand. This type of diaphragmatic setup has been referred to as the \"[[Liver|hepatic]] [[piston]]\". The [[Bronchus|airways]] form a number of double tubular chambers within each lung.

To date, only a few species have been studied thoroughly enough to get an idea of how those turtles [[Breathing|breathe]]. The varied results indicate that turtles and tortoises have found a variety of solutions to this problem.\n\nThe difficulty is that most [[turtle shell]]s are rigid and do not allow for the type of expansion and contraction that other amniotes use to ventilate their lungs. Some turtles, such as the Indian flapshell (''Lissemys punctata''), have a sheet of muscle that envelops the lungs. When it contracts, the turtle can exhale. When at rest, the turtle can retract the limbs into the body cavity and force air out of the lungs. When the turtle protracts its limbs, the pressure inside the lungs is reduced, and the turtle can suck air in. Turtle lungs are attached to the inside of the top of the shell (carapace), with the bottom of the lungs attached (via connective tissue) to the rest of the viscera. By using a series of special muscles (roughly equivalent to a [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]), turtles are capable of pushing their viscera up and down, resulting in effective respiration, since many of these muscles have attachment points in conjunction with their forelimbs (indeed, many of the muscles expand into the limb pockets during contraction).<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Tyler R.|last1=Lyson|first2=Emma R.|last2=Schachner|first3=Jennifer|last3=Botha-Brink|first4=Torsten M.|last4=Scheyer|first5=Markus|last5=Lambertz|first6=G.S.|last6=Bever|first7=Bruce S.|last7=Rubidge|first8=Kevin|last8=de Queiroz|year=2014|title=Origin of the unique ventilatory apparatus of turtles|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|number=5211|doi=10.1038/ncomms6211|pages=5211|pmid=25376734|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E5211L|url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/100716/7/LysonEtAl_NatCommun2014_Vol5_OriginVentilationApparatusTurtles_Supplem_s1.pdf}}{{open access}}</ref>\n\nBreathing during locomotion has been studied in three species, and they show different patterns.

All reproductive activity occurs through the [[cloaca]], the single exit/entrance at the base of the tail where waste is also eliminated. Most reptiles have [[copulatory organ]]s, which are usually retracted or inverted and stored inside the body. In turtles and crocodilians, the male has a single median [[penis]], while squamates, including snakes and lizards, possess a pair of [[hemipenis|hemipenes]], only one of which is typically used in each session. Tuatara, however, lack copulatory organs, and so the male and female simply press their cloacas together as the male discharges sperm.<ref>Lutz, Dick (2005), Tuatara: A Living Fossil, Salem, Oregon: DIMI Press, {{ISBN|978-0-931625-43-5}}</ref>\n\nMost reptiles lay amniotic eggs covered with leathery or calcareous shells. An [[amnion]], [[chorion]], and [[allantois]] are present during [[embryo]]nic life. The eggshell (1) protects the crocodile embryo (11) and keeps it from drying out, but it is flexible to allow gas exchange. The chorion (6) aids in gas exchange between the inside and outside of the egg. It allows carbon dioxide to exit the egg and oxygen gas to enter the egg. The albumin (9) further protects the embryo and serves as a reservoir for water and protein. The allantois (8) is a sac that collects the metabolic waste produced by the embryo. The amniotic sac (10) contains amniotic fluid (12) which protects and cushions the embryo. The amnion (5) aids in osmoregulation and serves as a saltwater reservoir. The yolk sac (2) surrounding the yolk (3) contains protein and fat rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo via vessels (4) that allow the embryo to grow and metabolize. The air space (7) provides the embryo with oxygen while it is hatching. This ensures that the embryo will not suffocate while it is hatching. There are no [[larva]]l stages of development. [[Viviparity]] and [[ovoviviparity]] have evolved in many extinct clades of reptiles and in squamates. In the latter group, many species, including all boas and most vipers, utilize this mode of reproduction. The degree of viviparity varies; some species simply retain the eggs until just before hatching, others provide maternal nourishment to supplement the yolk, and yet others lack any yolk and provide all nutrients via a structure similar to the mammalian [[placenta]]. The earliest documented case of viviparity in reptiles is the Early [[Permian]] [[mesosaur]]s,<ref name=PFML12>{{cite journal |last=Pi\u00f1eiro |first=G. |author2=Ferigolo, J. |author3=Meneghel, M. |author4= Laurin, M. |year=2012 |title=The oldest known amniotic embryos suggest viviparity in mesosaurs |journal=Historical Biology |volume= 24|issue=6 |doi=10.1080/08912963.2012.662230 |pages=620\u2013630|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/532484bf10feb78398e790f54cea0a2a8ee15a98 }}</ref> although some individuals or taxa in that clade may also have been oviparous because a putative isolated egg has also been found.

In some species of squamates, a population of females is able to produce a unisexual diploid clone of the mother. This form of asexual reproduction, called [[parthenogenesis]], occurs in several species of [[gecko]], and is particularly widespread in the [[teiidae|teiids]] (especially ''Aspidocelis'') and [[lacertidae|lacertids]] (''[[Lacerta (genus)|Lacerta]]''). In captivity, [[Komodo dragon]]s (Varanidae) have reproduced by [[parthenogenesis]].\n\nParthenogenetic species are suspected to occur among [[chameleon]]s, [[agamidae|agamids]], [[night lizard|xantusiids]], and [[typhlopidae|typhlopids]].\n\nSome reptiles exhibit [[temperature-dependent sex determination]] (TDSD), in which the incubation temperature determines whether a particular egg hatches as male or female.
