The city proper has 108,365 inhabitants ({{As of|2012|lc=y}}), while its urban area has 420,000, making Caen the largest city in former Lower Normandy.

Caen is located in the centre of its northern region, and it is a centre of political, economic and cultural power. Located a few miles from the coast, the landing beaches, the bustling resorts of [[Deauville]] and [[Cabourg]], [[Norman Switzerland]] and [[Pays d'Auge]], Caen is often considered the archetype of Normandy.\n\nCaen is known for its historical buildings built during the reign of [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], who was buried there, and for the [[Battle for Caen]]\u2014heavy fighting that took place in and around Caen during the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] in 1944, destroying much of the city.

It remained a minor settlement throughout the Roman period and began to see major development commence in the 10th century, under the patronage of the Dukes of Normandy. Around 1060, [[William the Conqueror]] began construction on the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Caen]], which became the centre of the ducal court. Duchess [[Matilda of Flanders]] also founded the [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen]] around the same time, eventually being buried in the abbey. Caen succeeded [[Bayeux]] as the capital of [[Lower Normandy]], complementing the second ducal capital of [[Rouen]].\n\nCaen fell to [[Philip II of France]] on 21 May 1204, and was incorporated along with the remainder of Normandy into the Kingdom of France.\n\n===Hundred Years' War===\n{{Main|Battle of Caen (1346)}}\nIn 1346, King [[Edward III of England]] led his army against the city, hoping to loot it. It was expected that a siege of perhaps several weeks would be required, but the army took the city in less than a day, on 26 July 1346, [[Battle of Caen (1346)|storming and sacking it]], killing 3,000 of its citizens, and burning much of the merchants' quarter on the Ile Ste-Jean. During the attack, English officials searched its archives and found a copy of the [[Ordinance of Normandy|1339 Franco-Norman plot]] to invade England, devised by [[Philip VI of France]] and Normandy. This was subsequently used as propaganda to justify the supplying and financing of the conflict and its continuation. Only the castle of Caen held out, despite attempts to besiege it. A few days later, the English left, marching to the east and on to their victory at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]]. It was later [[Siege of Caen (1417)|captured following a siege]] by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] in 1417 and treated harshly for being the first town to put up any resistance to his invasion. In 1450 towards the end of the war, French forces [[Siege of Caen (1450)|recaptured Caen]].\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Battle for Caen}}\n[[File:Canadian bulldozer in Caen.jpg|thumb|upright|Ruins of Caen]]\nDuring the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] in the Second World War, Caen was [[Battle for Caen|liberated]] from the Nazis in early July, a month after the [[Normandy landings]], particularly those by [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|British I Corps]] on 6 June 1944. British and Canadian troops had intended to capture the town on [[D-Day]]. However they were held up north of the city until 9 July, when an intense bombing campaign during [[Operation Charnwood]] destroyed 70% of the city and killed 2,000 French civilians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crhq.cnrs.fr/1944/Basse-Normandie.php |title=M\u00e9morial des victimes civiles 1944 en Basse-Normandie |publisher=Crhq.cnrs.fr |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> The Allies seized the western quarters, a month later than [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field Marshal Montgomery]]'s original plan. During the battle, many of the town's inhabitants sought refuge in the ''Abbaye aux Hommes'' (\"Men's Abbey\"), built by William the Conqueror some 800 years before. The spire of the [[Church of Saint-Pierre, Caen]] and the university were destroyed by the British and Canadian bombing.\n\n===Post-war===\nPost-Second World War work included the reconstruction of complete districts of the city and the university campus. It took 14 years (1948\u20131962) and led to the current urbanization of Caen. Having lost many of its historic quarters and its university campus in the war, the city does not have the atmosphere of a traditional Normandy town such as [[Honfleur]], [[Rouen]], [[Cabourg]], [[Deauville]] and [[Bayeux]].\n\nThe Canadian Army Film and Photo Unit filmed the D-Day offensive and Orne breakout several weeks later, then returned several months later to document the city's recovery efforts. The resulting film, ''You Can't Kill a City'', is preserved in the [[National Archives of Canada]].\n\n====Images====\n<gallery>\nFile:Escoville Angle.jpg|H\u00f4tel d'Escoville, 16th century, Caen\nFile:PlanCaenFortification.jpg|Anonymous pen-and-ink bird's-eye view of the fortifications of Caen ([[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], Paris)\nFile:Chateau_Caen.jpg|South Wall of the Castle, a huge fortress in the centre of the city\nFile:Caen H\u00f4tel de Ville.JPG|Town Hall of Caen\nFile:Caen gare bv.jpg|[[Gare de Caen|Caen railway station]]\nFile:Tramway de Caen Station.jpg|Caen's former 'tramway' was in fact a modern guided-bus system.

A canal ([[Canal de Caen \u00e0 la Mer]]) parallel to the Orne was built during the reign of [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to link the city to the sea at all times. The canal reaches the [[English Channel]] at [[Ouistreham]]. A lock keeps the tide out of the canal and lets large ships navigate up the canal to Caen's freshwater harbours.\n\n===Climate===\nCaen has an [[oceanic climate]] that is somewhat ameliorated due to its slightly inland position. In spite of this, summers are still cool by French standards and the climate is typically maritime in terms of high precipitation, relatively modest sunshine hours and mild winters.\n\n{{Caen weatherbox}}\n\n==Main sights==\n===Castle===\nThe castle, ''[[Ch\u00e2teau de Caen]]'', built circa 1060 by William the Conqueror, who successfully [[Norman Conquest of England|conquered England]] in 1066, is one of the largest medieval fortresses of Western Europe. It remained an essential feature of [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] strategy and policy. At Christmas 1182, a [[royal court]] celebration for Christmas in the [[wikt:Special:Search/aula|aula]] of Caen Castle brought together [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and his sons, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] and [[John of England|John Lackland]], receiving more than a thousand knights. Caen Castle, along with all of Normandy, was handed over to the French Crown in 1204. The castle saw several engagements during the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1346, 1417, 1450) and was in use as a barracks as late as the Second World War. Bullet holes are visible on the walls of the castle where members of the [[French Resistance]] were shot during the Second World War. Today, the castle serves as a museum that houses the ''Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Caen'' (Museum of [[Fine art|Fine Arts]] of Caen) and ''Mus\u00e9e de Normandie'' (Museum of Normandy) along with many periodical exhibitions about arts and history.

The population of the \"communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration\" is around 220000 inhabitants.\n\nIn the former administrative organisation, Caen was a part of 9 [[canton in France|cantons]], of which it was the chief town. These cantons contained a total of 13 towns. Caen gave its name to a 10th canton, of which it was not part. Since the 2015 canton reorganization, Caen is part of the cantons of [[Canton of Caen-1|Caen-1]], [[Canton of Caen-2|2]], [[Canton of Caen-3|3]], [[Canton of Caen-4|4]] and [[Canton of Caen-5|5]].<ref name=decret>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000028625983|title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2014-160 du 17 f\u00e9vrier 2014 portant d\u00e9limitation des cantons dans le d\u00e9partement du Calvados &#124; Legifrance|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\nFormerly, Caen had [[Caen Guided Light Transit|guided bus]] system\u2014built by [[Bombardier Transportation]] and modelled on its [[Bombardier Guided Light Transit|Guided Light Transit]] technology. Faced with the residents' anger against the project, the municipality had to pursue the project with only 23% of the population in favour{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} of the new form of transport.

The city is connected to the rest of the Calvados d\u00e9partement by the [[Bus Verts du Calvados]] [[bus network]].\n\n[[Caen - Carpiquet Airport]] is the biggest airport in Normandy considering the number of passengers and flights that it serves every year. Most flights are operated by [[HOP!]] and [[Chalair Aviation]], Volotea and Flybe and the French [[Flag carrier|national airline]] [[Air France]] operates three daily flights to the French cities of [[Lyon]] and Marseille. [[Flybe]] also operate year-round services to [[London Southend Airport|London]]. In the summer there are many [[Charter airline|flights]] to Spain, Germany, [[Tunisia]], Morocco and [[Algeria]].\n\nCaen is served by the large port of [[Ouistreham]], lying at the mouth of the [[Caen Canal]] where it meets the [[English Channel]]. A cruise/ferry service operates between [[Portsmouth]], England, and Caen/Ouistreham running both standard roll-on-roll-off car ferries and supercat fast ferries, with the latter making crossing from March to November. The ferry terminal is {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Caen with a daytime shuttle bus service for foot passengers. There's also a cyclist road from Caen to Ouistreham.<ref>[[:fr:Voie verte de Caen \u00e0 Ouistreham|Voie Verte]]</ref>\n\nCaen is connected to the rest of France by [[Autoroutes of France|motorways]] to Paris ([[A13 autoroute|A13]]), [[Brittany]] and Southern France ([[A84 autoroute|A84]]) and to [[Le Mans]] and central France ([[A88 autoroute|A88]]\u2013[[A28 autoroute|A28]]). The A13 and A88 are [[toll road]]s while the A84 is a toll-free motorway. The city is encircled by the [[P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique (Caen)|N814 ring-road]] (Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique) that was completed in the late 1990s. The [[Route nationale 13|N13]] connects Caen to [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] and to Paris. A section of the former N13 (Caen-Paris) is now D613 (in Calvados) following road renumbering. The Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique includes an impressive [[viaduct]] called the [[Viaduc de Calix]] that goes over the canal and [[Orne River|River Orne]]. The canal links the city to the sea to permit [[cargo ship]]s and ferries to dock in the [[port of Caen]]. Ferries which have docked include the ''[[MV Quiberon|Quiberon]]'' and the ''[[MV Duc de Normandie|Duc de Normandie]]''.\n\nAlthough a fraction of what it used to be remains, Caen once boasted an extensive rail and tram network. From 1895 until 1936, the ''[[Tramway de Caen|Compagnie des Tramways Electriques de Caen]]'' (Electrical Tramway Company of Caen) operated all around the city. Caen also had several main and [[Branch line|branch railway]] lines linking [[Gare de Caen|Caen railway station]] to all parts of Normandy with lines to [[Gare St-Lazare|Paris]], [[Vire]], [[Flers, Orne|Flers]], [[Cabourg]], [[Houlgate]], [[Deauville]], [[Saint-L\u00f4]], [[Bayeux]] and [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]]. Now only the electrified line of Paris-Cherbourg, Caen-[[Le Mans]] and Caen-[[Rennes]] subsist with regular services.\n\n==Education==\n* The [[University of Caen]] has around 30,000 students in five different campuses. The University is divided into 11 colleges, called ''UFR'' (''Unit\u00e9 fondamentale de Recherche''), six institutes, one Engineering School, two IUP and five local campuses.

It remained a minor settlement throughout the Roman period and began to see major development commence in the 10th century, under the patronage of the Dukes of Normandy. Around 1060, [[William the Conqueror]] began construction on the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Caen]], which became the centre of the ducal court. Duchess [[Matilda of Flanders]] also founded the [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen]] around the same time, eventually being buried in the abbey. Caen succeeded [[Bayeux]] as the capital of [[Lower Normandy]], complementing the second ducal capital of [[Rouen]].\n\nCaen fell to [[Philip II of France]] on 21 May 1204, and was incorporated along with the remainder of Normandy into the Kingdom of France.\n\n===Hundred Years' War===\n{{Main|Battle of Caen (1346)}}\nIn 1346, King [[Edward III of England]] led his army against the city, hoping to loot it. It was expected that a siege of perhaps several weeks would be required, but the army took the city in less than a day, on 26 July 1346, [[Battle of Caen (1346)|storming and sacking it]], killing 3,000 of its citizens, and burning much of the merchants' quarter on the Ile Ste-Jean. During the attack, English officials searched its archives and found a copy of the [[Ordinance of Normandy|1339 Franco-Norman plot]] to invade England, devised by [[Philip VI of France]] and Normandy. This was subsequently used as propaganda to justify the supplying and financing of the conflict and its continuation. Only the castle of Caen held out, despite attempts to besiege it. A few days later, the English left, marching to the east and on to their victory at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]]. It was later [[Siege of Caen (1417)|captured following a siege]] by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] in 1417 and treated harshly for being the first town to put up any resistance to his invasion. In 1450 towards the end of the war, French forces [[Siege of Caen (1450)|recaptured Caen]].\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Battle for Caen}}\n[[File:Canadian bulldozer in Caen.jpg|thumb|upright|Ruins of Caen]]\nDuring the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] in the Second World War, Caen was [[Battle for Caen|liberated]] from the Nazis in early July, a month after the [[Normandy landings]], particularly those by [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|British I Corps]] on 6 June 1944. British and Canadian troops had intended to capture the town on [[D-Day]]. However they were held up north of the city until 9 July, when an intense bombing campaign during [[Operation Charnwood]] destroyed 70% of the city and killed 2,000 French civilians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crhq.cnrs.fr/1944/Basse-Normandie.php |title=M\u00e9morial des victimes civiles 1944 en Basse-Normandie |publisher=Crhq.cnrs.fr |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> The Allies seized the western quarters, a month later than [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field Marshal Montgomery]]'s original plan. During the battle, many of the town's inhabitants sought refuge in the ''Abbaye aux Hommes'' (\"Men's Abbey\"), built by William the Conqueror some 800 years before. The spire of the [[Church of Saint-Pierre, Caen]] and the university were destroyed by the British and Canadian bombing.\n\n===Post-war===\nPost-Second World War work included the reconstruction of complete districts of the city and the university campus. It took 14 years (1948\u20131962) and led to the current urbanization of Caen. Having lost many of its historic quarters and its university campus in the war, the city does not have the atmosphere of a traditional Normandy town such as [[Honfleur]], [[Rouen]], [[Cabourg]], [[Deauville]] and [[Bayeux]].\n\nThe Canadian Army Film and Photo Unit filmed the D-Day offensive and Orne breakout several weeks later, then returned several months later to document the city's recovery efforts. The resulting film, ''You Can't Kill a City'', is preserved in the [[National Archives of Canada]].\n\n====Images====\n<gallery>\nFile:Escoville Angle.jpg|H\u00f4tel d'Escoville, 16th century, Caen\nFile:PlanCaenFortification.jpg|Anonymous pen-and-ink bird's-eye view of the fortifications of Caen ([[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], Paris)\nFile:Chateau_Caen.jpg|South Wall of the Castle, a huge fortress in the centre of the city\nFile:Caen H\u00f4tel de Ville.JPG|Town Hall of Caen\nFile:Caen gare bv.jpg|[[Gare de Caen|Caen railway station]]\nFile:Tramway de Caen Station.jpg|Caen's former 'tramway' was in fact a modern guided-bus system.

A canal ([[Canal de Caen \u00e0 la Mer]]) parallel to the Orne was built during the reign of [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to link the city to the sea at all times. The canal reaches the [[English Channel]] at [[Ouistreham]]. A lock keeps the tide out of the canal and lets large ships navigate up the canal to Caen's freshwater harbours.\n\n===Climate===\nCaen has an [[oceanic climate]] that is somewhat ameliorated due to its slightly inland position.

It remained an essential feature of [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] strategy and policy. At Christmas 1182, a [[royal court]] celebration for Christmas in the [[wikt:Special:Search/aula|aula]] of Caen Castle brought together [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and his sons, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] and [[John of England|John Lackland]], receiving more than a thousand knights. Caen Castle, along with all of Normandy, was handed over to the French Crown in 1204. The castle saw several engagements during the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1346, 1417, 1450) and was in use as a barracks as late as the Second World War. Bullet holes are visible on the walls of the castle where members of the [[French Resistance]] were shot during the Second World War. Today, the castle serves as a museum that houses the ''Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Caen'' (Museum of [[Fine art|Fine Arts]] of Caen) and ''Mus\u00e9e de Normandie'' (Museum of Normandy) along with many periodical exhibitions about arts and history.

The population of the \"communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration\" is around 220000 inhabitants.\n\nIn the former administrative organisation, Caen was a part of 9 [[canton in France|cantons]], of which it was the chief town. These cantons contained a total of 13 towns. Caen gave its name to a 10th canton, of which it was not part. Since the 2015 canton reorganization, Caen is part of the cantons of [[Canton of Caen-1|Caen-1]], [[Canton of Caen-2|2]], [[Canton of Caen-3|3]], [[Canton of Caen-4|4]] and [[Canton of Caen-5|5]].<ref name=decret>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000028625983|title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2014-160 du 17 f\u00e9vrier 2014 portant d\u00e9limitation des cantons dans le d\u00e9partement du Calvados &#124; Legifrance|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\nFormerly, Caen had [[Caen Guided Light Transit|guided bus]] system\u2014built by [[Bombardier Transportation]] and modelled on its [[Bombardier Guided Light Transit|Guided Light Transit]] technology. Faced with the residents' anger against the project, the municipality had to pursue the project with only 23% of the population in favour{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} of the new form of transport. The road layout of the city centre was deeply{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} transformed and the formerly traffic-jam-free centre's problems are still unresolved{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The system was closed in 2017 to make way for a new tram network, to be opened in 2019<ref>http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/guided-bus-to-tram-plan-confirmed.html</ref>\n\nCaen also has a very efficient{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} network of city buses, operated under the name [[Twisto]]. The city is connected to the rest of the Calvados d\u00e9partement by the [[Bus Verts du Calvados]] [[bus network]].\n\n[[Caen - Carpiquet Airport]] is the biggest airport in Normandy considering the number of passengers and flights that it serves every year. Most flights are operated by [[HOP!]] and [[Chalair Aviation]], Volotea and Flybe and the French [[Flag carrier|national airline]] [[Air France]] operates three daily flights to the French cities of [[Lyon]] and Marseille. [[Flybe]] also operate year-round services to [[London Southend Airport|London]]. In the summer there are many [[Charter airline|flights]] to Spain, Germany, [[Tunisia]], Morocco and [[Algeria]].\n\nCaen is served by the large port of [[Ouistreham]], lying at the mouth of the [[Caen Canal]] where it meets the [[English Channel]]. A cruise/ferry service operates between [[Portsmouth]], England, and Caen/Ouistreham running both standard roll-on-roll-off car ferries and supercat fast ferries, with the latter making crossing from March to November. The ferry terminal is {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Caen with a daytime shuttle bus service for foot passengers. There's also a cyclist road from Caen to Ouistreham.<ref>[[:fr:Voie verte de Caen \u00e0 Ouistreham|Voie Verte]]</ref>\n\nCaen is connected to the rest of France by [[Autoroutes of France|motorways]] to Paris ([[A13 autoroute|A13]]), [[Brittany]] and Southern France ([[A84 autoroute|A84]]) and to [[Le Mans]] and central France ([[A88 autoroute|A88]]\u2013[[A28 autoroute|A28]]). The A13 and A88 are [[toll road]]s while the A84 is a toll-free motorway. The city is encircled by the [[P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique (Caen)|N814 ring-road]] (Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique) that was completed in the late 1990s. The [[Route nationale 13|N13]] connects Caen to [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] and to Paris. A section of the former N13 (Caen-Paris) is now D613 (in Calvados) following road renumbering. The Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique includes an impressive [[viaduct]] called the [[Viaduc de Calix]] that goes over the canal and [[Orne River|River Orne]]. The canal links the city to the sea to permit [[cargo ship]]s and ferries to dock in the [[port of Caen]]. Ferries which have docked include the ''[[MV Quiberon|Quiberon]]'' and the ''[[MV Duc de Normandie|Duc de Normandie]]''.\n\nAlthough a fraction of what it used to be remains, Caen once boasted an extensive rail and tram network. From 1895 until 1936, the ''[[Tramway de Caen|Compagnie des Tramways Electriques de Caen]]'' (Electrical Tramway Company of Caen) operated all around the city. Caen also had several main and [[Branch line|branch railway]] lines linking [[Gare de Caen|Caen railway station]] to all parts of Normandy with lines to [[Gare St-Lazare|Paris]], [[Vire]], [[Flers, Orne|Flers]], [[Cabourg]], [[Houlgate]], [[Deauville]], [[Saint-L\u00f4]], [[Bayeux]] and [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]]. Now only the electrified line of Paris-Cherbourg, Caen-[[Le Mans]] and Caen-[[Rennes]] subsist with regular services.\n\n==Education==\n* The [[University of Caen]] has around 30,000 students in five different campuses. The University is divided into 11 colleges, called ''UFR'' (''Unit\u00e9 fondamentale de Recherche''), six institutes, one Engineering School, two IUP and five local campuses. The University is one of the oldest in France, having been founded by [[Henry VI, King of England]] in 1432.\n* Caen also has a Fine Arts school (''\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts'') and [[grandes \u00e9coles]] such as the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Caen]].\n\n[[File:Caenpanorama wikipedia.jpg|thumb|centre|800px|The Caen skyline facing the [[Church of Saint-Pierre, Caen|Saint-Pierre Church]].
