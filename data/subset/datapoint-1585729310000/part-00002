He writes that by watching these reviews, he \"discovered the idea of a debate on a film, but a respectful one.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chrisstuckmann.com/about-me/|title=About Me|website=Chris Stuckmann Movie Reviews|access-date=April 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417155728/http://www.chrisstuckmann.com/about-me/|archive-date=April 17, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nStuckmann cites his experience watching ''[[Signs (film)|Signs]]'' in theaters as a child as his primary inspiration for becoming a filmmaker. Filmmakers Stuckmann has cited as having heavily influenced him include [[George Lucas]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[M. Night Shyamalan]], and [[Christopher Nolan]]. Throughout high school, Stuckmann wrote and directed numerous homemade movies and short films with friends and family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izw5Iun9E-I|title=Why I Love Movies - Chris Stuckmann|last=Stuckmann|first=Chris|date=March 19, 2012|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===YouTube===\nHe began publishing YouTube reviews of current films in his twenties and published his first film review in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |author=Stuckmann, Chris |title=10 Years Later... |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01lMvPbHldQ |date=August 24, 2019 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=August 24, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191116023733/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01lMvPbHldQ&gl=US&hl=en |archive-date=November 16, 2019 }}</ref> When he began publishing video reviews, there was only a small group of other [[video bloggers]] reviewing films on YouTube.
