He was known for his slightly unusual dress sense and his love for what he describes as \"eye-catching headwear\". His trademark was wearing a selection of woolly [[chullo]]s (sometimes referred to as \"Dappy hats\"), turning up one or both of the ear-flaps of the hat.\n\n==Music career==\n===2000\u201311: N-Dubz era===\n{{main|N-Dubz}}\n\nDappy appeared on the television show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' on 29 November 2007, on [[Phill Jupitus]]' team, and wore a trademark \"Dappy hat\", also giving one to [[Simon Amstell]] to wear as part of the gag. Despite vowing he would not return to the show he appeared for a second time on the guest team on 4 December 2008 and for a third time, on Phill's team, which was broadcast on 18 November 2009. He is known to be a good friend of [[Chris Moyles]] and also gets on well with [[Kwasi Danquah III|Tinchy Stryder]] after releasing a single together, called \"[[Number 1 (Tinchy Stryder song)|Number 1]]\". Dappy has made cameo appearances on K.I.G's \"Head, Shoulders, Kneez and Toez\" music video, Gracious K's \"Migraine Skank\" music video, and [[Chipmunk (rapper)|Chipmunk]]'s \"[[Chip Diddy Chip]]\" music video, as one of Chipmunk's school friends.\n\n===2011\u201314: Solo projects and ''Bad Intentions''===\nIt was announced on 17 June 2011 that N-Dubz had left their American record deal, amid rumours that the band had split.<ref>Darvill, Josh (Friday, 17 June 2011).

Before the band's split, Dappy signed a contract with [[Takeover Entertainment|Takeover Entertainment Ltd]] that confirmed that if the band ever split or went on hiatus, he would continue as a solo artist. His first taste of solo stardom came as a guest artist on label-mate [[Kwasi Danquah III|Tinchy Stryder]]'s single \"Spaceship\", which was released in June 2011. While deciding upon his debut solo single, Dappy was contacted by Def Jam, asking him what he would like done with the demos of a track N-Dubz had recorded whilst under the label, which remained unreleased. Dappy decided to re-record the track, \"[[No Regrets (Dappy song)|No Regrets]]\", and release it as his debut solo effort. Featuring a cameo appearance from band-mate Fazer, \"No Regrets\" took the charts by storm, peaking at #1 in the UK and Scotland, and at #8 in Ireland.\n\nFollowing the success of \"No Regrets\", Dappy claimed during an interview that: \"With my solo stuff, I really want to earn the respect of an older audience.

However, it didn't do as well with the media and was heavily criticized for a scene in which Dappy is standing outside a block of expensive luxury flats with a \"rich kid\" who is trying to look like a gangster. ''The Independent'' wrote, \"His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his coat, pulls him toward him, and punches him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement ...

Before the band's split, Dappy signed a contract with [[Takeover Entertainment|Takeover Entertainment Ltd]] that confirmed that if the band ever split or went on hiatus, he would continue as a solo artist. His first taste of solo stardom came as a guest artist on label-mate [[Kwasi Danquah III|Tinchy Stryder]]'s single \"Spaceship\", which was released in June 2011. While deciding upon his debut solo single, Dappy was contacted by Def Jam, asking him what he would like done with the demos of a track N-Dubz had recorded whilst under the label, which remained unreleased. Dappy decided to re-record the track, \"[[No Regrets (Dappy song)|No Regrets]]\", and release it as his debut solo effort. Featuring a cameo appearance from band-mate Fazer, \"No Regrets\" took the charts by storm, peaking at #1 in the UK and Scotland, and at #8 in Ireland.\n\nFollowing the success of \"No Regrets\", Dappy claimed during an interview that: \"With my solo stuff, I really want to earn the respect of an older audience.

''The Independent'' wrote, \"His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.'

At the time they were called the Lickle Rinsers Crew and went under the management of Dappy's father Byron, to whom Dappy was the \"inspiration behind the band\". Byron worked at a local barbers shop, putting all the money he had into equipment and resources for the band at their studio. However, Byron died on 12 April 2007 after a heart attack and [[N-Dubz]] wrote the song \"[[Papa Can You Hear Me?|Papa (Can You Hear Me?)]]\", which was played at his funeral and became the group's second biggest hit at #19, and at #17 in the download charts.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDappy had the words \"RIP Dad\" tattooed on his neck and doesn't like to say his dad's name, instead referring to him as \"B\" or \"Uncle B\", which was also the name of N-Dubz's [[Uncle B|debut album]]. Before Byron died, he said he'd like their album to be called ''Against All Odds'' but, after his death, the group called their debut album ''[[Uncle B]]'' in tribute, with their second album being called ''[[Against All Odds (N-Dubz album)|Against All Odds]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nHe revealed that he is a \"massive\" [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] fan when N-Dubz appeared on ''[[Live from Studio Five]]'', gushing \"it is an honour to sit next to you\" to former Arsenal striker [[Ian Wright]] who was one of three hosts on the show.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.five.tv/programmes/daytime/live-from-studio-five?filter=Clips&page=5\n |title=Live From Studio Five\n |publisher=Five.tv\n |date=\n |accessdate=11 June 2010\n |df=dmy\n}}{{dead link|date=January 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2015, Dappy endorsed his manager Archie Lamb's father, [[Norman Lamb|Norman]], in the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] [[2015 Liberal Democrats leadership election|leadership election]].<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/rapper-dappy-backs-norman-lambs-bid-for-leadership-of-lib-dems|title = Rapper Dappy backs Norman Lamb's bid for leadership of Lib Dems|last = Perraudin|first = Frances|date = 14 May 2015|work = The Guardian|access-date = 18 May 2015|via = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150524194327/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/rapper-dappy-backs-norman-lambs-bid-for-leadership-of-lib-dems|archive-date = 24 May 2015|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Dappy discography}}\n{{See also|N-Dubz discography}}\n*''[[Bad Intentions (album)|Bad Intentions]]'' (2012)\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Dappy}}\n{{N-Dubz}}\n{{Takeover Entertainment navbox|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dappy}}\n[[Category:1987 births]]\n[[Category:Rappers from London]]\n[[Category:People from the London Borough of Camden]]\n[[Category:Takeover Entertainment artists]]\n[[Category:English male rappers]]\n[[Category:English people of Greek Cypriot descent]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:English people convicted of assault]]\n[[Category:Island Records artists]]\n", "name_user": "Jontel", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCriticism and controversy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dappy"}
