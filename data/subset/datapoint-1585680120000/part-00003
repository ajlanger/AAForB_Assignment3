It was active from 1942 to 1976 under the Commander of the [[Fifth Naval District]], based in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].\n\nLocated on the appropriated campus of the [[Tome School]] for boys, the training center sat between various important naval centers of [[World War II]]: about {{convert|35|mi|km}} northeast of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and {{convert|75|mi|km}} from Washington, D.C., and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. It was reached via [[Maryland Route 222]], about halfway between [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US&nbsp;1]] and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US&nbsp;40]]. \n\n==History==\n===Origin===\nPresident [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] personally approved the site, which was seized from the [[Tome School]] by Congressional order. Roosevelt also chose the name to honor Commodore [[William Bainbridge]], who commanded the [[frigate]] [[USS Constitution|''Constitution'']] when it defeated the British frigate [[HMS Java (1811)|HMS ''Java'']] during the [[War of 1812]]. \n\nThe campus was expanded by government purchase from {{convert|330|acre|km2}} to {{convert|1132|acre|km2}}. More than five hundred new buildings were built, some designed by [[Eggers & Higgins]].\n\n===World War II===\n====Recruit training====\nThe center was activated on 1 October 1942, and the first batch of recruits arrived 10 days later to begin \"boot camp\" training. They came in busloads from transportation collection points at [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]] and [[Perryville, Maryland]]. The recruits were given a battery of tests to determine their educational and skill levels, then trained in ordnance and gunnery, seamanship, fire fighting, physical training, and military drill.\n\nRecruits were trained in shipboard duties aboard the [[USS Commodore (401B)|R.T.S. ''Commodore'']], a 200-foot \"ship\" built on dry land. The trainer was equipped with  deck guns, a [[pilot house]], [[davit]]s with [[whaleboat]]s, and mooring lines fastened to earth-bound [[bollard]]s, so that crew members could learn casting off [[hawser]]s and other lines connecting the ship to its dock.\n\nHalfway through boot camp, recruits had a \"service week\", which generally included kitchen duty, peeling potatoes, mopping, picking up cigarette butts, etc. Recruits with desirable skills, such as typing, could end up on an office typewriter rather than in a kitchen. One winter, recruits were sent to shovel snow off roads to a largely rural area near Colora and Rising Sun.{{cn|date=February 2014}}<!---probably needs deletion. Sounds like trivia-->\n\nBy the end of World War II, the center had trained 244,277 recruits who transferred to various ships and stations throughout the world.\n\n====Non-recruit training====\nUSNTC Bainbridge also trained new boot camp graduates and other sailors in technical and other skills. During World War II, a total of 24,484 sailors completed various programs under the direction of the Service School Command<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.net/hyperwar/USN/ref/USN-Act/MD.html United States Naval Facilities World War II]</ref>.These included:\n[[File:Building Overtaken.jpg|alt=A panoramic image showing a large \"H-shaped\" building overtaken by nature due to Bainbridge's abandoning.|thumb|A panoramic image showing a large \"H-shaped\" building being overtaken by nature due to Bainbridge's abandoning. ]]\n[[File:Workshop Brick Making.jpg|alt=A brick-making workshop that has been left to rot.|thumb|A brick-making workshop that has been left to rot.]]\n\n* Coast Guard School\n* Rockefeller Research Unit (Report to Naval Training Station).\n* Stewards Mates' School Roll\n*[[Naval Academy Preparatory School]], founded in 1943.\n* Naval Hospital\n* Hospital Corps School\n* Naval Training School (Radio)\n* Naval Training School (Fire Controlmen)\n* Fire Fighters School\n* Naval Training School (Electrical)\n* Naval Training School (Physical Instructors)\n* Naval Training School (Instructors)\n* Naval Training School (Sound Motion Picture Technician)\n* Fire Fighters Training Unit\n* Naval Training School (Motion Picture Operators)\n* Naval Training School (Recruit Instructors \u2013 C)\n\n===First deactivation===\nAfter the war ended, the center continued limited operations until 30 June 1947, when it was first inactivated as a Navy training center. The sole remaining training activity on campus was the Naval Academy Prep School. A maintenance staff remained active to protect the buildings from weather and other damage. \n\n===Reactivation ===\nIn mid-1950, with the advent of the [[Korean War]] crisis, plans were made to reactivate the center, and it was officially reopened on 1 February 1951, when Captain Robert Hall Smith took overall command.\n\nDespite the care of the maintenance staff, the buildings were in severe disrepair. A contract was awarded to Consolidated Engineering Company of [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. The necessary renovations and road work were accomplished ahead of schedule, and the center reopened its gates for recruits on 5 April 1951.\n\nInitially, the center admitted 500 recruits per week, but the rate soon doubled. The first 500 recruits who graduated as seamen recruits on 23 June 1951.\n\nIn 1962, a [[Naval Nuclear Power School]] was installed on the center; this was eventually moved to [[Naval Training Center Orlando]], Florida. \n\nNAPS moved to [[Newport, Rhode Island]], in August 1974.\n\n===Second deactivation===\nThe Navy formally deactivated the Center on March 31, 1976<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cecilcountyhistory.com/cecil-goes-on-a-war-footing-dec-7-1941/|title=Dec 7, 1941 - Cecil Goes on a War Footing & Bainbridge Develops|date=2008-12-07|website=Window on Cecil County's Past|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> and on the evening of June 30, 1976 the last sailor detailed to handle closing matters locked the gates for the final time.

Tasks included base maintenance, physical security, fire protection, logistics, material procurement, medical care, religious services, transportation, and so on.\n [[Image:USNTC Bainbridge graduation.jpg|300px|thumb|right|USNTC Bainbridge seaman recruits performing final graduation exercises (1954).]]\n[[Image:USNTC Bainbridge.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Typical barracks for enlisted personnel attending the Class \"A\" Radioman school (1954).]]\n\n===Recruit Training Command===\nThe Recruit Training Command was the largest of the center's commands and was responsible for the basic training of recruits.

A training school was established for [[WAVES|WAVE]] recruits in October 1951. Circa 1959, male recruit training at Bainbridge was closed and male recruit training was only in Great Lakes, Illinois and San Diego, California. Bainbridge was the sole recruit training center for Waves until moving to Orlando, Florida in 1972.\n\n===Service School Command===\nThe Service School Command was organized to train selected personnel who had completed \"recruit\" basic training and demonstrated an aptitude for a skill during initial recruit testing. The command had a capacity of providing specialty training to 4,000 sailors at a time. These personnel were assigned to training in gunnery, fire control, radio, telemetry, and other technical subjects.\n\nThe [[Naval Academy Preparatory School]] was a component of the Service School Command and was chartered to train enlisted personnel for acceptance into the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. The school also trained sailors and marines in necessary academic skills required for admission to colleges and universities under the [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps|Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]].\n\n===Naval Hospital===\nThe naval hospital was established as a 500-bed hospital to care for the center's operating staff, recruits, students, and dependents, with provision to increase capacity to 1,000 beds or more.
