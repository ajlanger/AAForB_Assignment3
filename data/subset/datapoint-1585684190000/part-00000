''F.s. silvestris'' which is the European wildcat, has a tendency to be very timid and aggressive even when they are raised starting as kittens around a human population. This group was also very territorial and showed aggressive behavior within their own species as well.

These studies were conducted using the same techniques as mentioned above for finding the common ancestor which were the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites. All cat breeds were found to have originated in eight different regions and then selectively bred multiple times throughout history and relocated multiple times leading to the approximately 45 modern breeds. These eight lineages include Europe, Egypt, India, Southeast Asia, Arabian Sea, East Asia and Mediterranean.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Genetic analysis of domestication patterns in the cat (Felis catus) : worldwide population structure, and human-mediated breeding patterns both modern and ancient|last=Kurushima, Jennifer Dawn|isbn=9781124907475|oclc=861518845|year=2011}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Felidae#Evolution|Felidae \u00a7 Evolution]]\n* [[Cat genetics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Evolution]]\n[[Category:Domesticated animals]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1700:4850:6c60:20bf:a929:f3db:42d1", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_domesticated_cat"}
