These opened as an [[orphanage]] for destitute children from the [[Manchester]] area in 1898. In 1956 this closed and the site re-opened as a women's prison in 1962, with women transferred from [[Manchester (HM Prison)|HMP Strangeways]]. \n\nFrom 1983 Styal began holding young offenders, and in 1999 a wing was added to accommodate unsentenced female prisoners following the closure of Risley's remand centre. This increased the size of the prison by 60%.\n\nIn June 2003, Styal Prison was singled out as having one of the worst records for suicides in England and Wales. The [[Howard League for Penal Reform]] called for an independent inquiry into the jail, stating that bullying, drugs and overcrowding were probable causes for the high number of deaths.<ref>{{cite web |title=Inquiry call for women's prison |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/2975134.stm |website=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]] |date=9 June 2003 |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2004, an inspection report from [[Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons]] stated that inmates at Styal Prison were being put at risk by a lack of support during drug withdrawal and with mental health problems.
