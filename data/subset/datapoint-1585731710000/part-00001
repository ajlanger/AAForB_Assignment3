In June 1830, when the King was dying, he eagerly seized her \"get well soon\" letter and, after reading it, placed it under his pillow.

Wilkins to open her vault at Coutts Bank in 1906.  The release of Wilkins' book later that year prompted several would-be descendants of the Prince and Fitzherbert to claim the latter's substantial estate.  A Rebecca Fitzherbert Harris of Kenvil, New Jersey, maintained that through family lore she was the great-granddaughter of the couple via a supposed son named Thomas Edward, after Fitzherbert's first two husbands.  In a letter to Edward VII, Harris claimed that Thomas also had a brother and sister who lived for a time with their mother in Dublin.  Thomas was supposedly sent to the United States in 1833 by Fitzherbert who thought her children would be safer there following her death.  Harris further stated that her family had received an income from an unknown source in the United Kingdom for many years.  Harris requested access to Fitzherbert's papers to pursue her claim of the estate.  Edward VII was noted to have acknowledged Harris' letter but stated that he would not assist her further.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= New York Woman Traces Descent to English King |curly= |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=LAH19060926.2.155&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1 |format= California Digital Newspaper Collection |agency=  |work= The Los Angeles Herald |publisher= Hearst Newspapers |location= Los Angeles, USA |id= |pages= |page= |date= 26 September 1906 |accessdate= 23 October 2019|language= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nThe second codicil to Maria Fitzherbert's will<ref>Will of Maria Fitzherbert, approved for probate 20 Apr 1837, The National Archives (UK), record PROB 1\u201386</ref> outlines her two principal beneficiaries, and includes a personal note, \"...this paper is addressed to my two dear children...

There is no evidence that either of these women were the natural children of Maria Fitzherbert \u2013 indeed the reference to 'the affection any mother could do' (with stress on mother) could indicate she only saw herself as a mother-figure to them, and no more. The will makes no reference to any sons, though this observation must be seen in its historic context; of the ten illegitimate children of [[Dorothea Jordan]], Irish actress and mistress of 20 years to the Duke of Clarence, care for the five boys was initially assumed by their father and his households, and custody and care for the girls given to Jordan.\n\nNotably, any such historical claim of descent is accompanied by controversy, and many of the preceding have been challenged.<ref name=\"A.J.

However, this did not lead to a reunion. The Prince finally sought a reconciliation with his \"second self\" during the summer of 1798. By then, he had separated from Caroline for good and was bored with his mistress, [[Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey]].\n\nDuring the first few years of his reign as King George IV, he turned violently against Fitzherbert and several of his former associates. Whenever he mentioned her name it was \"with feelings of disgust and horror\", claiming that their union \"was an artificial marriage\u2026 just to satisfy her; that it was no marriage \u2013 for there could be none without a licence or some written document.\" Fitzherbert was in possession of documents and after their final break her demands for her [[Life annuity|annuity]] payments were often accompanied by veiled threats to go public with her papers if she did not receive the funds. In June 1830, when the King was dying, he eagerly seized her \"get well soon\" letter and, after reading it, placed it under his pillow. Fitzherbert \u2013 who had no idea just how ill he was \u2013 was deeply hurt that he had never replied to her final letter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Leslie|title=A problem like Maria|page=20|url=http://lesliecarroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JARW_39_14-21-Maria-Fitzherbert-article-Carroll.pdf}}</ref>  However, before dying, the King asked to be buried with Fitzherbert's [[eye miniature]] around his neck, which was done.<ref name=\"Maria Fitzherbert\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=Hugh Ross|title=Who was the man in the iron mask?: and other historical mysteries|year=2002|publisher=Penguin Classics|isbn=0-14-139097-2|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpQbqEDGt-QC&pg=PA330 }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nFollowing the death of George IV on 26 June 1830, it was discovered that he had kept all of Fitzherbert's letters, and steps were taken to destroy them.

On Fitzherbert's death it is stated that her children were adopted by a Scottish family, named Wyatt, whose name they assumed. Afterwards they came south settling in Erith, Kent. The Wyatt family, in the person of J. G. Wyatt, a former Erith man who later moved to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada and Isabella Annie Wyatt claimed title to a portion of the Fitzherbert estate in 1937.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= Riches?

Wilkins to open her vault at Coutts Bank in 1906.  The release of Wilkins' book later that year prompted several would-be descendants of the Prince and Fitzherbert to claim the latter's substantial estate.  A Rebecca Fitzherbert Harris of Kenvil, New Jersey, maintained that through family lore she was the great-granddaughter of the couple via a supposed son named Thomas Edward, after Fitzherbert's first two husbands.  In a letter to Edward VII, Harris claimed that Thomas also had a brother and sister who lived for a time with their mother in Dublin.  Thomas was supposedly sent to the United States in 1833 by Fitzherbert who thought her children would be safer there following her death.  Harris further stated that her family had received an income from an unknown source in the United Kingdom for many years.  Harris requested access to Fitzherbert's papers to pursue her claim of the estate.  Edward VII was noted to have acknowledged Harris' letter but stated that he would not assist her further.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= New York Woman Traces Descent to English King |curly= |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=LAH19060926.2.155&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1 |format= California Digital Newspaper Collection |agency=  |work= The Los Angeles Herald |publisher= Hearst Newspapers |location= Los Angeles, USA |id= |pages= |page= |date= 26 September 1906 |accessdate= 23 October 2019|language= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nThe second codicil to Maria Fitzherbert's will<ref>Will of Maria Fitzherbert, approved for probate 20 Apr 1837, The National Archives (UK), record PROB 1\u201386</ref> outlines her two principal beneficiaries, and includes a personal note, \"...this paper is addressed to my two dear children...

Stafford-Jerningham was nominally Fitzherbert's 'niece', and was raised as Mary Ann Smythe. Dawson-Damer was nominally the daughter of Admiral [[Lord Hugh Seymour]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The peerage|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p10295.htm#i102942}}</ref> and Lady Anna Horatia Waldegrave. Seymour had been a close associate of George IV since their youth, and Seymour's son [[George Seymour (Royal Navy officer)|George]] was an executor and minor beneficiary of Fitzherbert's will. There is no evidence that either of these women were the natural children of Maria Fitzherbert \u2013 indeed the reference to 'the affection any mother could do' (with stress on mother) could indicate she only saw herself as a mother-figure to them, and no more. The will makes no reference to any sons, though this observation must be seen in its historic context; of the ten illegitimate children of [[Dorothea Jordan]], Irish actress and mistress of 20 years to the Duke of Clarence, care for the five boys was initially assumed by their father and his households, and custody and care for the girls given to Jordan.\n\nNotably, any such historical claim of descent is accompanied by controversy, and many of the preceding have been challenged.<ref name=\"A.J.
