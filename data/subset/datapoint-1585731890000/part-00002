The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' mentions a marketplace named ''Poduke'' (ch 60). [[G. W. B. Huntingford]] suggested this might be a site about 2 miles from the modern Puducherry, which was possibly the location of [[Arikamedu]] (now part of [[Ariyankuppam]]). Huntingford noted that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937. In addition, [[archeology|archaeological]] excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was \"a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century\" Subsequent investigation by Vimala Begley from 1989 to 1992 modified this assessment, and now place the period of occupation from the third or second century BC to the eighth century AD.<ref>\n{{cite web | title=The Dating of Arikamedu and its Bearing on the Archaeology of Early Historical South India | author=Vimala Begley | url=http://utilisateurs.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~chevilla/FestSchrift/V_Beg_3x.pdf | access-date=1 January 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101100834/http://utilisateurs.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~chevilla/FestSchrift/V_Beg_3x.pdf | archive-date=1 January 2019 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoZwPQAACAAJ|date=July 2007|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-548-20943-1|page=119|access-date=15 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517054619/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoZwPQAACAAJ|archive-date=17 May 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1674, the municipality of Pondicherry (Pondich\u00e9ry) became a French colony of the [[French colonial empire]]. Together with [[Chandannagar|Chandernagor]] (already French since 1673), [[Mah\u00e9, Puducherry|Mah\u00e9]] (since 1721), [[Yanam]] ([[Yanaon]]) (since 1731), [[Karaikal]] (Karikal) (since 1739) and [[Masulipatam]] (1760), it formed the French colony of [[French India]], under a single French governor in Pondicherry, although French rule over one or more of these enclaves was repeatedly interrupted by [[United Kingdom|British]] occupations. The territories of [[French India]] were completely transferred to the Republic of India de facto on 1 November 1954, and de jure on 16 August 1962, when French India ceased to exist, becoming the present Indian constituent union territory of Pondicherry, combining four coastal enclaves (with the exception of [[Chandannagar|Chandernagor]], which merged with the state of [[West Bengal]] in 1954).\n\n==Geography==\n{{further|List of rivers of Puducherry}}\nThe Union Territory of Puducherry consists of [[List of districts of Puducherry|four small unconnected districts]]: [[Puducherry district]] ({{cvt|293|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}), [[Karaikal district]] ({{cvt|161|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) and [[Yanam district]] ({{cvt|20|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) on the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[Mah\u00e9 district]] ({{cvt|9|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) on the [[Laccadive Sea]], covering a total area of {{cvt|483|sqkm|sqmi}}. Puducherry and Karaikal have the largest areas and population, and are both [[enclaves]] of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Yanam and Mah\u00e9 are enclaves of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Kerala]], respectively. Its population, as per the [[2011 Census of India|2011 Census]], is 1,244,464.\n\nSome of Puducherry's regions are themselves amalgamations of non-contiguous enclaves, often called \"pockets\" in India. The Puducherry region is made of 11 such pockets, some of which are very small and entirely surrounded by the territory of Tamil Nadu. Mah\u00e9 region is made up of three pockets. This unusual geography is a legacy of the [[Colonialism|colonial period]] with Puducherry retaining the borders of former [[French India]].\n\nAll four regions of Puducherry are located in the coastal region. Five rivers in [[Puducherry district]], seven in [[Karaikal district]], two in [[Mah\u00e9 district]] and one in [[Yanam district]] drain into the sea, but none originates within the territory.\n\n===Districts of Union Territory of Puducherry===\n[[File:Puducherry Map.svg|thumb|Map showing the districts of Puducherry]]\n* [[Puducherry district]] is an enclave of [[Tamil Nadu]].\n* [[Mah\u00e9 district]] is an enclave of [[Kerala]].\n* [[Yanam district]] is an enclave of [[Andhra Pradesh]].\n* [[Karaikal district]] is an enclave of [[Tamil Nadu]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=2,46,354|13=1911|14=2,57,179|15=1921|16=2,44,156|17=1931|18=2,58,628|19=1941|20=2,85,011|21=1951|22=3,17,253|23=1961|24=3,69,079|25=1971|26=4,71,707|27=1981|28=6,04,471|29=1991|30=8,07,785|31=2001|32=9,74,345|33=2011|34=12,47,953|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Puducherry\n|label1 = [[Hinduism]]\n|color1 = Orange\n|value1 = 87.3\n|label2 = [[Christianity]]\n|color2 = DodgerBlue\n|value2 = 6.2\n|label3 = [[Islam]]\n|color3 = Green\n|value3 = 6\n}}\n\n[[Hinduism]] is the major religion with 87.3% of the population adhering to it.

The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' mentions a marketplace named ''Poduke'' (ch 60). [[G. W. B. Huntingford]] suggested this might be a site about 2 miles from the modern Puducherry, which was possibly the location of [[Arikamedu]] (now part of [[Ariyankuppam]]). Huntingford noted that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937. In addition, [[archeology|archaeological]] excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was \"a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century\" Subsequent investigation by Vimala Begley from 1989 to 1992 modified this assessment, and now place the period of occupation from the third or second century BC to the eighth century AD.<ref>\n{{cite web | title=The Dating of Arikamedu and its Bearing on the Archaeology of Early Historical South India | author=Vimala Begley | url=http://utilisateurs.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~chevilla/FestSchrift/V_Beg_3x.pdf | access-date=1 January 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101100834/http://utilisateurs.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~chevilla/FestSchrift/V_Beg_3x.pdf | archive-date=1 January 2019 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoZwPQAACAAJ|date=July 2007|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-548-20943-1|page=119|access-date=15 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517054619/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoZwPQAACAAJ|archive-date=17 May 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1674, the municipality of Pondicherry (Pondich\u00e9ry) became a French colony of the [[French colonial empire]]. Together with [[Chandannagar|Chandernagor]] (already French since 1673), [[Mah\u00e9, Puducherry|Mah\u00e9]] (since 1721), [[Yanam]] ([[Yanaon]]) (since 1731), [[Karaikal]] (Karikal) (since 1739) and [[Masulipatam]] (1760), it formed the French colony of [[French India]], under a single French governor in Pondicherry, although French rule over one or more of these enclaves was repeatedly interrupted by [[United Kingdom|British]] occupations. The territories of [[French India]] were completely transferred to the Republic of India de facto on 1 November 1954, and de jure on 16 August 1962, when French India ceased to exist, becoming the present Indian constituent union territory of Pondicherry, combining four coastal enclaves (with the exception of [[Chandannagar|Chandernagor]], which merged with the state of [[West Bengal]] in 1954).\n\n==Geography==\n{{further|List of rivers of Puducherry}}\nThe Union Territory of Puducherry consists of [[List of districts of Puducherry|four small unconnected districts]]: [[Puducherry district]] ({{cvt|293|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}), [[Karaikal district]] ({{cvt|161|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) and [[Yanam district]] ({{cvt|20|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) on the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[Mah\u00e9 district]] ({{cvt|9|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) on the [[Laccadive Sea]], covering a total area of {{cvt|483|sqkm|sqmi}}. Puducherry and Karaikal have the largest areas and population, and are both [[enclaves]] of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Yanam and Mah\u00e9 are enclaves of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Kerala]], respectively. Its population, as per the [[2011 Census of India|2011 Census]], is 1,244,464.\n\nSome of Puducherry's regions are themselves amalgamations of non-contiguous enclaves, often called \"pockets\" in India. The Puducherry region is made of 11 such pockets, some of which are very small and entirely surrounded by the territory of Tamil Nadu. Mah\u00e9 region is made up of three pockets. This unusual geography is a legacy of the [[Colonialism|colonial period]] with Puducherry retaining the borders of former [[French India]].\n\nAll four regions of Puducherry are located in the coastal region.

However, Puducherry is one of the three union territories in India (the other being [[National Capital Territory of Delhi|Delhi]] and Jammu & Kashmir) that is entitled by a [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of India|special constitutional amendment]] to have an elected legislative assembly and a cabinet of ministers, thereby conveying partial statehood.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lankabbc.com/blog/tag/pondicherry |title=Lanka BBC Info Know Puducherry: Government Name Pondicherry As Puducherry |website=lankabbc.com |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2017-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202235835/https://lankabbc.com/blog/tag/pondicherry/ |archive-date=2 February 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Centre is represented by the [[List of lieutenant governors of Puducherry|Lieutenant Governor]], who resides at the Raj Nivas (Le Palais du Gouverneur) at the Park, the former palace of the French governor.
