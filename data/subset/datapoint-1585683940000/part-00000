The appearance of the granulomas differs according to the precise type of leprosy.\n\n===Schistosomiasis===\nSome [[schistosome]] ova that are laid in intestinal and urinary venules backwash into the liver via the portal vein causing granuloma formation in the liver.\n\n===Histoplasmosis===\nGranulomas are seen in most forms of [[histoplasmosis]] (acute histoplasmosis, histoplasmoma, chronic histoplasmosis). ''Histoplasma'' organisms can sometimes be demonstrated within the granulomas by biopsy or microbiological cultures.<ref name=\"Muk7\" />\n\n===Cryptococcosis===\nWhen ''[[Cryptococcus (fungus)|Cryptococcus]]'' infection occurs in persons whose immune systems are intact, granulomatous inflammation is typically encountered. The granulomas can be necrotizing or non-necrotizing. Using a microscope and appropriate stains, organisms can be seen within the granulomas.<ref name=\"Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA. 2010 669\u2013690\"/>\n\n===Cat-scratch disease===\n[[Cat-scratch disease]] is an infection caused by the bacterial organism ''Bartonella henselae'', typically acquired by a scratch from a kitten infected with the organism. The granulomas in this disease are found in the lymph nodes draining the site of the scratch. They are characteristically \"suppurative\", i.e., [[pus]] forming, containing large numbers of neutrophils. Organisms are usually difficult to find within the granulomas using methods routinely used in pathology laboratories.\n\n===Rheumatic Fever===\nRheumatic fever is a systemic disease affecting the peri-arteriolar connective tissue and can occur after an untreated Group A Beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal infection.

Other common sites of involvement include the liver, spleen, skin and eyes. The granulomas of [[sarcoidosis]] are similar to the granulomas of tuberculosis and other infectious granulomatous diseases. However, in most cases of sarcoidosis, the granulomas do not contain necrosis and are surrounded by concentric scar tissue ([[fibrosis]]). Sarcoid granulomas often contain star-shaped structures termed [[asteroid bodies]] or [[lamellar]] structures termed [[Schaumann bodies]]. However, these structures are not specific for sarcoidosis.<ref name=\"Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA. 2010 669\u2013690\"/> Sarcoid granulomas can resolve spontaneously without complications or heal with residual scarring. In the lungs, this scarring can cause a condition known as [[pulmonary fibrosis]] that impairs breathing. In the heart, it can lead to rhythm disturbances, heart failure, and even death.\n\n===Crohn's disease===\n[[Crohn's disease]] is an inflammatory condition of uncertain cause characterized by severe inflammation in the wall of the intestines and other parts of the abdomen.

However, granulomas may form when food particles or other particulate substances like pill fragments are aspirated into the lungs. Patients typically aspirate food because they have esophageal, gastric or neurologic problems. Intake of drugs that depress neurologic function may also lead to aspiration. The resultant granulomas are typically found around the airways (bronchioles) and are often accompanied by foreign-body-type multinucleated giant cells, acute inflammation or organizing pneumonia.

The identification of necrosis in granulomas is important because granulomas with necrosis tend to have infectious causes.<ref name=\"Muk7\" /> There are several exceptions to this general rule, but it nevertheless remains useful in day-to-day diagnostic pathology.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Necrosis in granulomas\" widths=\"300px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:Granuloma 20x.jpg|Granuloma without necrosis in a lymph node of a person with sarcoidosis.\nImage:Necrogran10x.jpg|Granuloma with central necrosis in a lung of a person with tuberculosis.

Langhans-type giant cells are seen in many types of granulomas, and are not specific for tuberculosis.\n</gallery>\n\n==Diseases with granulomas==\n\n===Tuberculosis===\nThe granulomas of [[tuberculosis]] tend to contain [[necrosis]] (\"caseating tubercules\"), but non-necrotizing granulomas may also be present. Multinucleated giant cells with nuclei arranged like a horseshoe ([[Langhans giant cell]]) and foreign body giant cells<ref>dental decks part II Edited by Nour</ref> are often present, but are not specific for tuberculosis. A definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis requires identification of the causative organism by microbiologic cultures.<ref name=\"Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA. 2010 669\u2013690\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA |title=Granulomatous lung disease: an approach to the differential diagnosis  |journal=Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=669&ndash;690 |year=2010 |pmid=20441499 |doi= 10.1043/1543-2165-134.5.667|doi-broken-date=2020-01-14 |url=https://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/full/10.1043/1543-2165-134.5.667 }}</ref>\n\n===Leprosy===\nIn [[leprosy]], granulomas are found in the skin and tend to involve nerves. The appearance of the granulomas differs according to the precise type of leprosy.\n\n===Schistosomiasis===\nSome [[schistosome]] ova that are laid in intestinal and urinary venules backwash into the liver via the portal vein causing granuloma formation in the liver.\n\n===Histoplasmosis===\nGranulomas are seen in most forms of [[histoplasmosis]] (acute histoplasmosis, histoplasmoma, chronic histoplasmosis). ''Histoplasma'' organisms can sometimes be demonstrated within the granulomas by biopsy or microbiological cultures.<ref name=\"Muk7\" />\n\n===Cryptococcosis===\nWhen ''[[Cryptococcus (fungus)|Cryptococcus]]'' infection occurs in persons whose immune systems are intact, granulomatous inflammation is typically encountered. The granulomas can be necrotizing or non-necrotizing. Using a microscope and appropriate stains, organisms can be seen within the granulomas.<ref name=\"Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA. 2010 669\u2013690\"/>\n\n===Cat-scratch disease===\n[[Cat-scratch disease]] is an infection caused by the bacterial organism ''Bartonella henselae'', typically acquired by a scratch from a kitten infected with the organism. The granulomas in this disease are found in the lymph nodes draining the site of the scratch. They are characteristically \"suppurative\", i.e., [[pus]] forming, containing large numbers of neutrophils. Organisms are usually difficult to find within the granulomas using methods routinely used in pathology laboratories.\n\n===Rheumatic Fever===\nRheumatic fever is a systemic disease affecting the peri-arteriolar connective tissue and can occur after an untreated Group A Beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal infection. It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity.\n\n===Sarcoidosis===\n[[Image:Asteroid bodies high mag cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[asteroid bodies]] in [[sarcoidosis]].

Other common sites of involvement include the liver, spleen, skin and eyes. The granulomas of [[sarcoidosis]] are similar to the granulomas of tuberculosis and other infectious granulomatous diseases. However, in most cases of sarcoidosis, the granulomas do not contain necrosis and are surrounded by concentric scar tissue ([[fibrosis]]). Sarcoid granulomas often contain star-shaped structures termed [[asteroid bodies]] or [[lamellar]] structures termed [[Schaumann bodies]]. However, these structures are not specific for sarcoidosis.<ref name=\"Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA. 2010 669\u2013690\"/> Sarcoid granulomas can resolve spontaneously without complications or heal with residual scarring. In the lungs, this scarring can cause a condition known as [[pulmonary fibrosis]] that impairs breathing. In the heart, it can lead to rhythm disturbances, heart failure, and even death.\n\n===Crohn's disease===\n[[Crohn's disease]] is an inflammatory condition of uncertain cause characterized by severe inflammation in the wall of the intestines and other parts of the abdomen. Within the inflammation in the gut wall, granulomas are often found and are a clue to the diagnosis.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/06/11/teen.self.diagnosis/ | title = Teen diagnoses her own disease in science class | date = June 11, 2009 | first = Elizabeth | last = Cohen | newspaper = CNN Health | publisher = Cable News Network}}</ref>\n\n===''Listeria monocytogenes''===\n''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'' infection in infants can cause potentially fatal disseminated granulomas, called granulomatosis infantiseptica, following ''in utero'' infection.\n\n=== ''Leishmania'' spp ===\nLeishmaniases are a group of human diseases caused by ''Leishmania'' genus and transmitted by a sandfly bite can lead to granulomatous inflammation<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ridley|first=M.

However, granulomas may form when food particles or other particulate substances like pill fragments are aspirated into the lungs. Patients typically aspirate food because they have esophageal, gastric or neurologic problems. Intake of drugs that depress neurologic function may also lead to aspiration. The resultant granulomas are typically found around the airways (bronchioles) and are often accompanied by foreign-body-type multinucleated giant cells, acute inflammation or organizing pneumonia. The finding of food particles in lung biopsies is diagnostic.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mukhopadhyay S, Katzenstein AL |title=Pulmonary disease due to aspiration of food and other particulate matter: a clinicopathologic study of 59 cases diagnosed on biopsy or resection specimens |journal=American Journal of Surgical Pathology |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=752&ndash;759 |year=2007 |pmid=17460460 |doi= 10.1097/01.pas.0000213418.08009.f9|url=}}</ref>\n\n===Rheumatoid arthritis===\nNecrotizing granulomas can develop in patients with [[rheumatoid arthritis]], typically manifesting as bumps in the soft tissues around the joints (so-called rheumatoid nodules) or in the lungs.<ref name=\"Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA. 2010 669\u2013690\"/>\n\n===Granuloma annulare===\n[[Granuloma annulare]] is a skin disease of unknown cause in which granulomas are found in the dermis of the skin. However, it is not a true granuloma.
