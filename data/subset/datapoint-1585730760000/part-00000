Some of his works derive their material from chromatically saturated harmonic patterns that combine chords, melodies and motivic ideas that complete the chromatic scale within given sections of works. Formally, some of Paterson's works are highly episodic, such as his \"Sextet\" and \"Hell's Kitchen\", while others are more seamless, such as \"Dark Mountains\" for orchestra, \"A Dream Within A Dream\" for a cappella choir or \"Deep Blue Ocean\" for two pianos.\n\nPaterson's music is generally very colorful, and he incorporates extended techniques in many of his works, such as \"Scorpion Tales\" for two harps, \"The Book of Goddesses\" for flute, harp and percussion, \"Komodo\" and \"Piranha\" for solo marimba and \"Eating Variations\" for baritone and chamber ensemble.

Described by the press as \"an amazingly colorful tone poem\",<ref name=\"vttoday.com\"/> \"A New Eaarth\" consists of alternating sections of pure orchestral music, narration, and sections for orchestra and chorus (these excerpted choral movements also exist as a work for a choir and piano entitled \"Suite from A New Eaarth\"). The work addresses climate change and is divided into four main sections, each section centered on one of the four [[classical elements]] and how they relate to environmental disasters such as flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes and forest fires, all thought to be exacerbated by climate change. The text for this work consists of narrative text by Paterson based on statements and statistics in McKibben's book,<ref name=\"vttoday.com\"/> as well as poems by [[Wendell Berry]], [[James Joyce]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelly]] and [[William Wordsworth]] and well-known quotes and aphorisms.\n\n==Selected Awards and Recognition==\n* (2018) A.I.

While teaching, Paterson began working on a variety of commissions for ensembles such as [[Quintet of The Americas]], [[The California EAR Unit]] and [[Volti]].

As a percussionist, Paterson spent many years developing a six-mallet technique based on the Burton grip. He developed this technique while studying with John Beck at the Eastman School of Music, where he presented the world's first all six-mallet marimba recital.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newmusicusa.org/profile/robert-paterson/|title=Robert Paterson - New Music USA|work=newmusicusa.org}}</ref> As well as composing his own six-mallet works, he has \"been instrumental in the commissioning of six-mallet works for solo marimba\" and has to date, written fourteen works using a six-mallet technique ([[extended technique]]) he developed.<ref>Jones, Timothy, A Survey of Artists and Literature Employing Extended Multiple Mallets in Keyboard Percussion; Its Evolution, Resulting Techniques and Pedagogical Guide, Doctoral Dissertation, College of Fine Arts, Graduate College, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, August 2003, p. 15.</ref> His recording [http://amzn.com/B009AFXUCG Six Mallet Marimba] is the first all six-mallet marimba album ever released, and contains many of Paterson's six-mallet marimba compositions.

Some of his works derive their material from chromatically saturated harmonic patterns that combine chords, melodies and motivic ideas that complete the chromatic scale within given sections of works. Formally, some of Paterson's works are highly episodic, such as his \"Sextet\" and \"Hell's Kitchen\", while others are more seamless, such as \"Dark Mountains\" for orchestra, \"A Dream Within A Dream\" for a cappella choir or \"Deep Blue Ocean\" for two pianos.\n\nPaterson's music is generally very colorful, and he incorporates extended techniques in many of his works, such as \"Scorpion Tales\" for two harps, \"The Book of Goddesses\" for flute, harp and percussion, \"Komodo\" and \"Piranha\" for solo marimba and \"Eating Variations\" for baritone and chamber ensemble. He also occasionally uses [[found object]]s, such as in his work \"Hell's Kitchen\" which calls for kitchen utensils, pots and pans, and even a kitchen sink.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nMany of his works also use bell sounds, and Paterson has said, \"I am fascinated with resonance, and how notes ring.

Many composers admit that they do not care to write \u2018funny\u2019 music. It seems as if they think they are in danger of being considered trivial or not serious if they embrace humor.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nPaterson has spent a good part of his career composing vocal works. Although he has set numerous poems by poets such as [[Wallace Stevens]] and [[Robert Creeley]],<ref>da Fonseca-Wollheim, Corinna, Robert Paterson: \u2018Winter Songs and Other Vocal Works\u2019, The New York Times, December 11, 2013</ref> he has also set a myriad of diverse, alternative texts, such as fictitious answering machine messages (\"Thursday\" for soprano and piano), onomatopoeia words (\"The Essence of Gravity\" for a cappella choir), and even nursery rhymes (\"Life is But a Dream\" for a cappella choir). One of these works, \"CAPTCHA\" for baritone and piano, \"...derives its lyrics from the two-word answers to [[reCAPTCHA]] puzzles. The lyrics are a combination of words, numbers and fragments of words and nonsense.\"<ref>Author Unknown, Techman Texts: From passwords to piece of music, Pittsburgh Post Gazette, December 2, 2013.</ref>\n\nWithin his vocal output, one of his primary works is the [[climate change]] inspired \"A New Eaarth\" for orchestra, chorus and narrator, commissioned by the Vermont Youth Orchestra Association, and inspired by [[Eaarth]] by [[Bill McKibben]], who narrated at the premiere. Described by the press as \"an amazingly colorful tone poem\",<ref name=\"vttoday.com\"/> \"A New Eaarth\" consists of alternating sections of pure orchestral music, narration, and sections for orchestra and chorus (these excerpted choral movements also exist as a work for a choir and piano entitled \"Suite from A New Eaarth\"). The work addresses climate change and is divided into four main sections, each section centered on one of the four [[classical elements]] and how they relate to environmental disasters such as flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes and forest fires, all thought to be exacerbated by climate change. The text for this work consists of narrative text by Paterson based on statements and statistics in McKibben's book,<ref name=\"vttoday.com\"/> as well as poems by [[Wendell Berry]], [[James Joyce]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelly]] and [[William Wordsworth]] and well-known quotes and aphorisms.\n\n==Selected Awards and Recognition==\n* (2018) A.I.
