It is larger and has a wider selection than earlier [[grocery store]]s, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a [[hypermarket]] or [[Big-box store|big-box market]].\n\nThe supermarket typically has aisles for meat, fresh [[produce]], dairy, and baked goods. \nShelf space is also reserved for canned and packaged goods and for various non-food items such as kitchenware, household cleaners, pharmacy products and pet supplies.  Some supermarkets also sell other household products that are consumed regularly, such as alcohol (where permitted), medicine, and [[clothing|clothes]], and some sell a much wider range of non-food products: DVDs, sporting equipment, board games, and seasonal items (e.g., Christmas wrapping paper in December).\n\nA larger full-service supermarket combined with a [[department store]] is sometimes known as a [[hypermarket]]. Other services may include those of [[bank]]s, [[Coffeehouses|caf\u00e9s]], [[Day care|childcare centres/creches]], [[insurance]] (and other financial services), [[Mobile Phone]] services, [[Photographic processing|photo processing]], [[video rental]]s, [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] or [[petrol station]]s.  If the eatery in a supermarket is substantial enough, the facility may be called a \"grocerant\", a blend of \"grocery\" and \"restaurant\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/04/05/grocerants-take-bite-out-restaurants/99723098/\n |title=Why 'Grocerants' are the new trend, taking bite out of restaurants\n |last=Meyer|first=Zlati|date=5 April 2017|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=6 April 2017\n |quote=The phenomenon is growing fast enough both in prevalence and sophistication that the food industry has coined a name for these combination grocery stores and eateries &ndash; the 'grocerant.'}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional supermarket occupies a large amount of floor space, usually on a single level. It is usually situated near a residential area in order to be convenient to consumers. The basic appeal is the availability of a broad selection of goods under a single roof, at relatively low prices. Other advantages include ease of parking and frequently the convenience of shopping hours that extend into the evening or even 24 hours of the day. Supermarkets usually allocate large budgets to advertising, typically through newspapers.  They also present elaborate in-shop displays of products.\n\nSupermarkets typically are [[chain store]]s, supplied by the [[distribution center]]s of their [[parent company|parent companies]] thus increasing opportunities for [[economies of scale]].  Supermarkets usually offer products at relatively low prices by using their buying power to buy goods from manufacturers at lower prices than smaller stores can.  They also minimise financing costs by paying for goods at least 30 days after receipt and some extract credit terms of 90 days or more from vendors.  Certain products (typically [[staple foods]] such as [[bread]], [[milk]] and [[sugar]]) are very occasionally sold as [[loss leader]]s so as to attract shoppers to their store.  Supermarkets make up for their low margins by a high volume of sales, and with of higher-margin items bought by the attracted shoppers. [[Self-service]] with [[shopping cart]]s (trolleys) or baskets reduces [[Direct labor cost|labor cost]], and many supermarket chains are attempting further reduction by shifting to [[self-checkout|self-service check-out]].\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}\n[[File:Astor Market meat counter in Manhattan in 1915.jpg|thumb|Astor Market in New York, one predecessor of the modern super market operated in 1915\u20131917.]]\n[[File:SB-butik 1941.jpg|thumb|A supermarket in Sweden in 1941]]\n[[File:EmpressWalkLoblaws-Vivid.jpg|thumb|Consumers shopping for produce and fruit.]]\n\nIn the early days of retailing, products generally were fetched by an assistant from shelves behind the merchant's counter while customers waited in front of the counter and indicated the items they wanted.  Most foods and merchandise did not come in individually wrapped consumer-sized packages, so an assistant had to measure out and wrap the precise amount desired by the consumer.  This offered opportunities for social interaction: many regarded this style of shopping as \"a social occasion\" and would often \"pause for conversations with the staff or other customers\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Supermarket security system supplier|url=http://www.dragon-guard.com/|website=Dragon Guard Inc.|accessdate=10 January 2018}} {{Failed verification|date=January 2018}}</ref>  These practices were by nature slow and [[labor intensity|labor-intensive]] and therefore also quite expensive.  The number of customers who could be attended to at one time was limited by the number of staff employed in the store. Shopping for groceries also often involved trips to multiple specialty shops, such as a [[greengrocer]], butcher, bakery, fishmonger and [[dry goods]] store; in addition to a [[general store]]. Milk and other items of short [[shelf life]] were delivered by a [[milkman]]. \n\nThe concept of an inexpensive food market relying on large economies of scale was developed by [[Vincent Astor]].  He founded the Astor Market in 1915, investing $750,000 ($18 million in 2015 currency) of his fortune into a 165' by 125' (50x38 metre) corner of 95th and Broadway, [[Manhattan]], creating, in effect, an open-air mini-mall that sold meat, fruit, produce and flowers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Opening of the Astor market, New York City, 1915|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c06967/|website=[[Library of Congress]]|year=1915}}</ref>  The expectation was that customers would come from great distances (\"miles around\"), but in the end, even attracting people from ten blocks away was difficult, and the market folded in 1917.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Western Fruit Jobber|volume=IV|title=The Retailer|issue=3|date=July 1917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRMkAQAAIAAJ&dq=%22astor%20market%22&pg=RA2-PA52#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=The Astor Legacy in Brick and Stone|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=10 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=Streetscapes: Thalia Theater; a closed revival house that may itself be revived|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=5 July 1987|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/realestate/streetscapes-thalia-theater-a-closed-revival-house-that-may-itself-be-revived.html}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of a self-service grocery store was developed by [[entrepreneur]] [[Clarence Saunders (grocer)|Clarence Saunders]] and his [[Piggly Wiggly]] stores. His first store opened in 1916. Saunders was awarded a number of [[patent]]s for the ideas he incorporated into his stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1242872A/en|title=Self-serving store.|author=|date=|website=google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1407680A/en|title=Lighting system for self-serving stores|author=|date=|website=google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1704061A/en|title=Self-serving store|author=|date=|website=google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1647889A/en|title=Arrangement and construction of store fixtures|author=|date=|website=google.com}}</ref> The stores were a financial success and Saunders began to offer franchises. [[The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company]], which was established in 1859, was another successful early grocery store chain in [[Canada]] and the United States, and became common in North American cities in the 1920s. Early self-service grocery stores did not sell fresh meats or produce. Combination stores that sold perishable items were developed in the 1920s.<ref>Strasser, Susan ''Never Done: A History of American Housework'' Holt Paperbacks, 2000.\n\nThe general trend since then has been to stock shelves at night so that customers, the following day, can obtain their own goods and bring them to the front of the store to pay for them. Although there is a higher risk of [[shoplifting]], the costs of appropriate security measures ideally will be outweighed by reduced labor costs.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} </ref>\n\nHistorically, there has been debate about the origin of the supermarket, with [[King Kullen]] and [[Ralphs]] of [[California]] having strong claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.groceteria.com/store/regional-chains/p-t/ralphs/|title=Ralphs Grocery Company|author=|date=5 February 2009|website=groceteria.com}}</ref> Other contenders included [[Weingarten's|Weingarten's Big Food Markets]] and [[Henke & Pillot]].<ref>''Supermarket News'', 29 August 2005, p. 10</ref> To end the debate, the [[Food Marketing Institute]] in conjunction with the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and with funding from [[H.J. Heinz]], researched the issue.  They defined the attributes of a supermarket as \"self-service, separate product departments, discount pricing, marketing and volume selling\".{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThey determined that the first true supermarket in the United States was opened by a former [[Kroger]] employee, [[Michael J. Cullen]], on 4 August 1930, inside a {{convert|6000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} former garage in [[Jamaica, Queens]] in [[New York City]].<ref>Anonymous, \"The place where supermarketing was born,\" ''Mass Market Retailers'' 19, no. 9 (17 June 2002): 172.</ref>  The store, King Kullen, operated under the slogan \"Pile it high. Sell it low.\" At the time of Cullen's death in 1936, there were seventeen King Kullen stores in operation. Although Saunders had brought the world self-service, uniform stores, and nationwide marketing, Cullen built on this idea by adding separate food departments, selling large volumes of food at discount prices and adding a parking lot.\n\n[[File:Safeway50s.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] advertisement from the 1950s]]\nOther established American grocery chains in the 1930s, such as Kroger and [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] at first resisted Cullen's idea, but eventually were forced to build their own supermarkets as the economy sank into the [[Great Depression]], while consumers were becoming price-sensitive at a level never experienced before.<ref>Ryan Mathews, \"1926\u20131936: Entrepreneurs and Enterprise: A Look at Industry Pioneers like King Kullen and J. Frank Grimes, and the Institution They Created (Special Report: Social Change & the Supermarket),\" ''Progressive Grocer'' 75, no. 12 (December 1996): 39\u201343.</ref> Kroger took the idea one step further and pioneered the first supermarket surrounded on all four sides by a [[parking lot]].{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nAs larger chain supermarkets began to dominate the market in the US, able to supply consumers with the desired lower prices as opposed to the smaller \"mom and pop\" stands with considerably more overhead costs, the backlash of this infrastructure alteration was seen through numerous anti-chain campaigns. The idea of \"monopsony\", proposed by Cambridge economist Joan Robinson in 1933, that a single buyer could out-power the market of multiple sellers, became a strong anti-chain rhetorical device. With public backlash came political pressure to even the playing field for smaller vendors without the luxuries of economies of scale. In 1936, the [[Robinson-Patman Act]] was implemented as a way of preventing such larger chains from using this buying power to reap advantages over smaller stores, although the act was not well enforced and did not have much impact on the prevention of larger chains overtaking power in the markets.<ref>Hamilton, Shane ''Supermarkets, Free markets, and the Problem of Buying Power in the Postwar United States,'' in What's Good For Business: Business and Politics Since World War II, ed.

Most North American supermarkets are located in suburban [[strip mall|strip shopping center]]s as an anchor store along. They are generally regional rather than national in their company [[brand]]ing. Kroger is perhaps the most nationally oriented supermarket chain in the United States but it has preserved most of its regional brands, including [[Ralphs]], [[King Soopers#City Market|City Market]], [[King Soopers#King Soopers|King Soopers]], [[Fry's Food and Drug|Fry's]], [[Smith's Food and Drug|Smith's]], and [[QFC]].{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n[[File:Valdai town asv2018-07 img32 Truda33 Pyaterochka.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pyaterochka]] supermarket in Valday, Russia]]\nIn Canada, the largest such company is [[Loblaw]], which operates stores under a variety of banners targeted to different segments and regions, including [[Fortinos]], [[Zehrs]], [[No Frills (grocery store)|No Frills]], the Real Canadian Superstore, and Loblaws, the foundation of the company.

Other chains caught on, and after Galvani lost out to Tesco's [[Jack Cohen (businessman)|Jack Cohen]] in 1960 to buy the 212 Irwin's chain, the sector underwent a large amount of consolidation, resulting in 'the big four' dominant UK of today: [[Tesco]], [[Asda]] (owned by [[Wal-Mart]]), [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Morrisons]].\n\nIn the 1950s, supermarkets frequently issued [[trading stamp]]s as incentives to customers. Today, most chains issue store-specific \"membership cards\", \"club cards\", or \"[[loyalty card]]s\". These typically enable the cardholder to receive special members-only discounts on certain items when the credit card-like device is scanned at check-out.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mauri|first=Chiara|date=2003|title=Card loyalty.

With growth, has come considerable competition and some amount of consolidation.<ref>Thomas Reardon, Peter Timmer and Julio Berdegue, 2004.

''Journal of Agricultural and Development Economics'', Vol 1 No 2.</ref> The growth has been driven by increasing affluence and the rise of a middle class; the entry of women into the workforce; with a consequent incentive to seek out easy-to-prepare foods; the growth in the use of refrigerators, making it possible to shop weekly instead of daily; and the growth in car ownership, facilitating journeys to distant stores and purchases of large quantities of goods. The opportunities presented by this potential have encouraged several European companies to invest in these markets (mainly in Asia) and American companies to invest in Latin America and China. Local companies also entered the market.<ref>Reardon et al, op cit</ref> Initial development of supermarkets has now been followed by hypermarket growth. In addition there were investments by companies such as [[Makro]] and [[Metro Cash and Carry|Metro]] in large-scale [[Cash and carry (sales)|Cash-and-Carry]] operations.\n\nWhile the growth in sales of processed foods in these countries has been much more rapid than the growth in fresh food sales, the imperative nature of supermarkets to achieve economies of scale in purchasing means that the expansion of supermarkets in these countries has important repercussions for small farmers, particularly those growing perishable crops. New supply chains have developed involving [[Business cluster|cluster]] formation; development of specialized wholesalers; leading farmers organizing supply, and farmer associations or cooperatives.<ref>Kevin Chen, Andrew W.

Packages are placed on shelves, arranged in aisles and sections according to type of item. Some items, such as fresh produce, are stored in bins. Those requiring an intact [[cold chain]] are in temperature-controlled display cases.\n\nWhile branding and store advertising will differ from company to company, the layout of a supermarket remains virtually unchanged. Although big companies spend time giving consumers a pleasant shopping experience, the design of a supermarket is directly connected to the in-store marketing that supermarkets must conduct in order to get shoppers to spend more money while there.\n\nEvery aspect of the store is mapped out and attention is paid to color, wording and even surface texture. The overall layout of a supermarket is a visual merchandising project that plays a major role. Stores can creatively use a layout to alter customers\u2019 perceptions of the atmosphere. Alternatively, they can enhance the store's atmospherics through visual communications (signs and graphics), lighting, colors, and even scents.<ref>Gajanayake, R., Gajanayake, S., Surangi, H 2011, \"The impact of selected visual merchandising techniques on patronage intentions in supermarkets\", International Conference on Business and Economic Research, p. 1130\u20131165</ref> For example, to give a sense of the supermarket being healthy, fresh produce is deliberately located at the front of the store. In terms of bakery items, supermarkets usually dedicate 30 to 40 feet of store space to the bread aisle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/MAGAZINE/PASTISSUES/2011/october2011/Pages/Feature13.aspx|title=NACS Magazine - Category Close Up: Take Bread to the Bank|website=nacsonline.com|access-date=6 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223032957/http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/MAGAZINE/PASTISSUES/2011/october2011/Pages/Feature13.aspx|archive-date=23 February 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSupermarkets are designed to \"give each product section a sense of individual difference and this is evident in the design of what is called the anchor departments; fresh produce, dairy, delicatessen, meat and the bakery\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Browne|first=Karen|title=Trolley Psychology: Choice unlocks the psychological secrets of the supermarket and shows you how to avoid spending more than you mean to|journal=Australian Consumer's Association Choice Magazine|date=April 2010|issue=4|page=60}}</ref> Each section has different floor coverings, style, lighting and sometimes even individual services counters to allow shoppers to feel as if there are a number of markets within this one supermarket.<ref>2 Browne, K 2010, \"Trolley Psychology: Choice unlocks the psychological secrets of the supermarket and shows you how to avoid spending more than you mean to\", Choice, Australasian Consumers' Association, Chippendale, NSW, Australia, no. 4, April, p60, retrieved 14 October, Expanded Academic Database</ref>\n\n[[File:Minatkulim.jpg|right|thumb|Exterior of a supermarket in [[Kulim]], [[Kedah]], [[Malaysia]]]]\nMarketers use well-researched techniques to try to control purchasing behavior.

High impulse and high margin products are placed in the most predominant areas to grab attention. Power products are placed on both sides of the aisle to create increased product awareness, and end caps are used to receive a high exposure of a certain product whether on special, promotion or in a campaign, or a new line.\n\nThe first principle of the layout is circulation. Circulation is created by arranging product so the supermarket can control the traffic flow of the consumer. Along with this path, there will be high-draw, high-impulse items that will influence the consumer to purchase which he or she did not intend. Service areas such as restrooms are placed in a location which draws the consumer past certain products to create extra buys. Necessity items such as bread and milk are found at the rear of the store to increase the start of circulation. Cashiers' desks are placed in a position to promote circulation. The entrance will be on the right-hand side because research has shown that consumers who travel in a counter-clockwise direction spend more.<ref>Browne, p.&nbsp;60.</ref>\n\nThe second principle of the layout is coordination. Coordination is the organized arrangement of product that promotes sales. Products such as fast-selling and slow-selling lines are placed in strategic positions in aid of the overall sales plan. Managers sometimes place different items in fast-selling places to increase turnover or to promote a new line.\n\nThe third principle is consumer convenience. The layout of a supermarket is designed to create a high degree of convenience to the consumer to make the shopping experience pleasant and increase customer spending.<ref name=\"Park\"/> This is done through the character of merchandising and product placement. There are many different ideas and theories in relation to layout and how product layout can influence the purchases made. One theory suggests that certain products are placed together or near one another that are of a similar or complementary nature to increase the average customer spend.<ref name=\"Balachander\">Bezawada, R Balachander, S Kannan, PK Venkatesh, S 2009, \"Cross-Category Effects of Aisle and Display Placements: A Spatial Modeling Approach and Insights\", ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 73, no. 3, pp. 99\u2013117, 3 May 2012, Business Source Complete.</ref> This strategy is used to create cross-category sales similarity. In other words, the toothpaste is next to or adjacent the toothbrushes and the tea and coffee are down the same aisle as the sweet biscuits. These products complement one another and placing them near is one-way marketers try to increase purchases.<ref name=\"Balachander\"/> \n\nFor vertical placement, cheap generic brands tend to be on the lowest shelves, products appealing to children are placed at the mid-thigh level, and the most profitable brands are placed at eye level.<ref name=\"Park\">{{cite news|last1=Park|first1=Michael Y.|title=How to Buy Food: The Psychology of the Supermarket|url=http://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/supermarket-psychology|accessdate=27 February 2017|work=Bon Appetit|date=30 October 2014|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth principle is the use of [[Color psychology#Store and display color|color psychology]], and the locations of the food,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/03/21/living/real-simple-color-shopping/index.html\n |title=How color affects your spending - CNN\n |last=Simple|first=By Yelena Moroz Alpert, Real|work=CNN\n |access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> similar to its use in [[fast food]] branding.\n\nConsumer psychologists suggest that most buyers tend to enter the store and shop to their right first.<ref name=Browne>Browne, K 2012, \"Trolley Psychology: Choice Unlocks the Psychological Secrets of the Supermarket and Shows You How to Avoid Spending More Than You Mean To\", ''Choice'', no. 4, p. 60, 3 May 2012, expanded academic database.</ref> Some supermarkets, therefore, choose to place the entrance to the left-hand side as the consumer will likely turn right upon entry, and this allows the consumer to do a full anticlockwise circle around the store before returning to the checkouts.  This suggests that supermarket marketers should use this theory to their advantage by placing their temporary displays of products on the right-hand side to entice you to make an unplanned purchase. Furthermore, aisle ends are extremely popular with product manufacturers, who pay top dollar to have their products located there.<ref>Browne, 2010</ref> These aisle ends are used to lure customers into making a snap purchase and to also entice them to shop down the aisle. The most obvious place supermarket layout influences consumers are at the checkout. Small displays of chocolates, magazines, and drinks are located at each checkout to tempt shoppers while they wait to be served.<ref name=Browne />\n[[File:Shelves in kaduna.jpg|thumb|Arrangement of products in a shelves in a supermarket in [[Kaduna]]]]\n\n==Types of supermarkets==\nSome supermarkets are focusing on selling more (or even exclusively) [[Organic certification|organically certified]] produce.<ref>[https://www.handelsblatt.com/today/companies/german-groceries-the-organic-retail-revolution/23565580.html The Organic Retail Revolution]</ref><ref>[https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/Organic-food-sector-booming-in-France Organic food sector booming in France]</ref> Others are trying to differentiate itself through selling less (or no) products containing [[palm oil]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/10/iceland-to-be-first-uk-supermarket-to-cut-palm-oil-from-own-brand-products Iceland to be first UK supermarket to cut palm oil from own-brand products]</ref> This as the demand of palm oil is a main driver for the destruction of rainforests.\nAs a response to the growing concern on the heavy use of petroleum-based plastics for [[food packaging]], so-called \"[[zero waste]]\" and \"plastic-free\" supermarkets and groceries are on the rise.<ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/04/plastic-free-supermarket-grocery-shopping/ Grocery stores are packed with plastic.

It is larger and has a wider selection than earlier [[grocery store]]s, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a [[hypermarket]] or [[Big-box store|big-box market]].\n\nThe supermarket typically has aisles for meat, fresh [[produce]], dairy, and baked goods. \nShelf space is also reserved for canned and packaged goods and for various non-food items such as kitchenware, household cleaners, pharmacy products and pet supplies.  Some supermarkets also sell other household products that are consumed regularly, such as alcohol (where permitted), medicine, and [[clothing|clothes]], and some sell a much wider range of non-food products: DVDs, sporting equipment, board games, and seasonal items (e.g., Christmas wrapping paper in December).\n\nA larger full-service supermarket combined with a [[department store]] is sometimes known as a [[hypermarket]]. Other services may include those of [[bank]]s, [[Coffeehouses|caf\u00e9s]], [[Day care|childcare centres/creches]], [[insurance]] (and other financial services), [[Mobile Phone]] services, [[Photographic processing|photo processing]], [[video rental]]s, [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] or [[petrol station]]s.  If the eatery in a supermarket is substantial enough, the facility may be called a \"grocerant\", a blend of \"grocery\" and \"restaurant\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/04/05/grocerants-take-bite-out-restaurants/99723098/\n |title=Why 'Grocerants' are the new trend, taking bite out of restaurants\n |last=Meyer|first=Zlati|date=5 April 2017|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=6 April 2017\n |quote=The phenomenon is growing fast enough both in prevalence and sophistication that the food industry has coined a name for these combination grocery stores and eateries &ndash; the 'grocerant.'}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional supermarket occupies a large amount of floor space, usually on a single level. It is usually situated near a residential area in order to be convenient to consumers. The basic appeal is the availability of a broad selection of goods under a single roof, at relatively low prices. Other advantages include ease of parking and frequently the convenience of shopping hours that extend into the evening or even 24 hours of the day. Supermarkets usually allocate large budgets to advertising, typically through newspapers.  They also present elaborate in-shop displays of products.\n\nSupermarkets typically are [[chain store]]s, supplied by the [[distribution center]]s of their [[parent company|parent companies]] thus increasing opportunities for [[economies of scale]].  Supermarkets usually offer products at relatively low prices by using their buying power to buy goods from manufacturers at lower prices than smaller stores can.  They also minimise financing costs by paying for goods at least 30 days after receipt and some extract credit terms of 90 days or more from vendors.  Certain products (typically [[staple foods]] such as [[bread]], [[milk]] and [[sugar]]) are very occasionally sold as [[loss leader]]s so as to attract shoppers to their store.  Supermarkets make up for their low margins by a high volume of sales, and with of higher-margin items bought by the attracted shoppers. [[Self-service]] with [[shopping cart]]s (trolleys) or baskets reduces [[Direct labor cost|labor cost]], and many supermarket chains are attempting further reduction by shifting to [[self-checkout|self-service check-out]].\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}\n[[File:Astor Market meat counter in Manhattan in 1915.jpg|thumb|Astor Market in New York, one predecessor of the modern super market operated in 1915\u20131917.]]\n[[File:SB-butik 1941.jpg|thumb|A supermarket in Sweden in 1941]]\n[[File:EmpressWalkLoblaws-Vivid.jpg|thumb|Consumers shopping for produce and fruit.]]\n\nIn the early days of retailing, products generally were fetched by an assistant from shelves behind the merchant's counter while customers waited in front of the counter and indicated the items they wanted.  Most foods and merchandise did not come in individually wrapped consumer-sized packages, so an assistant had to measure out and wrap the precise amount desired by the consumer.  This offered opportunities for social interaction: many regarded this style of shopping as \"a social occasion\" and would often \"pause for conversations with the staff or other customers\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Supermarket security system supplier|url=http://www.dragon-guard.com/|website=Dragon Guard Inc.|accessdate=10 January 2018}} {{Failed verification|date=January 2018}}</ref>  These practices were by nature slow and [[labor intensity|labor-intensive]] and therefore also quite expensive.  The number of customers who could be attended to at one time was limited by the number of staff employed in the store. Shopping for groceries also often involved trips to multiple specialty shops, such as a [[greengrocer]], butcher, bakery, fishmonger and [[dry goods]] store; in addition to a [[general store]]. Milk and other items of short [[shelf life]] were delivered by a [[milkman]]. \n\nThe concept of an inexpensive food market relying on large economies of scale was developed by [[Vincent Astor]].  He founded the Astor Market in 1915, investing $750,000 ($18 million in 2015 currency) of his fortune into a 165' by 125' (50x38 metre) corner of 95th and Broadway, [[Manhattan]], creating, in effect, an open-air mini-mall that sold meat, fruit, produce and flowers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Opening of the Astor market, New York City, 1915|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c06967/|website=[[Library of Congress]]|year=1915}}</ref>  The expectation was that customers would come from great distances (\"miles around\"), but in the end, even attracting people from ten blocks away was difficult, and the market folded in 1917.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Western Fruit Jobber|volume=IV|title=The Retailer|issue=3|date=July 1917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRMkAQAAIAAJ&dq=%22astor%20market%22&pg=RA2-PA52#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=The Astor Legacy in Brick and Stone|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=10 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=Streetscapes: Thalia Theater; a closed revival house that may itself be revived|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=5 July 1987|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/realestate/streetscapes-thalia-theater-a-closed-revival-house-that-may-itself-be-revived.html}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of a self-service grocery store was developed by [[entrepreneur]] [[Clarence Saunders (grocer)|Clarence Saunders]] and his [[Piggly Wiggly]] stores. His first store opened in 1916. Saunders was awarded a number of [[patent]]s for the ideas he incorporated into his stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1242872A/en|title=Self-serving store.|author=|date=|website=google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1407680A/en|title=Lighting system for self-serving stores|author=|date=|website=google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1704061A/en|title=Self-serving store|author=|date=|website=google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1647889A/en|title=Arrangement and construction of store fixtures|author=|date=|website=google.com}}</ref> The stores were a financial success and Saunders began to offer franchises. [[The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company]], which was established in 1859, was another successful early grocery store chain in [[Canada]] and the United States, and became common in North American cities in the 1920s. Early self-service grocery stores did not sell fresh meats or produce. Combination stores that sold perishable items were developed in the 1920s.<ref>Strasser, Susan ''Never Done: A History of American Housework'' Holt Paperbacks, 2000.\n\nThe general trend since then has been to stock shelves at night so that customers, the following day, can obtain their own goods and bring them to the front of the store to pay for them. Although there is a higher risk of [[shoplifting]], the costs of appropriate security measures ideally will be outweighed by reduced labor costs.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} </ref>\n\nHistorically, there has been debate about the origin of the supermarket, with [[King Kullen]] and [[Ralphs]] of [[California]] having strong claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.groceteria.com/store/regional-chains/p-t/ralphs/|title=Ralphs Grocery Company|author=|date=5 February 2009|website=groceteria.com}}</ref> Other contenders included [[Weingarten's|Weingarten's Big Food Markets]] and [[Henke & Pillot]].<ref>''Supermarket News'', 29 August 2005, p. 10</ref> To end the debate, the [[Food Marketing Institute]] in conjunction with the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and with funding from [[H.J. Heinz]], researched the issue.  They defined the attributes of a supermarket as \"self-service, separate product departments, discount pricing, marketing and volume selling\".{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThey determined that the first true supermarket in the United States was opened by a former [[Kroger]] employee, [[Michael J. Cullen]], on 4 August 1930, inside a {{convert|6000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} former garage in [[Jamaica, Queens]] in [[New York City]].<ref>Anonymous, \"The place where supermarketing was born,\" ''Mass Market Retailers'' 19, no. 9 (17 June 2002): 172.</ref>  The store, King Kullen, operated under the slogan \"Pile it high. Sell it low.\" At the time of Cullen's death in 1936, there were seventeen King Kullen stores in operation. Although Saunders had brought the world self-service, uniform stores, and nationwide marketing, Cullen built on this idea by adding separate food departments, selling large volumes of food at discount prices and adding a parking lot.\n\n[[File:Safeway50s.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] advertisement from the 1950s]]\nOther established American grocery chains in the 1930s, such as Kroger and [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] at first resisted Cullen's idea, but eventually were forced to build their own supermarkets as the economy sank into the [[Great Depression]], while consumers were becoming price-sensitive at a level never experienced before.<ref>Ryan Mathews, \"1926\u20131936: Entrepreneurs and Enterprise: A Look at Industry Pioneers like King Kullen and J.

The idea of \"monopsony\", proposed by Cambridge economist Joan Robinson in 1933, that a single buyer could out-power the market of multiple sellers, became a strong anti-chain rhetorical device. With public backlash came political pressure to even the playing field for smaller vendors without the luxuries of economies of scale. In 1936, the [[Robinson-Patman Act]] was implemented as a way of preventing such larger chains from using this buying power to reap advantages over smaller stores, although the act was not well enforced and did not have much impact on the prevention of larger chains overtaking power in the markets.<ref>Hamilton, Shane ''Supermarkets, Free markets, and the Problem of Buying Power in the Postwar United States,'' in What's Good For Business: Business and Politics Since World War II, ed.

Other chains caught on, and after Galvani lost out to Tesco's [[Jack Cohen (businessman)|Jack Cohen]] in 1960 to buy the 212 Irwin's chain, the sector underwent a large amount of consolidation, resulting in 'the big four' dominant UK of today: [[Tesco]], [[Asda]] (owned by [[Wal-Mart]]), [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Morrisons]].\n\nIn the 1950s, supermarkets frequently issued [[trading stamp]]s as incentives to customers.

This applies particularly to Latin America, South-East Asia, India, China and South Africa. However, growth is being witnessed in nearly all countries. With growth, has come considerable competition and some amount of consolidation.<ref>Thomas Reardon, Peter Timmer and Julio Berdegue, 2004.

''Journal of Agricultural and Development Economics'', Vol 1 No 2.</ref> The growth has been driven by increasing affluence and the rise of a middle class; the entry of women into the workforce; with a consequent incentive to seek out easy-to-prepare foods; the growth in the use of refrigerators, making it possible to shop weekly instead of daily; and the growth in car ownership, facilitating journeys to distant stores and purchases of large quantities of goods. The opportunities presented by this potential have encouraged several European companies to invest in these markets (mainly in Asia) and American companies to invest in Latin America and China. Local companies also entered the market.<ref>Reardon et al, op cit</ref> Initial development of supermarkets has now been followed by hypermarket growth. In addition there were investments by companies such as [[Makro]] and [[Metro Cash and Carry|Metro]] in large-scale [[Cash and carry (sales)|Cash-and-Carry]] operations.\n\nWhile the growth in sales of processed foods in these countries has been much more rapid than the growth in fresh food sales, the imperative nature of supermarkets to achieve economies of scale in purchasing means that the expansion of supermarkets in these countries has important repercussions for small farmers, particularly those growing perishable crops. New supply chains have developed involving [[Business cluster|cluster]] formation; development of specialized wholesalers; leading farmers organizing supply, and farmer associations or cooperatives.<ref>Kevin Chen, Andrew W.

Packages are placed on shelves, arranged in aisles and sections according to type of item. Some items, such as fresh produce, are stored in bins. Those requiring an intact [[cold chain]] are in temperature-controlled display cases.\n\nWhile branding and store advertising will differ from company to company, the layout of a supermarket remains virtually unchanged. Although big companies spend time giving consumers a pleasant shopping experience, the design of a supermarket is directly connected to the in-store marketing that supermarkets must conduct in order to get shoppers to spend more money while there.\n\nEvery aspect of the store is mapped out and attention is paid to color, wording and even surface texture. The overall layout of a supermarket is a visual merchandising project that plays a major role. Stores can creatively use a layout to alter customers\u2019 perceptions of the atmosphere. Alternatively, they can enhance the store's atmospherics through visual communications (signs and graphics), lighting, colors, and even scents.<ref>Gajanayake, R., Gajanayake, S., Surangi, H 2011, \"The impact of selected visual merchandising techniques on patronage intentions in supermarkets\", International Conference on Business and Economic Research, p. 1130\u20131165</ref> For example, to give a sense of the supermarket being healthy, fresh produce is deliberately located at the front of the store. In terms of bakery items, supermarkets usually dedicate 30 to 40 feet of store space to the bread aisle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/MAGAZINE/PASTISSUES/2011/october2011/Pages/Feature13.aspx|title=NACS Magazine - Category Close Up: Take Bread to the Bank|website=nacsonline.com|access-date=6 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223032957/http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/MAGAZINE/PASTISSUES/2011/october2011/Pages/Feature13.aspx|archive-date=23 February 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSupermarkets are designed to \"give each product section a sense of individual difference and this is evident in the design of what is called the anchor departments; fresh produce, dairy, delicatessen, meat and the bakery\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Browne|first=Karen|title=Trolley Psychology: Choice unlocks the psychological secrets of the supermarket and shows you how to avoid spending more than you mean to|journal=Australian Consumer's Association Choice Magazine|date=April 2010|issue=4|page=60}}</ref> Each section has different floor coverings, style, lighting and sometimes even individual services counters to allow shoppers to feel as if there are a number of markets within this one supermarket.<ref>2 Browne, K 2010, \"Trolley Psychology: Choice unlocks the psychological secrets of the supermarket and shows you how to avoid spending more than you mean to\", Choice, Australasian Consumers' Association, Chippendale, NSW, Australia, no. 4, April, p60, retrieved 14 October, Expanded Academic Database</ref>\n\n[[File:Minatkulim.jpg|right|thumb|Exterior of a supermarket in [[Kulim]], [[Kedah]], [[Malaysia]].]]\nMarketers use well-researched techniques to try to control purchasing behavior. The layout of a supermarket is considered by some to consist of a few rules of thumb and three layout principles.<ref name=Aghazadeh>\nAghazedah, S 2005, \"Layout strategies for some of the operations\", Management Research News, vol. 28, no. 10, pp. 31\u201346, retrieved 8 May 2012, Business Source Complete, EBSCO host.</ref> The high-draw products are placed in separate areas of the store to keep drawing the consumer through the store. High impulse and high margin products are placed in the most predominant areas to grab attention. Power products are placed on both sides of the aisle to create increased product awareness, and end caps are used to receive a high exposure of a certain product whether on special, promotion or in a campaign, or a new line.\n\nThe first principle of the layout is circulation. Circulation is created by arranging product so the supermarket can control the traffic flow of the consumer. Along with this path, there will be high-draw, high-impulse items that will influence the consumer to purchase which he or she did not intend. Service areas such as restrooms are placed in a location which draws the consumer past certain products to create extra buys. Necessity items such as bread and milk are found at the rear of the store to increase the start of circulation. Cashiers' desks are placed in a position to promote circulation. The entrance will be on the right-hand side because research has shown that consumers who travel in a counter-clockwise direction spend more.<ref>Browne, p.&nbsp;60.</ref>\n\nThe second principle of the layout is coordination. Coordination is the organized arrangement of product that promotes sales. Products such as fast-selling and slow-selling lines are placed in strategic positions in aid of the overall sales plan. Managers sometimes place different items in fast-selling places to increase turnover or to promote a new line.\n\nThe third principle is consumer convenience. The layout of a supermarket is designed to create a high degree of convenience to the consumer to make the shopping experience pleasant and increase customer spending.<ref name=\"Park\"/> This is done through the character of merchandising and product placement. There are many different ideas and theories in relation to layout and how product layout can influence the purchases made. One theory suggests that certain products are placed together or near one another that are of a similar or complementary nature to increase the average customer spend.<ref name=\"Balachander\">Bezawada, R Balachander, S Kannan, PK Venkatesh, S 2009, \"Cross-Category Effects of Aisle and Display Placements: A Spatial Modeling Approach and Insights\", ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 73, no. 3, pp. 99\u2013117, 3 May 2012, Business Source Complete.</ref> This strategy is used to create cross-category sales similarity. In other words, the toothpaste is next to or adjacent the toothbrushes and the tea and coffee are down the same aisle as the sweet biscuits. These products complement one another and placing them near is one-way marketers try to increase purchases.<ref name=\"Balachander\"/> \n\nFor vertical placement, cheap generic brands tend to be on the lowest shelves, products appealing to children are placed at the mid-thigh level, and the most profitable brands are placed at eye level.<ref name=\"Park\">{{cite news|last1=Park|first1=Michael Y.|title=How to Buy Food: The Psychology of the Supermarket|url=http://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/supermarket-psychology|accessdate=27 February 2017|work=Bon Appetit|date=30 October 2014|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth principle is the use of [[Color psychology#Store and display color|color psychology]], and the locations of the food,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/03/21/living/real-simple-color-shopping/index.html\n |title=How color affects your spending - CNN\n |last=Simple|first=By Yelena Moroz Alpert, Real|work=CNN\n |access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> similar to its use in [[fast food]] branding.\n\nConsumer psychologists suggest that most buyers tend to enter the store and shop to their right first.<ref name=Browne>Browne, K 2012, \"Trolley Psychology: Choice Unlocks the Psychological Secrets of the Supermarket and Shows You How to Avoid Spending More Than You Mean To\", ''Choice'', no. 4, p. 60, 3 May 2012, expanded academic database.</ref> Some supermarkets, therefore, choose to place the entrance to the left-hand side as the consumer will likely turn right upon entry, and this allows the consumer to do a full anticlockwise circle around the store before returning to the checkouts.  This suggests that supermarket marketers should use this theory to their advantage by placing their temporary displays of products on the right-hand side to entice you to make an unplanned purchase. Furthermore, aisle ends are extremely popular with product manufacturers, who pay top dollar to have their products located there.<ref>Browne, 2010</ref> These aisle ends are used to lure customers into making a snap purchase and to also entice them to shop down the aisle. The most obvious place supermarket layout influences consumers are at the checkout. Small displays of chocolates, magazines, and drinks are located at each checkout to tempt shoppers while they wait to be served.<ref name=Browne />\n[[File:Shelves in kaduna.jpg|thumb|Arrangement of products in a shelves in a supermarket in [[Kaduna]]]]\n\n==Types of supermarkets==\nSome supermarkets are focusing on selling more (or even exclusively) [[Organic certification|organically certified]] produce.<ref>[https://www.handelsblatt.com/today/companies/german-groceries-the-organic-retail-revolution/23565580.html The Organic Retail Revolution]</ref><ref>[https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/Organic-food-sector-booming-in-France Organic food sector booming in France]</ref> Others are trying to differentiate itself through selling less (or no) products containing [[palm oil]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/10/iceland-to-be-first-uk-supermarket-to-cut-palm-oil-from-own-brand-products Iceland to be first UK supermarket to cut palm oil from own-brand products]</ref> This as the demand of palm oil is a main driver for the destruction of rainforests.\nAs a response to the growing concern on the heavy use of petroleum-based plastics for [[food packaging]], so-called \"[[zero waste]]\" and \"plastic-free\" supermarkets and groceries are on the rise.<ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/04/plastic-free-supermarket-grocery-shopping/ Grocery stores are packed with plastic.
