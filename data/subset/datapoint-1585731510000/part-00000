As reported by ''The Times of Israel'':<blockquote>On April 22 [2012], the ''Guardian'' ran a page 27 correction apologizing for \"wrongly\" having called Jerusalem Israel's capital a few days earlier. The London-based paper then stated that according to its style guide, Tel Aviv is the country's capital. Indeed, the style guide at the time stated that designating Jerusalem as the capital is \"a mistake we have made more than once.\"\n\nAfter the Guardian's April correction\u2014published after the paper ran a caption on a photo showing passengers on a train observing a two-minute silence for Holocaust Remembrance Day\u2014Honest Reporting filed a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission.\n\nThe PCC, a non-governmental regulatory body which has the power to force publications to run corrections, initially defended the Guardian's position to call Tel Aviv Israel's capital, writing in its May ruling that \"many countries\" don't recognize Israel's classification of Jerusalem as its capital and that \"those nations enjoying diplomatic relations with Israel have their embassies in Tel Aviv.\" Therefore, the PCC wrote, the ''Guardian'' \"was entitled to refer to Tel Aviv as the capital of Israel. There was no breach of the code in this instance.\"\n\nAccording to Honest Reporting, whose stated mission is \"defending Israel from media bias,\" the London-based PCC ruling was flawed and had the \"potential to further delegitimize Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital, giving the British media a carte blanche to follow ''The Guardian''{{'}}s lead.\" Therefore, Honest Reporting initiated steps to file for a judicial review of the decision, leading the PCC in July to retract its original ruling and to ask the Guardian to defend their position\u2014which culminated in Wednesday's correction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/guardian-admits-we-were-wrong-in-calling-tel-aviv-israels-capital/|title=Guardian: We were wrong to call Tel Aviv Israel's capital |website=The Times of Israel|access-date=2016-05-24}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe PCC later overturned its original decision, concluding that \"the unequivocal statement that Tel Aviv is the capital of Israel had the potential to mislead readers and raised a breach of \u2026 the Editors' Code of Practice.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/uk-media-watchdog-rules-its-wrong-to-call-tel-aviv-israels-capital/|title=UK media watchdog rules: Tel Aviv is not the capital|website=The Times of Israel|access-date=2016-05-24}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThe [[American Journalism Review]] described the organisation as a \"pro-Israeli pressure group\".<ref name=\"Hons\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=3683 | title=Caught in the Crossfire | publisher=American Journalism Review | date=June\u2013July 2004 | accessdate=March 14, 2012 | author=Matusow, Barbara | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613032218/http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3683 | archive-date=June 13, 2010 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter being criticized by HonestReporting for articles published by ''[[The Independent]]'', author [[Robert Fisk]] wrote in the ''Independent'' that some of their readers sent him hate-mail.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Fisk\n | first = Robert\n | date = 28 May 2001\n | title = The internet threat to truly honest reporting\n | periodical = [[The Independent]]\n | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/robert--fisk-the-internet-threat-to-truly-honest-reporting-686255.html\n | accessdate = 2011-03-03\n}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a 2004 article published in the [[British Medical Journal]] which criticised Israel for a high level of Palestinian civilian casualties and claimed that the pattern of injuries suggested routine targeting of children in situations of minimal or no threat, the journal received over 500 responses to its website and nearly 1,000 sent directly to its editor. In an analysis of the responses published in the journal, [[Karl Sabbagh]] concluded that the correspondence was orchestrated by Honest Reporting and aimed at silencing legitimate criticism of Israel. In his analysis Sabbagh pointed to evidence that the correspondents had not read the article. Sabbagh also documented a significant proportion of offensive, abusive and racist insults among the correspondence.

The New York Times Media Decoder blog wrote:<blockquote>Some supporters of Israel seized on the Twitter posting almost immediately. A Web site called Honest Reporting that says it is \u201cdedicated to defending Israel against prejudice in the media\u201d asked, \u201cIs Nasr a Hezbollah sympathizer?

As reported by ''The Times of Israel'':<blockquote>On April 22 [2012], the ''Guardian'' ran a page 27 correction apologizing for \"wrongly\" having called Jerusalem Israel's capital a few days earlier. The London-based paper then stated that according to its style guide, Tel Aviv is the country's capital. Indeed, the style guide at the time stated that designating Jerusalem as the capital is \"a mistake we have made more than once.\"\n\nAfter the Guardian's April correction\u2014published after the paper ran a caption on a photo showing passengers on a train observing a two-minute silence for Holocaust Remembrance Day\u2014Honest Reporting filed a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission.\n\nThe PCC, a non-governmental regulatory body which has the power to force publications to run corrections, initially defended the Guardian's position to call Tel Aviv Israel's capital, writing in its May ruling that \"many countries\" don't recognize Israel's classification of Jerusalem as its capital and that \"those nations enjoying diplomatic relations with Israel have their embassies in Tel Aviv.\" Therefore, the PCC wrote, the ''Guardian'' \"was entitled to refer to Tel Aviv as the capital of Israel. There was no breach of the code in this instance.\"\n\nAccording to Honest Reporting, whose stated mission is \"defending Israel from media bias,\" the London-based PCC ruling was flawed and had the \"potential to further delegitimize Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital, giving the British media a carte blanche to follow ''The Guardian''{{'}}s lead.\" Therefore, Honest Reporting initiated steps to file for a judicial review of the decision, leading the PCC in July to retract its original ruling and to ask the Guardian to defend their position\u2014which culminated in Wednesday's correction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/guardian-admits-we-were-wrong-in-calling-tel-aviv-israels-capital/|title=Guardian: We were wrong to call Tel Aviv Israel's capital |website=The Times of Israel|access-date=2016-05-24}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe PCC later overturned its original decision, concluding that \"the unequivocal statement that Tel Aviv is the capital of Israel had the potential to mislead readers and raised a breach of \u2026 the Editors' Code of Practice.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/uk-media-watchdog-rules-its-wrong-to-call-tel-aviv-israels-capital/|title=UK media watchdog rules: Tel Aviv is not the capital|website=The Times of Israel|access-date=2016-05-24}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThe [[American Journalism Review]] described the organisation as a \"pro-Israeli pressure group\".<ref name=\"Hons\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=3683 | title=Caught in the Crossfire | publisher=American Journalism Review | date=June\u2013July 2004 | accessdate=March 14, 2012 | author=Matusow, Barbara | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613032218/http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3683 | archive-date=June 13, 2010 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter being criticized by HonestReporting for articles published by ''[[The Independent]]'', author [[Robert Fisk]] wrote in the ''Independent'' that some of their readers sent him hate-mail.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Fisk\n | first = Robert\n | date = 28 May 2001\n | title = The internet threat to truly honest reporting\n | periodical = [[The Independent]]\n | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/robert--fisk-the-internet-threat-to-truly-honest-reporting-686255.html\n | accessdate = 2011-03-03\n}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a 2004 article published in the [[British Medical Journal]] which criticised Israel for a high level of Palestinian civilian casualties and claimed that the pattern of injuries suggested routine targeting of children in situations of minimal or no threat, the journal received over 500 responses to its website and nearly 1,000 sent directly to its editor. In an analysis of the responses published in the journal, [[Karl Sabbagh]] concluded that the correspondence was orchestrated by Honest Reporting and aimed at silencing legitimate criticism of Israel. In his analysis Sabbagh pointed to evidence that the correspondents had not read the article. Sabbagh also documented a significant proportion of offensive, abusive and racist insults among the correspondence. An editorial by the BMJ referred to the campaign as bullying and said that the best way to counter such behaviour was to expose it to public scrutiny.<ref name=BMJEd>{{cite web|last=Fiona Godlee|first=Tony Delamothe|title=What to do about orchestrated email campaigns|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b500|work=British Medical Journal|publisher=www.bmj.com|accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=BMJKS>{{cite journal|last=Sabbagh|first=Karl|title=Perils of criticising Israel|journal=British Medical Journal|date=24 February 2009|volume=338|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.a2066|accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref> [[Daniel Finkelstein]], associate editor of ''[[The Times]]'', responded that Sabbagh's piece was \"anti-Israel propaganda\" that did not meet even \"basic academic standards\" of scientific analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/comment/columnists/medical-journal-made-me-ill|work=The Jewish Chronicle Online|accessdate=25 July 2012|last=Finkelstein|first=Daniel|title=Medical journal made me ill|date=5 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Honest Reporting Canada==\nHonestReporting Canada (HRC) is the Canadian branch of the organization.
