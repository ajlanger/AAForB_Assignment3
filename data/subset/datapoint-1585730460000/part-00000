Smith and Franks partnered again in 2009 for the sequel with even more celebrities joining in to raise more funds for the Catoosa County Learning Center.\n\nWith the 2007 release of ''Snake Oil, Superstars, and Me'', the autobiography of Ramblin' \"Doc\" Tommy Scott, Franks joined Scott and fellow co-author Shirley Noe Swiesz in completing the 700-page project highlighting Scott's 90 years on the stage, film, and television.<ref>Bluegrass Unlimited (USA)December 2008, by: WVS, \"Snake Oil, Superstars and Me: The Story of Ramblin' 'Doc' Tommy Scott\"</ref>\n\nAs of 2017, he is working on a book tentatively titled Frankly Speaking : Thoughts on This and That\n\n===Journalist===\n\nFranks began an interest in writing while still in high school. He began writing entertainment articles for various publications such as ''Bluegrass Unlimited'',<ref>Bluegrass Unlimited (USA)June 1988, pg. 66, by: Randy Franks, \"We're Having a Revival\"</ref> the ''SEBA Breakdown'',<ref>The SEBA Breakdown (USA)October 1984, Vol. 1, Iss. 1, pg. 5, by: Randy Franks, \"Diamond Lure (An Apple in the Bluegrass Eye)\"</ref> ''Precious Memories'' magazine, and others.\n\nHe focused on another career in mainstream journalism from 2001\u20132009 in association with News Publishing Co. He developed a syndicated slice of life and entertainment column called ''Southern Style'' which is used in  publications from North Carolina to Louisiana. Many readers equate his folksy style to that of the late columnist [[Lewis Grizzard]].<ref>The Nashville Musician (USA) January 2009, Vol. MMIX, Iss. 1, pg. 17, by: Walt Trott, \"Book cites country's homespun humor traditions\"</ref> He currently writes for various magazines.\n\nIn his first year of journalism, the Georgia Press Association awarded him a First Place Feature Photo award for a unique photo of the Bluegrass group The White Oak Mountain Boys. His writing has yielded 21 Georgia Press and one National Press Association awards; one among those is W. Trox Bankston Award. He has helped garner two W. G. Sutlive trophies for community service and assisted ''The Catoosa County News'' in achieving the General Excellence award in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and a National Press Association award for Local News coverage.<ref>The Catoosa County News (USA)2 July 2003, pg. 8A, by: Staff reports, \"Simply the best\" and annual award articles July 2002, 2004-2009</ref>\n\n===Screenwriting===\n\nHis love of writing blossomed into script writing under the tutorage of [[Carroll O'Connor]] during his time on ''In the Heat of the Night'', which yielded him the unique opportunity to co-write the screenplay for the No. 1 Country song \"Wolverton Mountain\" with [[Merle Kilgore]].<ref>IFCO Club House (USA)January 1998, pg. 23, by: Loudilla Johnson, \"Randall Franks and Merle Kilgore\"</ref>\n\n==Music Artist==\n\n===Early musical experiences===\n\nAs a child, Franks was exposed to the rich heritage of Georgia fiddlin' at family reunions. Franks' desire to learn was sparked at the age of eight when he heard the \"[[Orange Blossom Special (song)|Orange Blossom Special]]\" by Ervin Rouse. He was inspired to study both classically with Donald Grisier, Ph.D.<ref>http://www.sgmradio.com/2010/03/31/artist-feature-randall-franks/</ref> and at the feet of some of Georgia's fiddle legends such as the Skillet Licker Gordon Tanner, WSB Barndance host Cotton Carrier, Dallas Burrell, and Anita Sorrells Mathis.\n\nWhile still in school, Franks formed the children's bluegrass band The Peachtree Pickers. It was through this act that he gained attention from national acts and television becoming a regular on the ''Country Kids TV Series'' and appearing for the Grand Ole Opry. The group released five albums.<ref>Music City News (USA)December 1984, Vol. 23, Iss. 6, pg. 9, by: Lydia Dixon Harden, \"Alabama makes history at Eighteenth CMA Awards - The Peachtree Pickers entertain\"</ref>\n\nTo support the group's efforts Franks started a Randall \"Randy\" Franks Peachtree Picker Fan Club, coordinated by Pearl Bruce. The club grew to include around 8,000 fans by 1986 rivaling and exceeding those of top country stars of the period. Franks created ''The Pickin' Post'' newsletter to keep the large group of fans informed sharing info on his career as well as Southern bluegrass festivals and other groups. The club also launched ''The Singing Post'' for fans exclusively interested in gospel music. The club grew even more dramatically during Franks' success on television.\n\n===Fiddling===\n\nThe influence of the Georgia Fiddle Bands is apparent within Franks's style and recordings. He was exposed to the work of Fiddlin' John Carson, The Skillet Lickers and other Georgia fiddlers. He grew and gained skills by competing in Georgia fiddle contests, many fostered by World Record Mandolinist Bill Lowery as well as the Grand Ole Opry's Grand Master Fiddler Championship. Franks became a regular performer at the Grand Master Championship for the Opry. His bluegrass recording ''Tunes and Tales from Tunnel Hill'' includes a fact-based comedy recording entitled \"Big Tige, Mr. Roy and Me,\" describing a teenage adventure with Opry fiddling stars [[Benny Martin]] and [[Roy Acuff]] following a Grand Masters Championship. In the 1990s Georgia honored Franks for his work to preserve the heritage of Georgia's fiddling by naming a state-sponsored fiddle contest in his honor hosted then at Lake Lanier Islands.<ref>The Times (USA)22 April 1994, pg. 3D, by: Sandra Stringer, \"Festival features fiddling, food, crafts\"</ref>  The Randall Franks Trophy is presented to the winner each year at the 1890s Day Jamboree Old Time Fiddler's Convention in [[Ringgold, Georgia]].<ref>The Catoosa County News (USA)\t14 October 2009, by: None listed, \"Randall Franks Trophy winner places at Grand Master Fiddler Championship\"</ref> \nRandall Franks Trophy winners 1994-2018 are Jack Weeks, Roy Crawford, Johnny Ray Watts (Three-Times), Aerin DeJarnette, Mark Ralph, Doug Fleener, Megan Lynch, Maddie Denton (Five-Times), and Tyler Andal.<ref>\"Encouragers II: Walking with the Masters\" Peach Picked Publishing by: Randall Franks</ref> Randall Franks Trophy winner places at Grand Master Fiddler Championship\"</ref>   Franks also co-hosts America's Grand Master Fiddler Championship annually in Nashville at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. Franks recorded four fiddle recordings including ''Peach Picked Fiddle Favorites, Pick of the Peaches Fiddlin', Golden River Fiddlin', ''and'' Sacred Sounds of Appalachia.''\n\n===Bill Monroe===\n\nIn the 1980s, the Father of Bluegrass, [[Bill Monroe]] took a special interest in the young band and especially the young fiddler. Monroe spent hours teaching and sharing with Franks much like Monroe's Uncle Pen had done for him. With the departure of Kenny Baker, Franks was asked to join the Blue Grass Boys. Still in school, he took off to tour from coast to coast. Though school beckoned him back, Franks continued to make appearances with Monroe up until he stopped touring. For his contributions to the work of Bill Monroe, Franks was honored by the state of Kentucky.<ref>BMP - Bluegrass Music Profiles (USA)August 2008, pg. 40, by: None listed, \"Blue Grass Boys Memories with Randall Franks\"</ref> Randall has joined other members of the Blue Grass Boys in special performances beginning in 2007.\n\n===SEBA and fostering bluegrass===\n\nFranks founded the SouthEastern Bluegrass Association (SEBA) in 1984 to preserve, promote and publicize Bluegrass Music. Through the organization which has grown to one of the country's largest he supported the creation of the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] (IBMA).<ref>http://m.chronicle.augusta.com/things-do/applause/2011-01-12/georgia-bluegrass-performer-honored-founders-award</ref>\n\nFranks saw a bluegrass void in some areas in his home state of Georgia so in the mid-1980s he began promoting bluegrass concerts using regional talent in communities that did not have bluegrass events nearby to increase the visibility of the field outside bluegrass festivals. He carried this endeavor one step farther during his off time from ''In the Heat of the Night'' when he began the ''Share with D.A.R.E.'' (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) concert series held in communities in several states featuring acts including Jim and Jesse, The Lewis Family, [[the Osborne Brothers]], himself and others. The shows showcased bluegrass stars while raising awareness and funds for a program to help keep children off drugs.<ref>Cordele Dispatch (USA)23 February 1993, Vol. 76, Iss. 37, by: None listed, \"Stars to Share with DARE\"</ref>\n\n===Doodle and the Golden River Grass===\n\nFranks was also tapped by Folk Music's Doodle and the Golden River Grass to fill the fiddle role in the internationally recognized Appalachian performing group. He joined the group featuring John \"Doodle\" Thrower, James Watson, Gene Daniell, Wesley Clackum, and C.J. Clackum beginning in 1985 carrying on the Georgia Fiddle Band tradition. The group appeared repeatedly on PBS, America's National Folk Festival, World's Fair, Olympics, festivals and concerts. The band recorded on 17 albums highlighting their music including the Grammy winning \"Art of Field Recording Vol. 1\" .<ref>Pickens County Progress (USA)1 October 1987, \"Georgia Marble Festival\"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=|last=|first=|date=|url=http://www.cybergrass.com/node/5779#sthash.kAOrfRRy.dpbs|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===The Marksmen Quartet===\n\nMulti-award-winning gospel quartet, [[the Marksmen Quartet]] of Murrayville, Ga, also added Franks to its musical ensemble in 1984. Franks admired the group for their vocal artistry and performed intermittently with the group into the early 1990s. He recorded several albums with the quartet.<ref>Bluegrass Unlimited (USA)February 1988, Vol. 22, Iss. no. 8, pg. 36-38, by: Wayne W. Daniel, \"The Marksmen, Bluegrass Gospel, Straight and to the Point\"</ref>\n\n===Jeff & Sheri Easter===\n\nFranks became the first fiddler for the Grammy nominated duo [[Jeff & Sheri Easter]] when they began their career touring to promote their debut album - New Tradition. Franks appeared live and on television with the group which went on to become an integral part of [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)]]'s  Homecoming Friends.\n\n===Randall's Solo Career===\n\nAfter the members of the Peachtree Pickers embarked on different journeys in college, Franks decided to focus on creating music as a solo artist and studying acting. He juggled his own performances between guest appearances with various acts and acting opportunities. Making his first guest star appearance for the Grand Ole Opry in 1983, he continued appearing for the mother church of country music through the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1989, Franks released ''Golden River Fiddlin{{'}}'' to the Folk and Bluegrass markets. SPBGMA, the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music in America, said Franks had a \"special touch on the fiddle\" while ''Bluegrass Unlimited'' called him \"hard driving\u2026straightahead\u2026solid\u2026sure\u201d like [[Tommy Jackson (musician)|Tommy Jackson]] and Paul Warren.\n\nFranks began the 1990s as he crossed over to the Southern Gospel market being the first bluegrass performer to take his solo music project ''Handshakes and Smiles'' to the Top 20 Sales Charts.<ref>Music City News (USA)June 1990, Vol. 27, Iss. 12, pg. 91, \"Top LPs with Hot Tracks\"</ref> ''Singing News'' gave it Four Stars.<ref>The Singing News (USA)March 1990, Vol. 20, Iss. 11, pg. 73, by: Jerry Kirksey, \"Handshakes and Smiles\"</ref> He directed a music video of \"Handshakes and Smiles\" for the project which was nominated for a Telly Award and ran on country and gospel cable channels as well as NBC and CBS stations. Alan Autry, David Hart, Pop Lewis, Jesse McReynolds, Travis Lewis, Mark Wheeler and Lewis Phillips were among those making a special appearance.\n\nFranks formed his Hollywood Hillbilly Jamboree in the early 1990s, continuing a musical legacy begun by Ramblin' \"Doc\" Tommy Scott in 1945, bringing his unique style of bluegrass into fairs, festivals and communities not normally including bluegrass in their annual celebrations. His country variety show included a variety of stars, one of those casts were [[Donna Douglas]] (Elly Mae Clampett of ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''), [[Sonny Shroyer]] (Enos from ''The Dukes of Hazzard''), and himself. Another television commercials package featured [[Dan Biggers]] (Doc Robb from ''In the Heat of the Night'').

His \"Let's Live Everyday Like It Was Christmas\" single with Grand Ole Opry stars The Whites was given a nod as one of the top Country Vocal Collaborations.\n\nHe presented [[Del McCoury]] his Male Vocalist of the Year Award at the IBMA Awards in Owensboro, Kentucky in 1992. Franks was tapped to host the SPBGMA Bluegrass Music Awards in Nashville, Tennessee at the Roy Acuff Theater in 1995.\n\nHis 2000 Crimson CD ''God's Children'' pays homage to the brother duets of the 1930s. The project includes appearances by David Davis, [[Sonny Shroyer]], Enos from ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', the late Cotton and Jane Carrier and Marty Hays. The single \"Children In Need\", co-written by Franks and Tommy Scott, featured a performance with Sonny Shroyer reminding listeners of the importance of helping the children in one's community through a whimsical tale told by Ollie the Old Church Owl portrayed by Shroyer.<ref>ACM Country Music News (USA) January 2001, pg. 9, by: None listed, \"Children in Need - Randall Franks and Sonny Shroyer join forces\"</ref>\n\nHe led a cast of Appalachian artists to create the Share America/Crimson CD \u201dAn Appalachian Musical Revival: Live at the Ringgold Depot\u201d in 2008.

Upon graduation, he entered a position as sales and promotions manager for Atlanta-based MBM Records. He also served as director for A & R for its family of labels including Encore and ASL and coordinated its publishing company.<ref>Marietta Daily Journal (USA)10 December 1987, by: Donna Harris, \"Smyrna studio seeking that perfect sound\"</ref> He quickly discovered that independent bluegrass and gospel music recordings were difficult to market amongst mainstream retailers, but he set out to make the music he loved available in as many outlets as he could.\n\nBluegrass label Atteiram Records also called upon Franks as a graphic artist and liner note writer using him to design album covers or cassette inserts for many of its artists. Some among those were The Crain Brothers, Appalachian Express, James Monroe, Jim Southern and Southern Sounds, Joe Stuart and Carl Sauceman, Brother Birch Monroe, Frank Buchanan, Carl Story and the Rambling Mountaineers, Vic Jordan, The Ridgerunners, The Boyd Brothers, Hubert Cox and the Southern Grass, The Blue Ridge Gentlemen, The Pinnacle Boys, and Southwind.\n\nAs he rose in popularity on television, he used his celebrity status to break down the barriers that he previously faced as a record executive and many other bluegrass and gospel artists encountered by calling mainstream and Christian retail buyers and store managers directly using his podium from NBC and CBS to assist record companies and distributors in marketing his and other bluegrass and gospel product.\n\nThrough the effort his products and many other artists sold by the companies he worked with became available in record chains throughout the country. He produced his own recordings and also shared his studio expertise with other artists.\n\nAt a time when the industry was made of largely of established stars rather than rising new performers, Franks joined fellow rising star [[Alison Krauss]] as the most visible fiddlers and personalities of the industry in the late eighties and early nineties.\n\nWith Franks' widespread notoriety he gained by weekly network exposure, he worked to expose bluegrass and Southern Gospel to this new audience appearing on radio and television talk, news and entertainment shows. Franks continues to appear on radio stations in all formats, television stations throughout the country, and gives print interviews talking about and sharing the music he loves.<ref>Bluegrass by the Bay (USA)\tOctober 1992, Vol. 10, Iss. 10, pg. 7,12,19, by: Nick Nichols, \"TV Actor Randall Franks seeks to expose wider audience to bluegrass and country music\"</ref>\n\n===In the Heat of the Night Christmas===\n\nServing both as an artist and producer, Randall Franks and his ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' co-star [[Alan Autry]] joined forces under the banner of Autry-Franks Productions to produce the charity ''In the Heat of the Night'' CD ''Christmas Time's A Comin{{'}}'' featuring the cast of the show. The project raised funds for drug abuse prevention charities.\n\nWith Franks producing, Autry performed his rendition of \"[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]\" in homage to [[Gene Autry]]. Franks performed an original song with [[Grand Ole Opry]] stars The Whites entitled \"Let's Live Everyday Like It was Christmas\". The duo both performed on \"Jingle Bells\" and \"Christmas Time's A Comin{{'}}\". Franks and Autry were able to include many music legends, some among them, Country Music Hall of Famers [[Kitty Wells]], [[Jimmy Dickens]], and [[Pee Wee King]] as well as many top legends from the Bluegrass genre, from [[Jim and Jesse]] to [[the Lewis Family]]. The ''Christmas Time's A Comin{{'}}'' CD released on Sonlite and MGM/UA was one of the most popular Christmas releases of 1991 and 1992 with Southern retailers.<ref>Gospel Voice (USA)December 1991, pg. 6, by: Edith Kynard, \"From TV to Country to bluegrass, stars join together for drug prevention project\"</ref>\n\nAutry and Franks marked the 20th Anniversary in 2012 with a charity re-release available from the Share America Foundation, Inc.<ref>http://www.chattanoogan.com/2012/11/16/238773/Christmas-CD-Locally-Benefits-North.aspx</ref>\n\n==Music publishing==\n\nFranks opened Peach Picked Publishing associated with Broadcast Music Inc. in the early 1980s focusing initially on the music created by him and his bandmates. While he has written songs for large publishing companies including Lowery Music Group, Chris White Music, and Chestnut Mound Publishing, he continues writing for Peach Picked including his hit bluegrass recording \"Filling the River with Tears\", popularized by David Davis and the Warrior River Boys. Eventually, Peach Picked expanded to include work from bluegrass hall of fame members including Chubby Wise and Curly Seckler, Georgia Music Hall of Fame member Cotton Carrier, and recordings by acts including [[Marty Stuart]], [[Ralph Stanley]], [[The Grateful Dead]], and David Davis and the Warrior River Boys. Franks also formed Randall Franks Music to manage the publishing and music catalogs of other artists. In this effort, he has assisted artists in negotiating monies from film, television, and sources around the world, including artists Ramblin' \"Doc\" Tommy Scott, Bill Monroe, Jim and Jesse, Flatt & Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys, and Curly Seckler.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.randallfranks.org/Music_Publishing.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613232628/http://randallfranks.org/Music_Publishing.html |archivedate=2012-06-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Disc jockey==\n\nWhile in college, Franks became part of the cast of the [[WRFG]] radio show ''The Bluegrass Festival'', hosted by T.P. and Sandra Hollomon.

Smith and Franks partnered again in 2009 for the sequel with even more celebrities joining in to raise more funds for the Catoosa County Learning Center.\n\nWith the 2007 release of ''Snake Oil, Superstars, and Me'', the autobiography of Ramblin' \"Doc\" Tommy Scott, Franks joined Scott and fellow co-author Shirley Noe Swiesz in completing the 700-page project highlighting Scott's 90 years on the stage, film, and television.<ref>Bluegrass Unlimited (USA)December 2008, by: WVS, \"Snake Oil, Superstars and Me: The Story of Ramblin' 'Doc' Tommy Scott\"</ref>\n\nAs of 2017, he is working on a book tentatively titled Frankly Speaking : Thoughts on This and That\n\n===Journalist===\n\nFranks began an interest in writing while still in high school. He began writing entertainment articles for various publications such as ''Bluegrass Unlimited'',<ref>Bluegrass Unlimited (USA)June 1988, pg. 66, by: Randy Franks, \"We're Having a Revival\"</ref> the ''SEBA Breakdown'',<ref>The SEBA Breakdown (USA)October 1984, Vol. 1, Iss. 1, pg. 5, by: Randy Franks, \"Diamond Lure (An Apple in the Bluegrass Eye)\"</ref> ''Precious Memories'' magazine, and others.\n\nHe focused on another career in mainstream journalism from 2001-2009 in association with News Publishing Co. He developed a syndicated slice of life and entertainment column called ''Southern Style'' which is used in  publications from North Carolina to Louisiana. Many readers equate his folksy style to that of the late columnist [[Lewis Grizzard]].<ref>The Nashville Musician (USA) January 2009, Vol. MMIX, Iss. 1, pg. 17, by: Walt Trott, \"Book cites country's homespun humor traditions\"</ref> He currently writes for various magazines.\n\nIn his first year of journalism, the Georgia Press Association awarded him a First Place Feature Photo award for a unique photo of the Bluegrass group The White Oak Mountain Boys. His writing has yielded 21 Georgia Press and one National Press Association awards; one among those is W. Trox Bankston Award. He has helped garner two W. G. Sutlive trophies for community service and assisted ''The Catoosa County News'' in achieving the General Excellence award in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and a National Press Association award for Local News coverage.<ref>The Catoosa County News (USA)2 July 2003, pg. 8A, by: Staff reports, \"Simply the best\" and annual award articles July 2002, 2004-2009</ref>\n\n===Screenwriting===\n\nHis love of writing blossomed into script writing under the tutorage of [[Carroll O'Connor]] during his time on ''In the Heat of the Night'', which yielded him the unique opportunity to co-write the screenplay for the No. 1 Country song \"Wolverton Mountain\" with [[Merle Kilgore]].<ref>IFCO Club House (USA)January 1998, pg. 23, by: Loudilla Johnson, \"Randall Franks and Merle Kilgore\"</ref>\n\n==Music Artist==\n\n===Early musical experiences===\n\nAs a child, Franks was exposed to the rich heritage of Georgia fiddlin' at family reunions. Franks' desire to learn was sparked at the age of eight when he heard the \"[[Orange Blossom Special (song)|Orange Blossom Special]]\" by Ervin Rouse. He was inspired to study both classically with Donald Grisier, Ph.D.<ref>http://www.sgmradio.com/2010/03/31/artist-feature-randall-franks/</ref> and at the feet of some of Georgia's fiddle legends such as the Skillet Licker Gordon Tanner, WSB Barndance host Cotton Carrier, Dallas Burrell, and Anita Sorrells Mathis.\n\nWhile still in school, Franks formed the children's bluegrass band The Peachtree Pickers. It was through this act that he gained attention from national acts and television becoming a regular on the ''Country Kids TV Series'' and appearing for the Grand Ole Opry. The group released five albums.<ref>Music City News (USA)December 1984, Vol. 23, Iss. 6, pg. 9, by: Lydia Dixon Harden, \"Alabama makes history at Eighteenth CMA Awards - The Peachtree Pickers entertain\"</ref>\n\nTo support the group's efforts Franks started a Randall \"Randy\" Franks Peachtree Picker Fan Club, coordinated by Pearl Bruce. The club grew to include around 8,000 fans by 1986 rivaling and exceeding those of top country stars of the period. Franks created ''The Pickin' Post'' newsletter to keep the large group of fans informed sharing info on his career as well as Southern bluegrass festivals and other groups. The club also launched ''The Singing Post'' for fans exclusively interested in gospel music. The club grew even more dramatically during Franks' success on television.\n\n===Fiddling===\n\nThe influence of the Georgia Fiddle Bands is apparent within Franks's style and recordings. He was exposed to the work of Fiddlin' John Carson, The Skillet Lickers and other Georgia fiddlers. He grew and gained skills by competing in Georgia fiddle contests, many fostered by World Record Mandolinist Bill Lowery as well as the Grand Ole Opry's Grand Master Fiddler Championship. Franks became a regular performer at the Grand Master Championship for the Opry. His bluegrass recording ''Tunes and Tales from Tunnel Hill'' includes a fact-based comedy recording entitled \"Big Tige, Mr. Roy and Me,\" describing a teenage adventure with Opry fiddling stars [[Benny Martin]] and [[Roy Acuff]] following a Grand Masters Championship. In the 1990s Georgia honored Franks for his work to preserve the heritage of Georgia's fiddling by naming a state-sponsored fiddle contest in his honor hosted then at Lake Lanier Islands.<ref>The Times (USA)22 April 1994, pg. 3D, by: Sandra Stringer, \"Festival features fiddling, food, crafts\"</ref>  The Randall Franks Trophy is presented to the winner each year at the 1890s Day Jamboree Old Time Fiddler's Convention in [[Ringgold, Georgia]].<ref>The Catoosa County News (USA)\t14 October 2009, by: None listed, \"Randall Franks Trophy winner places at Grand Master Fiddler Championship\"</ref> \nRandall Franks Trophy winners 1994-2018 are Jack Weeks, Roy Crawford, Johnny Ray Watts (Three-Times), Aerin DeJarnette, Mark Ralph, Doug Fleener, Megan Lynch, Maddie Denton (Five-Times), and Tyler Andal.<ref>\"Encouragers II: Walking with the Masters\" Peach Picked Publishing by: Randall Franks</ref> Randall Franks Trophy winner places at Grand Master Fiddler Championship\"</ref>   Franks also co-hosts America's Grand Master Fiddler Championship annually in Nashville at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. Franks recorded four fiddle recordings including ''Peach Picked Fiddle Favorites, Pick of the Peaches Fiddlin', Golden River Fiddlin', ''and'' Sacred Sounds of Appalachia.''\n\n===Bill Monroe===\n\nIn the 1980s, the Father of Bluegrass, [[Bill Monroe]] took a special interest in the young band and especially the young fiddler. Monroe spent hours teaching and sharing with Franks much like Monroe's Uncle Pen had done for him. With the departure of Kenny Baker, Franks was asked to join the Blue Grass Boys. Still in school, he took off to tour from coast to coast. Though school beckoned him back, Franks continued to make appearances with Monroe up until he stopped touring. For his contributions to the work of Bill Monroe, Franks was honored by the state of Kentucky.<ref>BMP - Bluegrass Music Profiles (USA)August 2008, pg. 40, by: None listed, \"Blue Grass Boys Memories with Randall Franks\"</ref> Randall has joined other members of the Blue Grass Boys in special performances beginning in 2007.\n\n===SEBA and fostering bluegrass===\n\nFranks founded the SouthEastern Bluegrass Association (SEBA) in 1984 to preserve, promote and publicize Bluegrass Music. Through the organization which has grown to one of the country's largest he supported the creation of the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] (IBMA).<ref>http://m.chronicle.augusta.com/things-do/applause/2011-01-12/georgia-bluegrass-performer-honored-founders-award</ref>\n\nFranks saw a bluegrass void in some areas in his home state of Georgia so in the mid-1980s he began promoting bluegrass concerts using regional talent in communities that did not have bluegrass events nearby to increase the visibility of the field outside bluegrass festivals. He carried this endeavor one step farther during his off time from ''In the Heat of the Night'' when he began the ''Share with D.A.R.E.'' (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) concert series held in communities in several states featuring acts including Jim and Jesse, The Lewis Family, [[the Osborne Brothers]], himself and others. The shows showcased bluegrass stars while raising awareness and funds for a program to help keep children off drugs.<ref>Cordele Dispatch (USA)23 February 1993, Vol. 76, Iss. 37, by: None listed, \"Stars to Share with DARE\"</ref>\n\n===Doodle and the Golden River Grass===\n\nFranks was also tapped by Folk Music's Doodle and the Golden River Grass to fill the fiddle role in the internationally recognized Appalachian performing group. He joined the group featuring John \"Doodle\" Thrower, James Watson, Gene Daniell, Wesley Clackum, and C.J. Clackum beginning in 1985 carrying on the Georgia Fiddle Band tradition. The group appeared repeatedly on PBS, America's National Folk Festival, World's Fair, Olympics, festivals and concerts. The band recorded on 17 albums highlighting their music including the Grammy winning \"Art of Field Recording Vol. 1\" .<ref>Pickens County Progress (USA)1 October 1987, \"Georgia Marble Festival\"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=|last=|first=|date=|url=http://www.cybergrass.com/node/5779#sthash.kAOrfRRy.dpbs|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===The Marksmen Quartet===\n\nMulti-award\u2013winning gospel quartet, [[the Marksmen Quartet]] of Murrayville, Ga, also added Franks to its musical ensemble in 1984. Franks admired the group for their vocal artistry and performed intermittently with the group into the early 1990s. He recorded several albums with the quartet.<ref>Bluegrass Unlimited (USA)February 1988, Vol. 22, Iss. no. 8, pg. 36-38, by: Wayne W. Daniel, \"The Marksmen, Bluegrass Gospel, Straight and to the Point\"</ref>\n\n===Jeff & Sheri Easter===\n\nFranks became the first fiddler for the Grammy nominated duo [[Jeff & Sheri Easter]] when they began their career touring to promote their debut album - New Tradition. Franks appeared live and on television with the group which went on to become an integral part of [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)]]'s  Homecoming Friends.\n\n===Randall's Solo Career===\n\nAfter the members of the Peachtree Pickers embarked on different journeys in college, Franks decided to focus on creating music as a solo artist and studying acting. He juggled his own performances between guest appearances with various acts and acting opportunities. Making his first guest star appearance for the Grand Ole Opry in 1983, he continued appearing for the mother church of country music through the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1989, Franks released ''Golden River Fiddlin{{'}}'' to the Folk and Bluegrass markets. SPBGMA, the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music in America, said Franks had a \"special touch on the fiddle\" while ''Bluegrass Unlimited'' called him \"hard driving\u2026straightahead\u2026solid\u2026sure\u201d like [[Tommy Jackson (musician)|Tommy Jackson]] and Paul Warren.\n\nFranks began the 1990s as he crossed over to the Southern Gospel market being the first bluegrass performer to take his solo music project ''Handshakes and Smiles'' to the Top 20 Sales Charts.<ref>Music City News (USA)June 1990, Vol. 27, Iss. 12, pg. 91, \"Top LPs with Hot Tracks\"</ref> ''Singing News'' gave it Four Stars.<ref>The Singing News (USA)March 1990, Vol. 20, Iss. 11, pg. 73, by: Jerry Kirksey, \"Handshakes and Smiles\"</ref> He directed a music video of \"Handshakes and Smiles\" for the project which was nominated for a Telly Award and ran on country and gospel cable channels as well as NBC and CBS stations. Alan Autry, David Hart, Pop Lewis, Jesse McReynolds, Travis Lewis, Mark Wheeler and Lewis Phillips were among those making a special appearance.\n\nFranks formed his Hollywood Hillbilly Jamboree in the early 1990s, continuing a musical legacy begun by Ramblin' \"Doc\" Tommy Scott in 1945, bringing his unique style of bluegrass into fairs, festivals and communities not normally including bluegrass in their annual celebrations. His country variety show included a variety of stars, one of those casts were [[Donna Douglas]] (Elly Mae Clampett of ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''), [[Sonny Shroyer]] (Enos from ''The Dukes of Hazzard''), and himself. Another television commercials package featured [[Dan Biggers]] (Doc Robb from ''In the Heat of the Night'').

Franks was tapped to host the SPBGMA Bluegrass Music Awards in Nashville, Tennessee at the Roy Acuff Theater in 1995.\n\nHis 2000 Crimson CD ''God's Children'' pays homage to the brother duets of the 1930s. The project includes appearances by David Davis, [[Sonny Shroyer]], Enos from ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', the late Cotton and Jane Carrier and Marty Hays. The single \"Children In Need\", co-written by Franks and Tommy Scott, featured a performance with Sonny Shroyer reminding listeners of the importance of helping the children in one's community through a whimsical tale told by Ollie the Old Church Owl portrayed by Shroyer.<ref>ACM Country Music News (USA) January 2001, pg. 9, by: None listed, \"Children in Need - Randall Franks and Sonny Shroyer join forces\"</ref>\n\nHe led a cast of Appalachian artists to create the Share America/Crimson CD \u201dAn Appalachian Musical Revival: Live at the Ringgold Depot\u201d in 2008.

Upon graduation, he entered a position as sales and promotions manager for Atlanta-based MBM Records. He also served as director for A & R for its family of labels including Encore and ASL and coordinated its publishing company.<ref>Marietta Daily Journal (USA)10 December 1987, by: Donna Harris, \"Smyrna studio seeking that perfect sound\"</ref> He quickly discovered that independent bluegrass and gospel music recordings were difficult to market amongst mainstream retailers, but he set out to make the music he loved available in as many outlets as he could.\n\nBluegrass label Atteiram Records also called upon Franks as a graphic artist and liner note writer using him to design album covers or cassette inserts for many of its artists. Some among those were The Crain Brothers, Appalachian Express, James Monroe, Jim Southern and Southern Sounds, Joe Stuart and Carl Sauceman, Brother Birch Monroe, Frank Buchanan, Carl Story and the Rambling Mountaineers, Vic Jordan, The Ridgerunners, The Boyd Brothers, Hubert Cox and the Southern Grass, The Blue Ridge Gentlemen, The Pinnacle Boys, and Southwind.\n\nAs he rose in popularity on television, he used his celebrity status to break down the barriers that he previously faced as a record executive and many other bluegrass and gospel artists encountered by calling mainstream and Christian retail buyers and store managers directly using his podium from NBC and CBS to assist record companies and distributors in marketing his and other bluegrass and gospel product.\n\nThrough the effort his products and many other artists sold by the companies he worked with became available in record chains throughout the country. He produced his own recordings and also shared his studio expertise with other artists.\n\nAt a time when the industry was made of largely of established stars rather than rising new performers, Franks joined fellow rising star [[Alison Krauss]] as the most visible fiddlers and personalities of the industry in the late eighties and early nineties.\n\nWith Franks' widespread notoriety he gained by weekly network exposure, he worked to expose bluegrass and Southern Gospel to this new audience appearing on radio and television talk, news and entertainment shows. Franks continues to appear on radio stations in all formats, television stations throughout the country, and gives print interviews talking about and sharing the music he loves.<ref>Bluegrass by the Bay (USA)\tOctober 1992, Vol. 10, Iss. 10, pg. 7,12,19, by: Nick Nichols, \"TV Actor Randall Franks seeks to expose wider audience to bluegrass and country music\"</ref>\n\n===In the Heat of the Night Christmas===\n\nServing both as an artist and producer, Randall Franks and his ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' co-star [[Alan Autry]] joined forces under the banner of Autry-Franks Productions to produce the charity ''In the Heat of the Night'' CD ''Christmas Time's A Comin{{'}}'' featuring the cast of the show. The project raised funds for drug abuse prevention charities.\n\nWith Franks producing, Autry performed his rendition of \"[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]\" in homage to [[Gene Autry]]. Franks performed an original song with [[Grand Ole Opry]] stars The Whites entitled \"Let's Live Everyday Like It was Christmas\". The duo both performed on \"Jingle Bells\" and \"Christmas Time's A Comin{{'}}\". Franks and Autry were able to include many music legends, some among them, Country Music Hall of Famers [[Kitty Wells]], [[Jimmy Dickens]], and [[Pee Wee King]] as well as many top legends from the Bluegrass genre, from [[Jim and Jesse]] to [[the Lewis Family]]. The ''Christmas Time's A Comin{{'}}'' CD released on Sonlite and MGM/UA was one of the most popular Christmas releases of 1991 and 1992 with Southern retailers.<ref>Gospel Voice (USA)December 1991, pg. 6, by: Edith Kynard, \"From TV to Country to bluegrass, stars join together for drug prevention project\"</ref>\n\nAutry and Franks marked the 20th Anniversary in 2012 with a charity re-release available from the Share America Foundation, Inc.<ref>http://www.chattanoogan.com/2012/11/16/238773/Christmas-CD-Locally-Benefits-North.aspx</ref>\n\n==Music publishing==\n\nFranks opened Peach Picked Publishing associated with Broadcast Music Inc. in the early 1980s focusing initially on the music created by him and his band mates. While he has written songs for large publishing companies including Lowery Music Group, Chris White Music, and Chestnut Mound Publishing, he continues writing for Peach Picked including his hit bluegrass recording \"Filling the River with Tears\", popularized by David Davis and the Warrior River Boys. Eventually, Peach Picked expanded to include work from bluegrass hall of fame members including Chubby Wise and Curly Seckler, Georgia Music Hall of Fame member Cotton Carrier, and recordings by acts including [[Marty Stuart]], [[Ralph Stanley]], [[The Grateful Dead]], and David Davis and the Warrior River Boys. Franks also formed Randall Franks Music to manage the publishing and music catalogs of other artists. In this effort, he has assisted artists in negotiating monies from film, television, and sources around the world, including artists Ramblin' \"Doc\" Tommy Scott, Bill Monroe, Jim and Jesse, Flatt & Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys, and Curly Seckler.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.randallfranks.org/Music_Publishing.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613232628/http://randallfranks.org/Music_Publishing.html |archivedate=2012-06-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Disc jockey==\n\nWhile in college, Franks became part of the cast of the [[WRFG]] radio show ''The Bluegrass Festival'', hosted by T.P. and Sandra Hollomon.
