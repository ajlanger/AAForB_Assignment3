Jason has to take care of the kids: ladies' man Mike ([[Kirk Cameron]]), bookish [[honors student]] Carol ([[Tracey Gold]]), and rambunctious Ben ([[Jeremy Miller]]). A fourth child, Chrissy Seaver (twins Kelsey and Kirsten Dohring; [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]]), is born on October 27, 1988, a day after Ben's 12th birthday.  She was played in her newborn/infant stage by two uncredited sets of twin sisters, that remained in the role until the end of season four (1988\u201389). By season five (1989\u201390), she was played in her toddler stage by alternating twins Kirsten and Kelsey Dohring. In seasons six and seven (1990\u201392), Chrissy's [[Soap opera rapid aging syndrome|age was advanced]] to five years old. A new cast member was added for the seventh and final season (1991\u201392) when homeless teen Luke Brower ([[Leonardo DiCaprio]]) is brought into the Seaver family to live with them until nearly the end of season seven.\n\nOften mentioned but rarely seen are the Seavers' next door neighbors the Koosmans - a reference to the [[1969 New York Mets season|1969 Miracle Mets]].\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Alan Thicke]] as Dr. Jason Roland Seaver\n* [[Joanna Kerns]] as Margaret Katherine \"Maggie\" (n\u00e9e Malone) Seaver\n* [[Kirk Cameron]] as Michael Aaron \"Mike\" Seaver\n* [[Tracey Gold]] as Carol Anne Seaver\n* [[Jeremy Miller]] as Benjamin Hubert Horatio Humphrey \"Ben\"  Seaver\n* [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] as Christine Ellen \"Chrissy\" Seaver (seasons 6\u20137)\n** Kelsey and Kirsten Dohring as Christine Ellen \"Chrissy\" Seaver (toddler) (season 5, alternating)\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Luke Brower (season 7)\n\n=== Recurring ===\n* [[Andrew Koenig]] as Richard Milhous \"Boner\" Stabone (seasons 1\u20134, 25 episodes), Mike's friend; left to join the [[United States Marine Corps]]\n* [[Chelsea Noble]] as Kate MacDonald (seasons 5\u20137, 22 episodes), Mike's girlfriend\n* Jamie Abbott as Stinky Sullivan (seasons 2\u20136, 19 episodes), Ben's friend\n* K.

This is followed by a series of photos of each cast member from their childhood onward ending with a clip from the show. The credits closed with another shot of the cast in front of the Seaver house before they all run inside. Starting in the second season, several different versions of the opening sequence were filmed. Whoever was the last to go into the house would usually be the focus of that week's episode.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe opening used in seasons six and seven featured opening and shot of the mantle on the Seavers' fireplace panning over photos of the cast. The photos of the cast from childhood remained but instead of clips from the show, current still photos were used. Some versions of these credits end with another shot of the mantle while others close with a montage of group shots from the same family photo shoot which the current photos used in the rest of the credits come from.\n\n===Theme song===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nThe show's theme song is \"As Long as We've Got Each Other\", which was written and composed by [[John Bettis]] (lyrics) and [[Steve Dorff]] (music). It was performed by:\n*[[B.J. Thomas]] (singing solo); season 1\n*B.J. Thomas & [[Jennifer Warnes]]; seasons 2, 3, 5, part of 7\n*B.J. Thomas & [[Dusty Springfield]]; season 4\n*[[Joe Chemay]], [[Jim Haas]], Jon Joyce and [[George Merrill (songwriter)|George Merrill]] (singing a capella); season 6, part of 7, series finale\n\nThere were nine versions of the theme song used; others included a Halloween-themed version not sung by Thomas or Warnes used in a two-part Halloween episode in 1990. A shorter version of the Thomas/Warnes version was used starting in season two.\n\nThere was also an [[a cappella]] version of the song which was used for all of season six, but this version was abandoned for most of season seven in favor of the reinstatement of Thomas' and Warnes' duet version, although the a cappella theme returned for three episodes as well as the series finale. A full-length version by Thomas and Springfield was released as a single in 1988.\n\nA soundtrack was released in 1988 titled ''Steve Dorff and Friends: Growing Pains and Other Hit TV Themes.''  The soundtrack contains songs penned by Dorff from his television series theme songs and three tracks from ''Growing Pains'':\n\n# Theme Song \"As Long As We Got Each Other\" (B.J. Thomas and Dusty Springfield)\n# Aloha Episode \u2013 \"Swept Away\" by Christopher Cross\n# Graduation Day Episode \u2013 \"This Is The Day\" performed by B.J. Thomas\n\nThe Theme for Growing Pains got airplay on the Adult Contemporary format in early 1989 and peaked at #5 on the Radio & Records AC chart and #7 on the Billboard AC chart.\n\nAnother version of \"As Long As We Got Each Other\" was performed by [[Louise Mandrell]] and [[Eric Carmen]] in 1988.  Their version peaked at #51 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Country chart.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Growing Pains episodes}}\n{{:List of Growing Pains episodes}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Jason has to take care of the kids: ladies' man Mike ([[Kirk Cameron]]), bookish [[honors student]] Carol ([[Tracey Gold]]), and rambunctious Ben ([[Jeremy Miller]]). A fourth child, Chrissy Seaver (twins Kelsey and Kirsten Dohring; [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]]), is born on October 27, 1988, a day after Ben's 12th birthday.  She was played in her newborn/infant stage by two uncredited sets of twin sisters , that remained in the role until the end of season four (1988-89). By season five (1989\u201390), she was played in her toddler stage by alternating twins Kirsten and Kelsey Dohring. In seasons six and seven (1990\u201392), Chrissy's [[Soap opera rapid aging syndrome|age was advanced]] to five years old. A new cast member was added for the seventh and final season (1991-92) when homeless teen Luke Brower ([[Leonardo DiCaprio]]) is brought into the Seaver family to live with them until nearly the end of season seven.\n\nOften mentioned but rarely seen are the Seavers' next door neighbors the Koosmans - a reference to the [[1969 New York Mets season|1969 Miracle Mets]].\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Alan Thicke]] as Dr. Jason Roland Seaver\n* [[Joanna Kerns]] as Margaret Katherine \"Maggie\" (n\u00e9e Malone) Seaver\n* [[Kirk Cameron]] as Michael Aaron \"Mike\" Seaver\n* [[Tracey Gold]] as Carol Anne Seaver\n* [[Jeremy Miller]] as Benjamin Hubert Horatio Humphrey \"Ben\"  Seaver\n* [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] as Christine Ellen \"Chrissy\" Seaver (seasons 6\u20137)\n** Kelsey and Kirsten Dohring as Christine Ellen \"Chrissy\" Seaver (toddler) (season 5, alternating)\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Luke Brower (season 7)\n\n=== Recurring ===\n* [[Andrew Koenig]] as Richard Milhous \"Boner\" Stabone (seasons 1\u20134, 25 episodes), Mike's friend; left to join the [[United States Marine Corps]]\n* [[Chelsea Noble]] as Kate MacDonald (seasons 5\u20137, 22 episodes), Mike's girlfriend\n* Jamie Abbott as Stinky Sullivan (seasons 2\u20136, 19 episodes), Ben's friend\n* K.

This is followed by a series of photos of each cast member from their childhood onward ending with a clip from the show. The credits closed with another shot of the cast in front of the Seaver house before they all run inside. Starting in the second season, several different versions of the opening sequence were filmed. Whoever was the last to go into the house would usually be the focus of that week's episode.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe opening used in seasons six and seven featured opening and shot of the mantle on the Seavers' fireplace panning over photos of the cast. The photos of the cast from childhood remained but instead of clips from the show, current still photos were used. Some versions of these credits end with another shot of the mantle while others close with a montage of group shots from the same family photo shoot which the current photos used in the rest of the credits come from.\n\n===Theme song===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nThe show's theme song is \"As Long as We've Got Each Other\", which was written and composed by [[John Bettis]] (lyrics) and [[Steve Dorff]] (music). It was performed by:\n*[[B.J. Thomas]] (singing solo); season 1\n*B.J. Thomas & [[Jennifer Warnes]]; seasons 2, 3, 5, part of 7\n*B.J. Thomas & [[Dusty Springfield]]; season 4\n*[[Joe Chemay]], [[Jim Haas]], Jon Joyce and [[George Merrill (songwriter)|George Merrill]] (singing a capella); season 6, part of 7, series finale\n\nThere were nine versions of the theme song used; others included a Halloween-themed version not sung by Thomas or Warnes used in a two-part Halloween episode in 1990. A shorter version of the Thomas/Warnes version was used starting in season two.\n\nThere was also an [[a cappella]] version of the song which was used for all of season six, but this version was abandoned for most of season seven in favor of the reinstatement of Thomas' and Warnes' duet version, although the a cappella theme returned for three episodes as well as the series finale. A full-length version by Thomas and Springfield was released as a single in 1988.\n\nA soundtrack was released in 1988 titled ''Steve Dorff and Friends: Growing Pains and Other Hit TV Themes.''  The soundtrack contains songs penned by Dorff from his television series theme songs and three tracks from ''Growing Pains'':\n\n# Theme Song \"As Long As We Got Each Other\" (B.J. Thomas and Dusty Springfield)\n# Aloha Episode \u2013 \"Swept Away\" by Christopher Cross\n# Graduation Day Episode \u2013 \"This Is The Day\" performed by B.J. Thomas\n\nThe Theme for Growing Pains got airplay on the Adult Contemporary format in early 1989 and peaked at #5 on the Radio & Records AC chart and #7 on the Billboard AC chart. \n\nAnother version of \"As Long As We Got Each Other\" was performed by [[Louise Mandrell]] and [[Eric Carmen]] in 1988.  Their version peaked at #51 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Country chart.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Growing Pains episodes}}\n{{:List of Growing Pains episodes}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
