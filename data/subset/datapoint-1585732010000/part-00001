He immediately resumes charge of his old gang and soon confronts Loganathan, a [[drug smuggling|drug smuggler]]. Loga insults Kumudha, saying that she would have been sold into prostitution had she been alive. In retaliation, Kabali rams his car into Loga, killing him; however, the incident makes him believe that his wife may be still alive. Later, Kabali survives an assassination attempt by Tamizh Kumaran alias Kumaran, whose father Tamilmaaran was killed by Kabali when Kumaran was a young boy. The next day, at a function organised by the Free Life Foundation School, a school started by Kabali's friend Ameer to reform youngsters involved in criminal activities, Kabali talks about his past.\n\nKabali was the protege of Tamilmaaran's father Tamilnesan, a don who fought for the rights of [[Tamil Malaysians]]. Tamilnesan was killed by Veerasekaran, a member of his gang who disliked his rules such as not involving in illegal activities like drug smuggling and prostitution. Following Tamilnesan's death, Kabali took charge of Tamilnesan's gang. Veera manipulated Tamilmaaran by telling him that he, being Tamilnesan's son, should lead the gang and not Kabali. Tamilmaaran invited Kabali and a pregnant Kumudha for a temple function. However, this was revealed to be a trap as Veera and his men confronted Kabali and Kumudha at the function. In the ensuing scuffle, Kabali was brutally attacked while Kumudha was shot and seemingly killed. Kabali then killed Tamilmaaran for his betrayal in front of a young Kumaran and was soon arrested on a false charge of instigating the massacre.\n\nKumaran, after hearing Kabali's speech, realises his mistake and apologises to him. He tells him that Velu, one of Veera's henchmen who was present at the temple massacre, is aware of what happened to Kumudha. Kabali then leaves for [[Thailand]], where Velu is residing. On confronting Velu, he learns that his daughter is still alive. At this juncture, Kabali is confronted by Yogi, a [[contract killing|contract killer]] hired by Veera and his boss Tony Lee, who heads the rival Gang 43 in Kuala Lumpur, to eliminate Kabali. Yogi instead kills the men who had come with her and reveals herself to Kabali as his daughter, who had been raised by Velu. She also tells him that Kumudha is still alive and is living with a French family in [[Pondicherry|Puducherry]]. Kabali and Yogi then leave for Puducherry, where, after several days of searching, they reunite with Kumudha and spend a few days with her there. While in Puducherry, Kabali and his family are attacked by men sent by Tony. However, Kabali and Yogi fight them off and escape safely with Kumudha.\n\nKabali and his family soon return to Kuala Lumpur, where he is told that Ameer has been severely injured in a car accident set up by Tony; his henchman Jeeva was brutally chopped to pieces by Tony after refusing to join Gang 43; and Gang 43 had destroyed the Free Life Foundation School and started to control the Kuala Lumpur underworld, eliminating any gang who dared to oppose them. On hearing all this, Kabali decides to finish Veera and Tony. He and his family attend the 100th birthday party for a respected Malaysian don Ang Lee, who had invited all gangs, including Gang 43. At the party, Kabali starts a shootout with the help of Kumaran, which ends with him killing Veera and Tony.\n\nSome months later, Kabali, Kumudha, Kumaran, and Yogi attend a function organised by the Free Life Foundation. One of the Free Life alumni, a youngster named Tiger, who is known to be aggressive and reckless, walks up to Kabali, with scenes showing him speaking to the police prior to the function. The screen cuts to black, and the sound of a gun clicking and a gunshot afterwards is heard.<!--do ''not'' write that the film ends ambiguously as it may show POV-->\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Kabaliswaran (Kabali), the head of Malaysian Gangster group '00'.\n* [[Radhika Apte]] as Kumudhavalli Kabaliswaran, Kabali's wife\n* [[Sai Dhanshika]] as Yogitha Kabaleeswaran, Kabali's daughter who is a contract killer in Thailand.\n* [[Winston Chao]] as Tony Lee, industrialist, businessman and a head of Malaysian Gangster group '43'.\n* [[Kishore (actor)|Kishore]] as Veerasekaran, the second head of '43'\n* [[Attakathi Dinesh|Dinesh]] as Jeeva, Kabali's gang member.\n* [[Kalaiyarasan]] as Thamizh Kumaran (Kumaran), Tamizh Nesan's grandson and Tamizh Maran's son.

He immediately resumes charge of his old gang and soon confronts Loganathan, a [[drug smuggling|drug smuggler]]. Loga insults Kumudha, saying that she would have been sold into prostitution had she been alive. In retaliation, Kabali rams his car into Loga, killing him; however, the incident makes him believe that his wife may be still alive. Later, Kabali survives an assassination attempt by Tamizh Kumaran alias Kumaran, whose father Tamilmaaran was killed by Kabali when Kumaran was a young boy. The next day, at a function organised by the Free Life Foundation School, a school started by Kabali's friend Ameer to reform youngsters involved in criminal activities, Kabali talks about his past.\n\nKabali was the protege of Tamilmaaran's father Tamilnesan, a don who fought for the rights of [[Tamil Malaysians]]. Tamilnesan was killed by Veerasekaran, a member of his gang who disliked his rules such as not involving in illegal activities like drug smuggling and prostitution. Following Tamilnesan's death, Kabali took charge of Tamilnesan's gang. Veera manipulated Tamilmaaran by telling him that he, being Tamilnesan's son, should lead the gang and not Kabali. Tamilmaaran invited Kabali and a pregnant Kumudha for a temple function. However, this was revealed to be a trap as Veera and his men confronted Kabali and Kumudha at the function. In the ensuing scuffle, Kabali was brutally attacked while Kumudha was shot and seemingly killed. Kabali then killed Tamilmaaran for his betrayal in front of a young Kumaran and was soon arrested on a false charge of instigating the massacre.\n\nKumaran, after hearing Kabali's speech, realises his mistake and apologises to him. He tells him that Velu, one of Veera's henchmen who was present at the temple massacre, is aware of what happened to Kumudha. Kabali then leaves for [[Thailand]], where Velu is residing. On confronting Velu, he learns that his daughter is still alive. At this juncture, Kabali is confronted by Yogi, a [[contract killing|contract killer]] hired by Veera and his boss Tony Lee, who heads the rival Gang 43 in Kuala Lumpur, to eliminate Kabali. Yogi instead kills the men who had come with her and reveals herself to Kabali as his daughter, who had been raised by Velu. She also tells him that Kumudha is still alive and is living with a French family in [[Pondicherry|Puducherry]]. Kabali and Yogi then leave for Puducherry, where, after several days of searching, they reunite with Kumudha and spend a few days with her there. While in Puducherry, Kabali and his family are attacked by men sent by Tony. However, Kabali and Yogi fight them off and escape safely with Kumudha.\n\nKabali and his family soon return to Kuala Lumpur, where he is told that Ameer has been severely injured in a car accident set up by Tony; his henchman Jeeva was brutally chopped to pieces by Tony after refusing to join Gang 43; and Gang 43 had destroyed the Free Life Foundation School and started to control the Kuala Lumpur underworld, eliminating any gang who dared to oppose them. On hearing all this, Kabali decides to finish Veera and Tony. He and his family attend the 100th birthday party for a respected Malaysian don Ang Lee, who had invited all gangs, including Gang 43. At the party, Kabali starts a shootout with the help of Kumaran, which ends with him killing Veera and Tony.\n\nSome months later, Kabali, Kumudha, Kumaran, and Yogi attend a function organised by the Free Life Foundation. One of the Free Life alumni, a youngster named Tiger, who is known to be aggressive and reckless, walks up to Kabali, with scenes showing him speaking to the police prior to the function. The screen cuts to black, and the sound of a gun clicking and a gunshot afterwards is heard.<!--do ''not'' write that the film ends ambiguously as it may show POV-->\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Kabaliswaran (Kabali), the head of Malaysian Gangster group '00'.\n* [[Radhika Apte]] as Kumudhavalli Kabaliswaran, Kabali's wife\n* [[Sai Dhanshika]] as Yogitha Kabaleeswaran, Kabali's daughter who is a contract killer in Thailand.\n* [[Winston Chao]] as Tony Lee, industrialist, businessman and a head of Malaysian Gangster group '43'.\n* [[Kishore (actor)|Kishore]] as Veerasekaran, the second head of '43'\n* [[Attakathi Dinesh|Dinesh]] as Jeeva, Kabali's gang member.\n* [[Kalaiyarasan]] as Thamizh Kumaran (Kumaran), Tamizh Nesan's grandson and Tamizh Maran's son.
