(later '''NeXT Computer, Inc.''' and '''NeXT Software, Inc.''') was an American [[computer]] and [[software]] company founded in 1985 by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. Its name was usually pronounced as \"'''Next'''\". Based in [[Redwood City, California]], the company developed and manufactured a series of [[computer workstation]]s intended for the [[higher education]] and business markets. NeXT was founded by Jobs after he was forced out of Apple, along with several co-workers NeXT introduced the first [[NeXT Computer]] in 1988, and the smaller [[NeXTstation]] in 1990. The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, their innovative [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[NeXTSTEP]] [[operating system]] and [[development environment]] ([[Interface Builder]]) were highly influential.  \n\nThe first major outside investment was from [[Ross Perot]], who invested after seeing a segment about NeXT on a 1986 [[PBS]] documentary titled ''Entrepreneurs''.<ref name=\"RP iPhone\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90374043/how-ross-perot-helped-bring-us-the-iphone|title=How Ross Perot befriended Steve Jobs and helped bring us the iPhone|last=McCracken|first=Harry|date=2019-07-09|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> In 1987, he invested $20 million in exchange for 16 percent of NeXT's stock and subsequently joined the board of directors in 1988.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|url-access=registration|title=iCon: Steve Jobs|last=Young|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Simon|first2=William L.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-72083-6|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff/page/134 134]}}</ref>\n\nNeXT later released much of the NeXTSTEP system as a [[Application programming interface|programming environment]] standard called [[OpenStep]]. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing [[OpenStep#OPENSTEP for Mach|OPENSTEP for Mach]], its own OpenStep implementation, for several [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs). NeXT also developed [[WebObjects]], one of the first enterprise [[Web framework|web application frameworks]]. WebObjects never became very popular because of its initial high price of $50,000, but it remains a prominent early example of a [[Web server]] based on [[Dynamic web page|dynamic page generation]] rather than on [[static content]].\n\nApple purchased NeXT in 1997 for $429 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|USD|429|1997}} million in {{Inflation-year|USD}}) and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock.

The new range included a revised NeXT Computer, renamed the [[NeXTcube]], and the [[NeXTstation]], nicknamed \"the slab\" for its form-factor of a low-rise box. Jobs was explicit in ensuring NeXT staff did not use the nickname \"[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]\", so that the NeXT machines would not be compared to competing Sun workstations which already had that nickname. The magneto-optical drive was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive but 2.88 MB floppy disks were expensive and the technology did not supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT utilized the [[CD-ROM]] drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and on the [[NeXTdimension]] [[Video card|graphics processor]] hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers were cheaper and faster than their predecessors, with the new [[Motorola 68040]] processor.\n\nIn 1992, NeXT launched \"Turbo\" variants of the NeXTcube and NeXTstation with a 33 MHz 68040 processor and maximum RAM capacity increased to 128 MB. NeXT sold 20,000 computers in 1992, and NeXT counted upgraded motherboards on back order as system sales.

Initially the NRW was to be based on the [[Motorola 88000#Implementations|Motorola 88110]] processor, but due to a lack of confidence in Motorola's commitment to the 88000-series architecture, it was later redesigned around dual [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 601|PowerPC 601s]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/NextWorld_Extra/93.03.Mar.NWE/93.03.Mar.NWExtra21.html|title=Hardware was great while it lasted|last=Garfinkel|first=Simson L.|date=March 1993|website=NeXTWORLD|accessdate=June 13, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/NextWorld_Extra/93.03.Mar.NWE/93.03.Mar.NWExtra07.html|title=Canon to buy NeXT factory, design center|last=Lavin|first=Dan|date=March 1993|website=NeXTWORLD|url-status=live|accessdate=June 13, 2008}}</ref> NeXT produced some motherboards and enclosures, but exited the hardware business before full production.\n\n====Software applications====\nNeXT computers were delivered with [[Mathematica]] pre-installed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mathematica25.com/1987_nextsignson-2/|title=Mathematica \u2014 Celebrating 25 Years of Contributions, Invention, Discovery, and Education:  Nov. 1987: Steve Jobs signs on to bundle Mathematica with every NeXT computer...|work=mathematica25.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125123920/http://mathematica25.com/1987_nextsignson-2/|archivedate=November 25, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Several developers used the NeXT platform to write pioneering programs.

Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a \"community\" with \"members\" instead of employees. There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid {{US$|75000|1986}} and those who joined afterward were paid {{US$|50000|1986}}. This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months because of the spartan salary plans. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever took advantage of the privilege. NeXT's [[health insurance]] plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried couples and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|80}} The payroll schedule was also very different from other companies in Silicon Valley at the time because instead of being delivered twice a month in arrears at the end of the pay period, it was delivered once a month in advance.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|289}}\n\nJobs found office space in [[Palo Alto, California]] on 3475 Deer Creek Road, occupying a glass and concrete building which featured a staircase designed by architect [[I. M. Pei]]. The first floor used hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in-time]] (JIT) inventory strategy. The company contracted out for all major [[wikt:component|components]] such as mainboards and cases and had the finished components shipped to the first floor for assembly. The second floor was the office space with an open floor plan. The only enclosed rooms were Jobs's office and a few conference rooms.<ref name=\"AppleConfidential\">{{Cite book | first=Owen W. | last=Linzmayer | title=Apple Confidential 2.0 | publisher=No Starch Press | year=2004 |isbn=1-59327-010-0}}</ref>{{rp|323}}\n\nAs NeXT expanded, more office space was needed. The company rented an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive in Redwood City, also designed by Pei. The architectural centerpiece was a \"floating\" staircase with no visible supports. The open floor plan was retained, although furnishings became luxurious, with $5,000 chairs, $10,000 sofas, and [[Ansel Adams]] prints.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|80}}\n\nNeXT's first campus in Palo Alto was subsequently occupied by [[SAP SE|SAP AG]].

(later '''NeXT Computer, Inc.''' and '''NeXT Software, Inc.''') was an American [[computer]] and [[software]] company founded in 1985 by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. Its name was usually pronounced as \"'''Next'''\". Based in [[Redwood City, California]], the company developed and manufactured a series of [[computer workstation]]s intended for the [[higher education]] and business markets. NeXT was founded by Jobs after he was forced out of Apple, along with several co-workers NeXT introduced the first [[NeXT Computer]] in 1988, and the smaller [[NeXTstation]] in 1990. The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, their innovative [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[NeXTSTEP]] [[operating system]] and [[development environment]] ([[Interface Builder]]) were highly influential.  \n\nThe first major outside investment was from [[Ross Perot]], who invested after seeing a segment about NeXT on a 1986 [[PBS]] documentary titled ''Entrepreneurs''.<ref name=\"RP iPhone\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90374043/how-ross-perot-helped-bring-us-the-iphone|title=How Ross Perot befriended Steve Jobs and helped bring us the iPhone|last=McCracken|first=Harry|date=2019-07-09|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> In 1987, he invested $20 million in exchange for 16 percent of NeXT's stock and subsequently joined the board of directors in 1988.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|url-access=registration|title=iCon: Steve Jobs|last=Young|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Simon|first2=William L.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-72083-6|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff/page/134 134]}}</ref>\n\nNeXT later released much of the NeXTSTEP system as a [[Application programming interface|programming environment]] standard called [[OpenStep]]. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing [[OpenStep#OPENSTEP for Mach|OPENSTEP for Mach]], its own OpenStep implementation, for several [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs). NeXT also developed [[WebObjects]], one of the first enterprise [[Web framework|web application frameworks]]. WebObjects never became very popular because of its initial high price of $50,000, but it remains a prominent early example of a [[Web server]] based on [[Dynamic web page|dynamic page generation]] rather than on [[static content]].\n\nApple purchased NeXT in 1997 for $400 million and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock. The merger converted Steve Jobs from Chairman and CEO of NeXT to an advisory role at Apple, the company he had co-founded in 1976;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-acquires-next-jobs/|title=Apple acquires Next, Jobs|last=Kawamoto|first=Dawn|date=|website=CNET|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200315025703/https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-acquires-next-jobs/|archive-date=15 Mar 2020|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> and it promised to port NeXT's operating system to Macintosh hardware, combine it with the legacy application layer of [[Mac OS]], and yield [[OS X]].{{primary source inline|date=January 2020}}<ref>{{Cite press release|title=Apple Computer, Inc.

Wet labs were prohibitively expensive for lower-level courses and were too complex to be simulated on personal computers of the time.

The new range included a revised NeXT Computer, renamed the [[NeXTcube]], and the [[NeXTstation]], nicknamed \"the slab\" for its form-factor of a low-rise box. Jobs was explicit in ensuring NeXT staff did not use the nickname \"[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]\", so that the NeXT machines would not be compared to competing Sun workstations which already had that nickname. The magneto-optical drive was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive but 2.88 MB floppy disks were expensive and the technology did not supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT utilized the [[CD-ROM]] drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and on the [[NeXTdimension]] [[Video card|graphics processor]] hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers were cheaper and faster than their predecessors, with the new [[Motorola 68040]] processor.\n\nIn 1992, NeXT launched \"Turbo\" variants of the NeXTcube and NeXTstation with a 33 MHz 68040 processor and maximum RAM capacity increased to 128 MB. NeXT sold 20,000 computers in 1992, and NeXT counted upgraded motherboards on back order as system sales. This is a small number compared with competitors, but the company reported sales of $140 million for the year which encouraged Canon to invest a further $30 million to keep the company afloat.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|url-access=registration|title=iCon: Steve Jobs|last=Young|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Simon|first2=William L.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-72083-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff/page/200 200]}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box | width=25% | align=right | text=In its existence, Next has sold a total of 50,000 copies of Nextstep, says Jobs.

Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a \"community\" with \"members\" instead of employees. There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid {{US$|75000|1986}} and those who joined afterward were paid {{US$|50000|1986}}. This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months because of the spartan salary plans. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever took advantage of the privilege. NeXT's [[health insurance]] plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried couples and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|80}} The payroll schedule was also very different from other companies in Silicon Valley at the time because instead of being delivered twice a month in arrears at the end of the pay period, it was delivered once a month in advance.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|289}}\n\nJobs found office space in [[Palo Alto, California]] on 3475 Deer Creek Road, occupying a glass and concrete building which featured a staircase designed by architect [[I. M. Pei]]. The first floor used hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in-time]] (JIT) inventory strategy. The company contracted out for all major [[wikt:component|components]] such as mainboards and cases and had the finished components shipped to the first floor for assembly. The second floor was the office space with an open floor plan.

The company rented an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive in Redwood City, also designed by Pei. The architectural centerpiece was a \"floating\" staircase with no visible supports.
