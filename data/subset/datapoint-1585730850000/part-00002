The cemetery is located on Las Delicias Avenue in the city of [[Maracaibo]], the capital of [[Zulia State]], west of the South American country of [[Venezuela]]. It is one of the oldest operating historical cemeteries in the country and Latin America overall, being officially established on [[November 12]] of [[1879]], but people were buried there as early as [[1821]]. The cemetery had many names since foundation, starting with no name, later in [[1925]] New Cemetery, New Square and The Square due to its particular form. Since September 2019 it holds the new current name The Square Luxburg-Carolath.\n\n== History ==\nIn the State of Zulia, as in all of Venezuela, there were different types of cemeteries, including local Indian burials pre-German foundation of the city. With the arrival of the Spanish after the German foundation of Maracaibo coro and other important cities of the future Zulia State, it was a Christian custom, to bury the deceased next to the churches in convents and attached lands they established. The Spanish Crown, in 1698, ordered to bury the deceased next to the parish churches. This law is changed by decree of the Liberator [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], in the year 1827, forcing the dead to be buried in special lands destined for such purposes. Thus began the regular cemeteries separated from the Churches and city centers. Following these rules, the Cemetery of Maracaibo, or \u201cOld Cemetery\u201d, was created in 1821, on land located behind the San Juan de Dios church on El Transito street. The cemetery was closed in 1880. Original cemeteries existed three cemeteries' main ancient The Colonial Cemetery (Old Cemetery or General Cemetery of Maracaibo) was inaugurated in 1821, the Cemetery of the Germans (1824) and the Cemetery of Saint Lucia (1881). These cemeteries were looted for the theft of their marbles and other materials or eliminated to perform civil works in the year of 1942. The remains of the deceased that were left were transferred to The Square, where Columbaries of 2 and 3 floors were made to accommodate them, they transferred them to The Square simply because it was the closest cemetery to transport the dead. \n \n[[File:Mapa_aereo_casco_central_Maracaibo_1940.png|thumbnail|aerial view in 1940 of the Luxburg-Catolath Square Cemetery]]\nThe foreign resident colony in Maracaibo, founded in 1824 and closed in 1942, what was known as the cemetery of English, Foreigners or Cementerio de Los Alemanes, (The name \u201cEnglish\u201d (ingleses)  name was actually at that time the same as Foreigners a synonym that today is also used as Gringos) the deceased of that cemetery were mostly English and German Protestants, also Jews because they did not have their cemetery and the Protestants got along with the Jews in Maracaibo and other places, there was no religious antipathy at that time between them, was a neighbor of the Colonial cemetery also on El Transit street, on the grounds of the current Panorama Newspaper (one of biggest in Venezuela). The cemetery of foreigners was also actually the main cement maker of all Protestant Christians in Maracaibo, not only Protestant Germans, but Protestant Englishmen and many other different European nationalities and beliefs were buried there. For the simple reason that at that time there was some \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d of these religions of the great majority of Venezuelans who were devout Catholics to the Christianity of the Roman Catholic Church. We cannot say that there was religious persecution in Venezuela, but if a certain antipathy based on misunderstanding or simply little culture of the population. Maracaibo is a unique city in South America, it was founded by Germans, Ambrosio Alfinger on 8 September 1528. That date is today considered and officially celebrated as the day of the foundation of the city. After the independence of Venezuela, trade between Europe and mainly North Germany, Great Britain, France to Venezuela increased, mainly influenced by the favorable support of Germany France and Britain to Venezuelan independence war, many Germans and British participated militarily as officers and soldiers in the war of independence for Venezuela. Product of this fact an infinity of these and others that were progressively reaching Venezuela, Maracaibo and the port of La Guaira.\n[[File:Cementerio ingleses.png|thumbnail|English Cemetery see box]]\n[[File:Cementerio ingles paredes.png|thumbnail|Adjacencies of the Old English Cemetery]]\nMaracaibo was the largest city in Venezuela in the north and Venezuela's \"continental\" guide. The first deep port of South America in the Atlantic Ocean. Citizens of many European countries began arriving in Venezuela. as well as from the United States of America, being mostly practitioners of religions and cults different from the main Venezuelan religion the Roman Catholic Church. We have to understand that there were also many Masons among all these people - who joined each other without differentiating race or nationality religion. At that time there was a lot of rivalry and negativity from the Venezuelan Catholic clergy to other religions or branches of Christianity.\n\nFor example, In Guaira, the English Consul Sir Robert Kerr Porter, and C.D. Strohm, M. Wolff, Otto Winckelmann, H. Stall, C.C. Nolting, and R. Roosen Runge founded the Aliens Cemetery Society in La Guaira. Mr. Robert Syers sold them land between the Guanapa River and Punta de Mulato, and that was part of his stay in Guanapa.\n\nThe Square (El Cuadrado), officially founded on November 12, 1879, because it was baptized that date, founded it was some years before, built by private shareholders like many of the cemeteries in Venezuela, and so it is today, known as The Square(El Cuadrado), for having the perfect shape of a fairly proportional quadrilateral 200 x 200 meters. Hermes Romero made its architectural design. Here is a certain format for discussion, because we know that on November 12, 1879, it was actually baptized as a cemetery and the foundation was several years before. At first, the cemetery was simply called the New Cemetery because it was the newest in the city at that time, the Marabinos actually named it The Square which was officially registered in 1925 by the Troconis family in the official name. The Square lost its shape, almost perfect square, at the time of President Rafael Caldera during the reconstruction of Maracaibo of its tracks - in part on its land two apartment buildings were built. The foundation of El Cuadrado coincided with the attack of the yellow fever epidemic on Maracaibo. The Square for the year 1900, is the urban limit of the city of Maracaibo. Many are the works of sculptural and historical value, there lie many of the Zulian characters of Independence and prominent Zulians, from other times. Jes\u00fas Enrique Losada, Ismael Urdaneta, Francisco Ochoa, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo, the Belloso family, Rinc\u00f3n, Osorio, Cook, Arria, Von Jess, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Borjas Romero, Juice, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Y\u00e9pez, Manuel Dagnino, Antonio Jos\u00e9 Urquinaona, Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n, Guillermo Quintero Luzardo, Eduardo Mathias Losada, Julio \u00c1rraga, Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez, families, as some of the best-known men and families in Venezuela and Latin America. In addition to El Cuadrado, another of the old cemeteries, now disappeared, was the cemetery of Santa Lucia, opened on January 30, 1881, and also closed in 1942. And it is not a new claim, the Panorama newspaper in its edition of January 7 In 2006, he published a report where the journalist Pa\u00fal Ram\u00edrez Mora said that 40 antisocials were living there and that more than 96,000 souls rested on 800 square meters in El Cuadrado. The Luxburg-Carolath Square cemetery is made up of four cemeteries, which are the colonial cemetery, the English cemetery, the Saint Lucia cemetery and The Square Luxburg-Carolath itself. Which makes it unique in Venezuela and Latin America.\n\nThe cemetery The Square Luxburg-Carolath, when it was built, was 200 x 200 meters. It was built in a classic style (classicism), due to the influence of the European colony in Maracaibo. The cemetery is the most famous, and oldest operational cemetery in Zulia and Venezuela, the most historical, not only because of its architecture but also because of the vast majority of the personalities that formed the splendor Maracaibo, Zulia and Venezuela that rest in peace there. Fine marble monuments brought from Italy each piece with spectacular details. Unique exquisite works composed of all known Architectural styles. The terrible \u201cSpanish flu\u201d or \u201cel trancazo\u201d, which in 1918 ended, according to data from the time with 800-1000 maracaiberos (citizens of Maracaibo), which represented in a population of about 36,000 souls, a mortality rate, from the flu, near 3%, similar to the world death rate. This was that of every 100 marabinos 50 were sick and about 3 died from the flu. It is understood because it prevented the procession of the Virgen de la Chiquinquir\u00e1 from leaving the old Saladillo neighborhood miraculously. \"Many souls received The Square in that epidemic.\" Actually, El Cuadrado is not just a historical treasure of Zulia or Maracaibo because of its architecture, it is mainly the only historical cemetery that houses 3 cemeteries in it and all possible major world religions. Catholics, Jews, Protestants and who knows who else. It is something unique in Venezuela.\n\nThe cemetery has about 1000 tombs which hold 10,364 dead people among whose graves, niches and pantheons have been buried in Zulian illustrious as the hero of independence Antonio Pulgar; the immortal rector of University of Zulia, Jes\u00fas Enrique Losada; the poet Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez; the doctor and scientist Humberto Fern\u00e1ndez Mor\u00e1n; the precursor of the national cinema Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n; the artist Julio \u00c1rraga; Dr. Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo; the creator of the university city, Antonio Borjas Romero; the magnate of the missing Bella Vista Castle, Lucas Evangelista Rinc\u00f3n; Don Manuel Belloso, founder of Cobeca and the \"saint\" Fray Junipero, whose body is said to remain intact in his coffin and becomes incredibly heavy if they try to move it. Isaiah chapter 14, verse 19 states: \"But you have been cast out of your sepulcher as a rejected rod.\" Today in the cemeteries, no grave enjoys privacy; the holy rest is interrupted amorally. Nowadays many times life is not respected and less death.\n\n== Description ==\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer counts that they have desecrated the great majority of the graves. \u201cThere is a depraved crime. There is no moral, nor respect for the deceased, for values, \u201dhe lamented. The buried body of a person takes 8 years to exhume and transfer the remains to the ossuary and the criminals opt for those that are more than 100 years old, that is, from 1920 onwards. Most are shattered. \u201cThe graves have very large marble vases, and they grab it to break the ossuaries. Mr. Ferrer estimated that of the 10 thousand three hundred people buried in El Cuadrado, and about 15 thousand dead in a unique separate vault called \u201cEl Carnero\u201d which is 50 meter deep, of which 40-50% is already abandoned, since \u201cthey have been lost because they are very old, or because relatives left them abandoned \"\n\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer, current worker of the El Cuadrado cemetery, his family has a long history related to the cemetery since the first worker Heriberto Hern\u00e1ndez for 45 years of service. He was the grandfather's father-in-law, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ferrer, of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer. Then came the grandfather who was 72 years in total. When the grandfather dies, Pope Nilo Enrique Ferrer Hern\u00e1ndez comes with 52 years of service, who died in 2011 and since that year Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer is the queeping with the tradition.\n\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer supervised and organized all the works in the cemetery by the Foundation Luxburg-Carolath to the cemetery. He was, with all his coworkers, the most important human factor in the entire organization since day one of all works. He and the history of his family related to all the time that the cemetery exists since its foundation is a separate story of Marabinos dedicated to their work of a family dynasty.\n\nSeveral tombs in the square have bars on top built by relatives who thought that would save them from thief and tomb raiders. They didn't help much. The bars were forced the desecrated tombs - the undergrowth emptied and they went into oblivion until the general cleaning. A common Venezuelan construction in our cemeteries that in our opinion have very few analogs in the world. By restoring cemeteries and putting all souls to rest in peace, we have in our opinion to leave as a memory to the time of tomb raiders and complete desolation. It didn't work, all the graves were perpetrated and stolen without any difference. Many activists and hired people worked during this work that seems simple at first but it was a difficult task because it is not a simple work yard it is a cemetery.\n\n== Characteristic of The Square Luxburg-Carolath Cemetery ==\nIn Maracaibo, the Colonial Cemetery (Old Cemetery or General Cemetery of Maracaibo) was opened in 1829, the Cemetery of the Germans opened 1834 and the Cemetery of Saint Lucia opened 1881. These cemeteries were sawn to perform civil works in the city in the year of 1942. The remains of the deceased who were left were transferred to the El Cuadrado cemetery simply because they were the closest to them. Columbariums were built in El Cuadrado to accommodate the deceased of the cemeteries. That is why the square cemetery is unique in Venezuela, it houses 3 other cemeteries since 1829, forming only one on 4, there are four cemeteries together in one. Like the city of Maracaibo. It is also called Athens of Latin America, the city of the 3 foundations. It is the most famous and ancient in Maracaibo and Zulia. The Columbariums today are in a total state of looting, deterioration, and perpetration. The reconstruction project of the cemetery carries the historical inclusion of the 3 cemeteries and their families.\n\n== Mixed Unique Architecture ==\nThe Square (El Cuadrado) is considered as an outstanding work of Funeral and Religious Art. The one that shows how Maracaibo el Zulia and Venezuela lived and developed. It is common to say that countries/governments and their level of civilization are judged by how they treat their deceased and their jailed citizens. The development of cemeteries the style of their graves is a unique contribution to the entity of any community in the world. It has almost all styles of architecture made such as Neoclassical, Classic, Naco (vulgar), Humble, Eclecticism, Gothic, Contemporary, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, with endless variations of their own given by family members. One of the few examples of different styles of architecture: Art Nouveau is represented by Fernandez Moran, Coronell Francisco Aguirre. Pantheon Electrico family Quintero designed by Hermes Romero (the same architect that designed The Square) Tomb of the Losada family inspired by the temple of classical antiquity and others that will be described separately. All known styles in one way or another are presented in the cemetery.\n\n== Owner and Administration ==\n'''The Grafen von Luxburg Family Foundation, F\u00fcrsten zu Carolath-Beuthen und Prinzen von Schoenaich-Carolath''' is a civil, charitable and non-profit foundation founded on June 14, 1940, by [[Karl von Luxburg]]; She is the owner and administrator of the Cemetery Luxburg-Carolath Square since August 2019.\n\n'''Karl Ludwig Graf von Luxburg, F\u00fcrst zu Carolath-Beuthen und Prinz von Schoenaich-Carolath, Minister and Ambassador of the German Empire during World War I.'''

With the arrival of the Spanish after the German foundation of Maracaibo coro and other important cities of the future Zulia State, it was Christian custom, to bury the deceased next to the churches, convents and attached lands they established.

This law is changed by decree of the Liberator [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], in the year 1827, forcing the dead to be buried in special lands destined for such purposes. Thus began the specialized cemeteries separated from the Churches and city centers. Following these rules, the General Cemetery of Maracaibo, or \u201cOld Cemetery\u201d, was created in 1821, on land located behind the San Juan de Dios church, on El Transito street, which was closed in 1880. Original cemeteries existed three cemeteries' main ancient The Colonial Cemetery (Old Cemetery or General Cemetery of Maracaibo) was inaugurated in 1821, the Cemetery of the Germans (1824) and the Cemetery of Saint Lucia (1881).

The cemetery of foreigners was also actually the main cement maker of all Protestant Christians in Maracaibo, not only Protestant Germans, but Protestant Englishmen and many other different European nationalities and beliefs were buried there. For the simple reason that at that time there was some \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d of these religions of the great majority of Venezuelans who were devout Catholics to the Christianity of the Roman Catholic Church. We cannot say that there was religious persecution in Venezuela, but if a certain antipathy based on misunderstanding or simply little culture of the population. Maracaibo is a unique city in South America, it was founded by Germans, Ambrosio Alfinger on 8 September 1528. That date is today considered and officially celebrated as the day of the foundation of the city. After the independence of Venezuela, trade between Europe and mainly North Germany, Great Britain, France to Venezuela increased, mainly influenced by the favorable support of Germany France and Britain to Venezuelan independence war, many Germans and British participated militarily as officers and soldiers in the war of independence for Venezuela. Product of this fact an infinity of these and others that were progressively reaching Venezuela, Maracaibo and the port of La Guaira.\n[[File:Cementerio ingleses.png|thumbnail|English Cemetery see box]]\n[[File:Cementerio ingles paredes.png|thumbnail|Adjacencies of the Old English Cemetery]]\nMaracaibo was the largest city in Venezuela in the north and Venezuela's \"continental\" guide. The first deep port of South America in the Atlantic Ocean. Citizens of many European countries began arriving in Venezuela. as well as from the United States of America, being mostly practitioners of religions and cults different from the main Venezuelan religion the Roman Catholic Church. We have to understand that there were also many Masons among all these people - who joined each other without differentiating race or nationality religion. At that time there was a lot of rivalry and negativity from the Venezuelan Catholic clergy to other religions or branches of Christianity.\n\nFor example, In Guaira, the English Consul Sir Robert Kerr Porter, and C.D. Strohm, M. Wolff, Otto Winckelmann, H. Stall, C.C. Nolting, and R. Roosen Runge founded the Aliens Cemetery Society in La Guaira. Mr. Robert Syers sold them land between the Guanapa River and Punta de Mulato, and that was part of his stay in Guanapa.\n\nThe Square (El Cuadrado), officially founded on November 12, 1879, because it was baptized that date, founded it was some years before, built by private shareholders like many of the cemeteries in Venezuela, and so it is today, known as The Square(El Cuadrado), for having the perfect shape of a fairly proportional quadrilateral 200 x 200 meters. Hermes Romero made its architectural design. Here is a certain format for discussion, because we know that on November 12, 1879, it was actually baptized as a cemetery and the foundation was several years before. At first, the cemetery was simply called the New Cemetery because it was the newest in the city at that time, the Marabinos actually named it The Square which was officially registered in 1925 by the Troconis family in the official name. The Square lost its shape, almost perfect square, at the time of President Rafael Caldera during the reconstruction of Maracaibo of its tracks - in part on its land two apartment buildings were built. The foundation of El Cuadrado coincided with the attack of the yellow fever epidemic on Maracaibo. The Square for the year 1900, is the urban limit of the city of Maracaibo. Many are the works of sculptural and historical value, there lie many of the Zulian characters of Independence and prominent Zulians, from other times. Jes\u00fas Enrique Losada, Ismael Urdaneta, Francisco Ochoa, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo, the Belloso family, Rinc\u00f3n, Osorio, Cook, Arria, Von Jess, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Borjas Romero, Juice, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Y\u00e9pez, Manuel Dagnino, Antonio Jos\u00e9 Urquinaona, Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n, Guillermo Quintero Luzardo, Eduardo Mathias Losada, Julio \u00c1rraga, Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez, families, as some of the best-known men and families in Venezuela and Latin America. In addition to El Cuadrado, another of the old cemeteries, now disappeared, was the cemetery of Santa Lucia, opened on January 30, 1881, and also closed in 1942. And it is not a new claim, the Panorama newspaper in its edition of January 7 In 2006, he published a report where the journalist Pa\u00fal Ram\u00edrez Mora said that 40 antisocials were living there and that more than 96,000 souls rested on 800 square meters in El Cuadrado. The Luxburg-Carolath Square cemetery is made up of four cemeteries, which are the colonial cemetery, the English cemetery, the Saint Lucia cemetery and The Square Luxburg-Carolath itself. Which makes it unique in Venezuela and Latin America.\n\nThe cemetery The Square Luxburg-Carolath, when it was built, was 200 x 200 meters. It was built in a classic style (classicism), due to the influence of the European colony in Maracaibo. The cemetery is the most famous, and oldest operational cemetery in Zulia and Venezuela, the most historical, not only because of its architecture but also because of the vast majority of the personalities that formed the splendor Maracaibo, Zulia and Venezuela that rest in peace there. Fine marble monuments brought from Italy each piece with spectacular details. Unique exquisite works composed of all known Architectural styles. The terrible \u201cSpanish flu\u201d or \u201cel trancazo\u201d, which in 1918 ended, according to data from the time with 800-1000 maracaiberos (citizens of Maracaibo), which represented in a population of about 36,000 souls, a mortality rate, from the flu, near 3%, similar to the world death rate. This was that of every 100 marabinos 50 were sick and about 3 died from the flu. It is understood because it prevented the procession of the Virgen de la Chiquinquir\u00e1 from leaving the old Saladillo neighborhood miraculously. \"Many souls received The Square in that epidemic.\" Actually, El Cuadrado is not just a historical treasure of Zulia or Maracaibo because of its architecture, it is mainly the only historical cemetery that houses 3 cemeteries in it and all possible major world religions. Catholics, Jews, Protestants and who knows who else. It is something unique in Venezuela.\n\nThe cemetery has about 1000 tombs which hold 10,364 dead people among whose graves, niches and pantheons have been buried in Zulian illustrious as the hero of independence Antonio Pulgar; the immortal rector of University of Zulia, Jes\u00fas Enrique Losada; the poet Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez; the doctor and scientist Humberto Fern\u00e1ndez Mor\u00e1n; the precursor of the national cinema Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n; the artist Julio \u00c1rraga; Dr. Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo; the creator of the university city, Antonio Borjas Romero; the magnate of the missing Bella Vista Castle, Lucas Evangelista Rinc\u00f3n; Don Manuel Belloso, founder of Cobeca and the \"saint\" Fray Junipero, whose body is said to remain intact in his coffin and becomes incredibly heavy if they try to move it. Isaiah chapter 14, verse 19 states: \"But you have been cast out of your sepulcher as a rejected rod.\" Today in the cemeteries, no grave enjoys privacy; the holy rest is interrupted amorally. Nowadays many times life is not respected and less death.\n\n== Description ==\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer counts that they have desecrated the great majority of the graves. \u201cThere is a depraved crime. There is no moral, nor respect for the deceased, for values, \u201dhe lamented. The buried body of a person takes 8 years to exhume and transfer the remains to the ossuary and the criminals opt for those that are more than 100 years old, that is, from 1920 onwards. Most are shattered. \u201cThe graves have very large marble vases, and they grab it to break the ossuaries. Mr. Ferrer estimated that of the 10 thousand three hundred people buried in El Cuadrado, and about 15 thousand dead in a unique separate vault called \u201cEl Carnero\u201d which is 50 meter deep, of which 40-50% is already abandoned, since \u201cthey have been lost because they are very old, or because relatives left them abandoned \"\n\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer, current worker of the El Cuadrado cemetery, his family has a long history related to the cemetery since the first worker Heriberto Hern\u00e1ndez for 45 years of service. He was the grandfather's father-in-law, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ferrer, of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer. Then came the grandfather who was 72 years in total. When the grandfather dies, Pope Nilo Enrique Ferrer Hern\u00e1ndez comes with 52 years of service, who died in 2011 and since that year Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer is the queeping with the tradition.\n\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer supervised and organized all the works in the cemetery by the Foundation Luxburg-Carolath to the cemetery. He was, with all his coworkers, the most important human factor in the entire organization since day one of all works. He and the history of his family related to all the time that the cemetery exists since its foundation is a separate story of Marabinos dedicated to their work of a family dynasty.\n\nSeveral tombs in the square have bars on top built by relatives who thought that would save them from thief and tomb raiders. They didn't help much. The bars were forced the desecrated tombs - the undergrowth emptied and they went into oblivion until the general cleaning. A common Venezuelan construction in our cemeteries that in our opinion have very few analogs in the world. By restoring cemeteries and putting all souls to rest in peace, we have in our opinion to leave as a memory to the time of tomb raiders and complete desolation. It didn't work, all the graves were perpetrated and stolen without any difference. Many activists and hired people worked during this work that seems simple at first but it was a difficult task because it is not a simple work yard it is a cemetery.\n\n== Characteristic of The Square Luxburg-Carolath Cemetery ==\nIn Maracaibo, the Colonial Cemetery (Old Cemetery or General Cemetery of Maracaibo) was opened in 1829, the Cemetery of the Germans opened 1834 and the Cemetery of Saint Lucia opened 1881. These cemeteries were sawn to perform civil works in the city in the year of 1942. The remains of the deceased who were left were transferred to the El Cuadrado cemetery simply because they were the closest to them. Columbariums were built in El Cuadrado to accommodate the deceased of the cemeteries. That is why the square cemetery is unique in Venezuela, it houses 3 other cemeteries since 1829, forming only one on 4, there are four cemeteries together in one. Like the city of Maracaibo. It is also called Athens of Latin America, the city of the 3 foundations. It is the most famous and ancient in Maracaibo and Zulia. The Columbariums today are in a total state of looting, deterioration, and perpetration. The reconstruction project of the cemetery carries the historical inclusion of the 3 cemeteries and their families.\n\n== Mixed Unique Architecture ==\nThe Square (El Cuadrado) is considered as an outstanding work of Funeral and Religious Art. The one that shows how Maracaibo el Zulia and Venezuela lived and developed. It is common to say that countries/governments and their level of civilization are judged by how they treat their deceased and their jailed citizens. The development of cemeteries the style of their graves is a unique contribution to the entity of any community in the world. It has almost all styles of architecture made such as Neoclassical, Classic, Naco (vulgar), Humble, Eclecticism, Gothic, Contemporary, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, with endless variations of their own given by family members. One of the few examples of different styles of architecture: Art Nouveau is represented by Fernandez Moran, Coronell Francisco Aguirre. Pantheon Electrico family Quintero designed by Hermes Romero (the same architect that designed The Square) Tomb of the Losada family inspired by the temple of classical antiquity and others that will be described separately. All known styles in one way or another are presented in the cemetery.\n\n== Owner and Administration ==\n'''The Grafen von Luxburg Family Foundation, F\u00fcrsten zu Carolath-Beuthen und Prinzen von Schoenaich-Carolath''' is a civil, charitable and non-profit foundation founded on June 14, 1940, by [[Karl von Luxburg]]; She is the owner and administrator of the Cemetery Luxburg-Carolath Square since August 2019.\n\n'''Karl Ludwig Graf von Luxburg, F\u00fcrst zu Carolath-Beuthen und Prinz von Schoenaich-Carolath, Minister and Ambassador of the German Empire during World War I.'''
