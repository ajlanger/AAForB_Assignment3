With the use of SMS and voice calls, group coordination is organized through singular calls/text messages to each individual group member. Although, one person can send the same text message to multiple group members, the group members can't see the responses of everyone else or even know who's in the group at all. Group members only have access to the messages they either send or receive, which hinders group coordination. With the introduction of messaging apps, users can form group chats, where all the members can see an entire thread of everyone's responses. Members can also respond directly to each other, rather than having to go through the member who started the group message, to relay the information. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ling |first1=Rich |last2=Lai |first2=Chih-Hui |title=Microcoordination 2.0: Social Coordination in the Age of Smartphones and Messaging Apps. |journal=Journal of Communication |date=October 6, 2016 |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=834\u2013856 |doi=10.1111/jcom.12251 }}</ref>\n\n==Features==\nMessaging apps each have some of the following features:\n\n* Chat\n** One-on-one chat\n** Group chat\n** Broadcast lists\n** [[Chatbots]] (including \"bot in group chats\")\n** \"Smart replies\" (suggested replies to incoming messages provided by Google's Reply platform )<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ausdroid.net/2018/02/22/googles-new-reply-app-makes-appearance-link-install-inside/|title=Google's new Reply app makes an appearance, link to install inside - Ausdroid|website=ausdroid.net|date=2018-02-22}}</ref>\n* Calls\n** Voice calls\n** Video calls\n* Audio alerts (on Line)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/05/07/economist-talks-advantages-line-over-whatsapp-mobile-messaging-push|title=The Economist talks on advantages of Line over Whatsapp for mobile messaging push|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[File sharing]]\n* Games\n* \"Mini Programs\" (e.g. WeChat Mini Program)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://open.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=overseas_open/docs/mini-programs/development/brief-tutorial|title=Brief Tutorial - WeChat Open Platform|website=open.wechat.com}}</ref>\n* News discovery (e.g. Snapchat Discover)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digiday.com/media/snap-tries-to-make-tv-and-magazines-coexist-on-snapchat-discover/|title=Does Snapchat Discover want to be TV or magazines?
