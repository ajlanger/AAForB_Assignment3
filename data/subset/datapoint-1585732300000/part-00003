His son [[Mario Van Peebles]] also appears in a small role, playing the title character as a young boy. It tells the [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]] story of the flight of a poor black man from the [[White American|white]] police authorities.\n\nVan Peebles began to develop the film after being offered a three-picture contract for [[Columbia Pictures]]. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded it himself, shooting it independently over 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several sex scenes, some reportedly [[unsimulated sex|unsimulated]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=J.|title=Videodrome: Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song (1971)|url=http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2014/01/29/videodrome-sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971/|website=Aquarium Drunkard|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref> He received a $50,000 loan from [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the project. The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. The picture was censored in some markets, and received mixed reviews. However, it has left a lasting impression on African-American cinema.\n\nThe musical score of ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' was performed by [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. Van Peebles did not have money for traditional advertising methods, so released the [[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] prior to the film's release in order to generate publicity. Initially, the film was screened in only two theaters in the United States. It went on to gross $15.2 million at the box office. [[Huey P. Newton]] celebrated and welcomed the film's revolutionary implications, and ''Sweetback'' became required viewing for members of the [[Black Panther Party]]. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', it demonstrated to [[Hollywood film industry|Hollywood]] that films which portrayed \"militant\" blacks could be highly profitable, leading to the creation of the [[blaxploitation]] genre,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jutton |first1=Lee |title=SWEET SWEETBACK\u2019S BAADASSSSS SONG: A Blaxploitation Classic That Remains All Too Relevant Today |url=https://www.filminquiry.com/sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971-review/ |website=www.filminquiry.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref> although critic [[Roger Ebert]], commenting on a review of the 2004 film about the making of this movie, did not consider this example of Van Peebles' work to be an [[exploitation film]].<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040611/REVIEWS/406110302 |title=Review of ''Baadasssss!'' |accessdate=2007-01-04 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=June 11, 2004 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA young African-American orphan ([[Mario Van Peebles]]) is given shelter by the proprietor of a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] brothel in the 1940s. While working there as a young towel boy, he is raped by one of the [[Prostitution|prostitutes]]. The women name him \"Sweet Sweetback\" in honor of his sexual prowess and large penis. As an adult, Sweetback works in the whorehouse by performing in a [[sex show]].\n\nOne night, two white [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers come in to speak to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community to bring in a suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback in order to appease their superiors, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers also arrest a young [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback fashions his handcuffs into a pair of [[brass knuckles]] and beats the officers, putting them into comas.\n\nSweetback returns to the whorehouse for help, but Beetle refuses out of fear of being arrested himself. As Sweetback leaves, he is arrested and beaten by the police on the orders of the police commissioner, seeking information about Mu-Mu's whereabouts, but escapes when a black revolutionary throws a [[molotov cocktail]] at the police car transporting him to the station. He next visits an old girlfriend (Rhetta Hughes), who similarly refuses him aid but agrees to cut his handcuffs off in exchange for sex. Sweetback then asks for help from his [[priest]], but he, too, refuses for fear of the police shutting down the [[drug rehab]] center he runs out of the church's attic.\n\nTwo police officers threaten Beetle in an attempt to discover Sweetback's whereabouts, rendering him deaf by firing a gun next to each ear. Sweetback meets up with Mu-Mu and black gangsters drive them through [[South Central Los Angeles]] to the city outskirts, in the direction of the [[United States\u2013Mexico border]]. Stopping for the night at a seemingly abandoned building, they discover that it is a [[safe house]] for a chapter of the [[Hells Angels]]. Their helmetted president challenges Sweetback to a duel: asked to decide the weapon and discovering she is a woman, he chooses sex and is judged to have won. Afterwards, the bikers leave the men in their club to await a member of the all black [[East Bay Dragons MC|East Bay Dragons]] who will get them to Mexico. In the middle of the night, the club is raided by two policemen with drawn guns. Sweetback resists arrest and kills both officers in self-defense, but Mu-Mu is badly wounded. The next morning, the Dragon ([[John Amos]]) arrives, but only has room on his motorcycle for one passenger; Sweetback asks him to take Mu-Mu instead of him, as the activist Mu-Mu is their future.\n\nAs Sweetback and Mu-Mu continues to evade arrest, public pressure mounts on the police; the police commissioner warns his staff that failure to catch them could result in an uprising. The police badly beat up a black man sleeping with a white woman, believing him to be one of the fugitives. Later, Beetle, now in a wheelchair, is brought to the morgue to identify a body believed to be Sweetback and smiles when he sees it is somone else.\n\nSweetback pays a [[hippie]] to switch clothes with him, deceiving the police who then send a helicopter in pursuit of the hippie through the desert. The police find Sweetback's biological mother, who reveals that his birth name is Leroy. As Sweetback approaches the border, the police become desperate, and force a farmer to lend them his hunting dogs. The chase concludes in the [[Tijuana River]], where Sweetback kills two of the dogs and escapes into Mexico, swearing to return to \"collect some dues\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Sweetback\n* Hubert Scales as Mu-Mu\n* Simon Chuckster as Beetle\n* John Dullaghan as Commissioner\n* West Gale\n* Niva Rochelle\n* [[Rhetta Hughes]] as Old Girl Friend\n* Nick Ferrari\n* Ed Rue\n* [[John Amos]] as Biker (as Johnny Amos)\n* Lavelle Roby\n* Ted Hayden\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as Young Sweetback / Kid (as Mario Peebles)\n{{Colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\nDuring production on ''[[Watermelon Man (film)|Watermelon Man]]'' for [[Columbia Pictures]], Van Peebles attempted to rewrite the script in order to change it from a comedy poking fun of white liberals into the first [[black power]] film. The writer, [[Herman Raucher]], who had based the script on friends of his who expressed liberal sentiments while still holding onto bigoted beliefs, objected to Van Peebles' efforts because he felt that the movie should be a parody of liberal culture.<ref>[http://www.cinedump.com/interviews/2016/9/13/hermanraucher Fassel, Preston. ''Rediscovering Herman Raucher.'' Retrieved 10 February 2017]</ref> Raucher ultimately exercised a clause in his contract that allowed him to novelize his own script, effectively preventing Peebles from too radically changing the film.\n\nAfter ''Watermelon Man'' proved to be a financial success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles- still wanting to create the first black power film- developed the story for ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song''. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the [[Mojave desert]], turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. He parked the car, got out, and squatted down facing the sun.  He decided that the film was going to be \"about a brother getting [[the Man]]'s foot out of his ass.\"<ref name=\"DariusJames\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Darius |authorlink=Darius James |coauthors= |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-312-13192-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"DVD\">Van Peebles, Melvin.

Van Peebles was given a $50,000 loan by [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the film. \"Cosby didn't want an equity part,\" according to Van Peebles. \"He just wanted his money back.\" Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film. Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they wouldn't do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nAccording to Van Peebles, during the first day of shooting, director of photography and head cameraman Bob Maxwell told him he could not mix two different shades of mechanical film lights, because he believed the results would not appear well on film. Van Peebles told him to do it anyway. When he saw the [[Dailies|rushes]], Maxwell was overjoyed, and Van Peebles did not encounter that issue again during the shoot. Van Peebles shot the film over a relatively short period of 19 days in order to reduce the possibility of the cast, most of whom were amateurs, showing on some days with haircuts or clothes different from the prior day. He shot the film in what he referred to as \"globs,\" where he would shoot entire sequences at a time. Because Van Peebles couldn't afford a [[Stunt performer|stunt man]], he performed all of the stunts himself, which also included appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes. At one point in the shoot, Van Peebles was forced to jump off a bridge. Bob Maxwell later stated, \"Well, that's great, Mel, but let's do it again.\" Van Peebles ended up performing the stunt nine times. Van Peebles contracted [[gonorrhea]] when filming one of the many sex scenes, and successfully applied to the [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild]] in order to get [[workers' compensation]] because he was \"hurt on the job.\" Van Peebles used the money to purchase more film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/><ref>[http://whatculture.com/film/17-sex-scenes-that-supposedly-werent-simulated?page=2 What Culture#17]; Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</ref>\n\nVan Peebles and several key crew members were armed because it was dangerous to attempt to create a film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to stay until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crew members were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nVan Peebles had received a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, there was no time to have it filed before shooting the scene. When the scene was shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Directing===\nVan Peebles stated that he approached directing the film \"like you do the cupboard when you're broke and hungry: throw in everything eatable and hope to come out on top with the seasoning, i.e., by editing.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" /> Van Peebles stated that \"story-wise, I came up with an idea, why not the direct approach. ... To avoid putting myself into a corner and writing something I wouldn't be able to shoot, I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to take those givens and juggle them into the final scenario.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\">{{cite book |last=Van Peebles |first=Melvin |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Kaufman, Alan |editor2=Ortenberg, Neil |editor3=Rosset, Barney |others= |title=The Outlaw Bible of American Literature |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2004 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-56025-550-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 286\u2013289] |chapter=''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles wanted \"a victorious film ... where [[nigger]]s could walk out standing tall instead of avoiding each other's eyes, looking once again like they'd had it.\" Van Peebles was aware of the fact that films produced by major studios would appear to be more polished than low-budget independently made features, and was determined to make a film that \"[looked] as good as anything one of the major studios could turn out.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles knew that in order to spread his message, the film \"simply couldn't be a didactic discourse which would end up playing ... to an empty theater except for ten or twenty aware brothers who would pat me on the back and say it tells it like it is\" and that \"to attract the mass we have to produce work that not only instructs but entertains\". Van Peebles also wanted to make a film that would \"be able to sustain itself as a viable commercial product ... [The Man] ain't about to go carrying no messages for you, especially a relevant one, for free.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles wanted half of his shooting crew \"to be third world people. ... So at best a staggering amount of my crew would be relatively inexperienced. ... Any type of film requiring an enormous technical sophistication at the shooting stage should not be attempted.\" Van Peebles knew that gaining financing for the film would not be easy and expected \"a great deal of animosity from the film media (white in the first place and right wing in the second) at all levels of filmmaking\", thus he had to \"write a flexible script where emphasis could be shifted. In short, stay loose.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\n===Editing===\nThe film's fast-paced [[Montage sequence|montage]]s and [[jump cut]]s were novel features for an American movie at the time. Stephen Holden from ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the film's editing had \"a jazzy, improvisational quality, and the screen is often streaked with jarring psychedelic effects that illustrate Sweetback's alienation.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|title=FILM VIEW; Sweet Sweetback's World Revisited\n|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=July 2, 1995|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/02/movies/film-view-sweet-sweetback-s-world-revisited.html|accessdate=January 11, 2012|first=Stephen|last=Holden}}</ref> In ''The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity'', author S.

Because he did not know how to read or write music, he numbered all of the keys on a piano so he could remember the melodies.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> Van Peebles stated that \"Most filmmakers look at a feature in terms of image and story or vice versa. Effects and music [...] are strictly secondary considerations. Very few look at film with sound considered as a creative third dimension. So I calculate the scenario in such a way that sound can be used as an integral part of the film.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nThe film's music was performed by the then-unknown group [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], who were living in a single apartment with hardly any food at the time. Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> By alternating [[hymn]]-based vocalization and [[jazz]] rhythms, Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in [[hip hop music]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Kermit Ernest |title=Gettin' our groove on: rhetoric, language, and literacy for the hip hop generation |year=2005 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0-8143-2925-2 |page=43 |chapter=Professing the Power of the Rap }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles recalls that \"music was not used as a selling tool in movies at the time. Even musicals, it would take three months after the release of the movie before they would bring out an album.\" Because Van Peebles did not have any money for traditional advertising methods, he decided that by releasing a [[soundtrack album]] in anticipation of the film's release, he could help build awareness for the film with its music.<ref name=\"Funk\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Funk |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2001 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-87930-629-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 207\u2013208] |chapter=Blaxploitation: Funk Goes to the Movies |chapterurl= |quote= |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n==Release and alterations==\nThe film was released on April 23, 1971. Melvin Van Peebles stated that \"at first, only two theaters in the United States would show the picture: one in [[Detroit]], and one in [[Atlanta]]. The first night in Detroit, it broke all the theater's records, and that was only on the strength of the title alone, since nobody had seen it yet.

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] cited the ending as a reason for the film not to be labeled as an [[exploitation film]].<ref name=\"Ebert\"/>\n\nThe ''New York Times'' critic Clayton Riley viewed the film favorably, commenting on its aesthetic innovation, but stated of the character of Sweetback that he \"is the ultimate sexualist in whose seemingly vacant eyes and unrevealing mouth are written the protocols of American domestic [[colonialism]].\" In another review, Riley explained that \"Sweetback, the profane sexual athlete and fugitive, is based on a reality that is Black. We may not want him to exist but he does.\" Critic [[Donald Bogle]] states in a ''New York Times'' interview that the film in some ways met the black audience's compensatory needs after years of asexual, [[Sidney Poitier]]-type characters and that they wanted a \"viable, sexual, assertive, arrogant black male hero.\"<ref name=\"FramingBlackness\" /> In a compendium about the Museum of Modern Art's film and media collection, curator Steven Higgins describes the film's place in history: \"Not since [[Oscar Micheaux]] had an African-American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment...[it] depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other.\"<ref name=\"moma\">Higgins, Steven.

Warts and all, the film is perhaps the closest analogy to the progressive aims of the then-flourishing Black Arts movement. Indeed, it can be argued that because it was written, produced and directed by an American-born African outside of Hollywood, the film is not truly part of the blaxploitation genre, yet it cannot be denied that it shares certain thematic similarities. The film works best when it follows Sweetback's odyssey from stud boy to proto-nationalist consciousness. Unlike the Horatio Alger-style integrationism propagated in past films about blacks, here we see an outlaw among outlaws, nourished by a community segregated from the mainstream. It is in this disenfranchised community--and not the sterile offices of the NAACP--that he seeks and finds refuge. The sordid sexual trysts, the faux fantasies in the desert are, finally, less interesting than Sweetback's quest for self-realization.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baxter |first1=Nicky |title=In the early '70s, blaxploitation upended Hollywood stereotypes |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.09.95/blax-9545.html |website=www.metroactive.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Notable reactions===\n[[Huey P.

Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that \"some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes.\" Bennett concluded that the film is \"neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation.\" Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the \"rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute.\" Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as \"emancipation orgasms\" and stated that \"it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 that they are going to be able to screw their way across the Red Sea. Fucking will not set you free.

His son [[Mario Van Peebles]] also appears in a small role, playing the title character as a young boy. It tells the [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]] story of the flight of a poor black man from the [[White American|white]] police authorities.\n\nVan Peebles began to develop the film after being offered a three-picture contract for [[Columbia Pictures]]. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded it himself, shooting it independently over 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several sex scenes, some reportedly [[unsimulated sex|unsimulated]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=J.|title=Videodrome: Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song (1971)|url=http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2014/01/29/videodrome-sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971/|website=Aquarium Drunkard|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref> He received a $50,000 loan from [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the project. The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. The picture was censored in some markets, and received mixed reviews. However, it has left a lasting impression on African-American cinema.\n\nThe musical score of ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' was performed by [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. Van Peebles did not have money for traditional advertising methods, so released the [[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] prior to the film's release in order to generate publicity. Initially, the film was screened in only two theaters in the United States. It went on to gross $15.2 million at the box office. [[Huey P. Newton]] celebrated and welcomed the film's revolutionary implications, and ''Sweetback'' became required viewing for members of the [[Black Panther Party]]. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', it demonstrated to [[Hollywood film industry|Hollywood]] that films which portrayed \"militant\" blacks could be highly profitable, leading to the creation of the [[blaxploitation]] genre,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jutton |first1=Lee |title=SWEET SWEETBACK\u2019S BAADASSSSS SONG: A Blaxploitation Classic That Remains All Too Relevant Today |url=https://www.filminquiry.com/sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971-review/ |website=www.filminquiry.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref> although critic [[Roger Ebert]], commenting on a review of the 2004 film about the making of this movie, did not consider this example of Van Peebles' work to be an [[exploitation film]].<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040611/REVIEWS/406110302 |title=Review of ''Baadasssss!'' |accessdate=2007-01-04 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=June 11, 2004 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA young African-American orphan ([[Mario Van Peebles]]) is given shelter by the proprietor of a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] brothel in the 1940s. While working there as a young towel boy, he is raped by one of the [[Prostitution|prostitutes]]. The women name him \"Sweet Sweetback\" in honor of his sexual prowess and large penis. As an adult, Sweetback works in the whorehouse by performing in a [[sex show]].\n\nOne night, two white [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers come in to speak to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community to bring in a suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback in order to appease their superiors, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers also arrest a young [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback fashions his handcuffs into a pair of [[brass knuckles]] and beats the officers, putting them into comas.\n\nSweetback returns to the whorehouse for help, but Beetle refuses out of fear of being arrested himself. As Sweetback leaves, he is arrested and beaten by the police on the orders of the police commissioner, seeking information about Mu-Mu's whereabouts, but escapes when a black revolutionary throws a [[molotov cocktail]] at the police car transporting him to the station. He next visits an old girlfriend (Rhetta Hughes), who similarly refuses him aid but agrees to cut his handcuffs off in exchange for sex. Sweetback then asks for help from his [[priest]], but he, too, refuses for fear of the police shutting down the [[drug rehab]] center he runs out of the church's attic.\n\nTwo police officers threaten Beetle in an attempt to discover Sweetback's whereabouts, rendering him deaf by firing a gun next to each ear. Sweetback meets up with Mu-Mu and black gangsters drive them through [[South Central Los Angeles]] to the city outskirts, in the direction of the [[United States\u2013Mexico border]]. Stopping for the night at a seemingly abandoned building, they discover that it is a [[safe house]] for a chapter of the [[Hells Angels]]. Their helmetted president challenges Sweetback to a duel: asked to decide the weapon and discovering she is a woman, he chooses sex and is judged to have won. Afterwards, the bikers leave the men in their club to await a member of the all black [[East Bay Dragons MC|East Bay Dragons]] who will get them to Mexico. In the middle of the night, the club is raided by two policemen with drawn guns. Sweetback resists arrest and kills both officers in self-defense, but Mu-Mu is badly wounded. The next morning, the Dragon ([[John Amos]]) arrives, but only has room on his motorcycle for one passenger; Sweetback asks him to take Mu-Mu instead of him, as the activist Mu-Mu is their future.\n\nAs Sweetback and Mu-Mu continues to evade arrest, public pressure mounts on the police; the police commissioner warns his staff that failure to catch them could result in an uprising. The police badly beat up a black man sleeping with a white woman, believing him to be one of the fugitives. Later, Beetle, now in a wheelchair, is brought to the morgue to identify a body believed to be Sweetback; he mocks the officers when it turns out to be someone else.\n\nSweetback pays a [[hippie]] to switch clothes with him, deceiving the police who then send a helicopter in pursuit of the hippie through the desert. The police find Sweetback's biological mother, who reveals that his birth name is Leroy. As Sweetback approaches the border, the police become desperate, and force a farmer to lend them his hunting dogs. The chase concludes in the [[Tijuana River]], where Sweetback kills two of the dogs and escapes into Mexico, swearing to return to \"collect some dues\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Sweetback\n* Hubert Scales as Mu-Mu\n* Simon Chuckster as Beetle\n* John Dullaghan as Commissioner\n* West Gale\n* Niva Rochelle\n* [[Rhetta Hughes]] as Old Girl Friend\n* Nick Ferrari\n* Ed Rue\n* [[John Amos]] as Biker (as Johnny Amos)\n* Lavelle Roby\n* Ted Hayden\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as Young Sweetback / Kid (as Mario Peebles)\n{{Colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\nDuring production on ''[[Watermelon Man (film)|Watermelon Man]]'' for [[Columbia Pictures]], Van Peebles attempted to rewrite the script in order to change it from a comedy poking fun of white liberals into the first [[black power]] film. The writer, [[Herman Raucher]], who had based the script on friends of his who expressed liberal sentiments while still holding onto bigoted beliefs, objected to Van Peebles' efforts because he felt that the movie should be a parody of liberal culture.<ref>[http://www.cinedump.com/interviews/2016/9/13/hermanraucher Fassel, Preston. ''Rediscovering Herman Raucher.'' Retrieved 10 February 2017]</ref> Raucher ultimately exercised a clause in his contract that allowed him to novelize his own script, effectively preventing Peebles from too radically changing the film.\n\nAfter ''Watermelon Man'' proved to be a financial success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles- still wanting to create the first black power film- developed the story for ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song''. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the [[Mojave desert]], turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. He parked the car, got out, and squatted down facing the sun.  He decided that the film was going to be \"about a brother getting [[the Man]]'s foot out of his ass.\"<ref name=\"DariusJames\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Darius |authorlink=Darius James |coauthors= |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-312-13192-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"DVD\">Van Peebles, Melvin.

Van Peebles was given a $50,000 loan by [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the film. \"Cosby didn't want an equity part,\" according to Van Peebles. \"He just wanted his money back.\" Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film. Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they wouldn't do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nAccording to Van Peebles, during the first day of shooting, director of photography and head cameraman Bob Maxwell told him he could not mix two different shades of mechanical film lights, because he believed the results would not appear well on film. Van Peebles told him to do it anyway. When he saw the [[Dailies|rushes]], Maxwell was overjoyed, and Van Peebles did not encounter that issue again during the shoot. Van Peebles shot the film over a relatively short period of 19 days in order to reduce the possibility of the cast, most of whom were amateurs, showing on some days with haircuts or clothes different from the prior day. He shot the film in what he referred to as \"globs,\" where he would shoot entire sequences at a time. Because Van Peebles couldn't afford a [[Stunt performer|stunt man]], he performed all of the stunts himself, which also included appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes. At one point in the shoot, Van Peebles was forced to jump off a bridge. Bob Maxwell later stated, \"Well, that's great, Mel, but let's do it again.\" Van Peebles ended up performing the stunt nine times. Van Peebles contracted [[gonorrhea]] when filming one of the many sex scenes, and successfully applied to the [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild]] in order to get [[workers' compensation]] because he was \"hurt on the job.\" Van Peebles used the money to purchase more film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/><ref>[http://whatculture.com/film/17-sex-scenes-that-supposedly-werent-simulated?page=2 What Culture#17]; Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</ref>\n\nVan Peebles and several key crew members were armed because it was dangerous to attempt to create a film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to stay until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crew members were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nVan Peebles had received a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, there was no time to have it filed before shooting the scene. When the scene was shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Directing===\nVan Peebles stated that he approached directing the film \"like you do the cupboard when you're broke and hungry: throw in everything eatable and hope to come out on top with the seasoning, i.e., by editing.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" /> Van Peebles stated that \"story-wise, I came up with an idea, why not the direct approach. ... To avoid putting myself into a corner and writing something I wouldn't be able to shoot, I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to take those givens and juggle them into the final scenario.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\">{{cite book |last=Van Peebles |first=Melvin |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Kaufman, Alan |editor2=Ortenberg, Neil |editor3=Rosset, Barney |others= |title=The Outlaw Bible of American Literature |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2004 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-56025-550-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 286\u2013289] |chapter=''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles wanted \"a victorious film ... where [[nigger]]s could walk out standing tall instead of avoiding each other's eyes, looking once again like they'd had it.\" Van Peebles was aware of the fact that films produced by major studios would appear to be more polished than low-budget independently made features, and was determined to make a film that \"[looked] as good as anything one of the major studios could turn out.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles knew that in order to spread his message, the film \"simply couldn't be a didactic discourse which would end up playing ... to an empty theater except for ten or twenty aware brothers who would pat me on the back and say it tells it like it is\" and that \"to attract the mass we have to produce work that not only instructs but entertains\". Van Peebles also wanted to make a film that would \"be able to sustain itself as a viable commercial product ... [The Man] ain't about to go carrying no messages for you, especially a relevant one, for free.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles wanted half of his shooting crew \"to be third world people. ... So at best a staggering amount of my crew would be relatively inexperienced. ... Any type of film requiring an enormous technical sophistication at the shooting stage should not be attempted.\" Van Peebles knew that gaining financing for the film would not be easy and expected \"a great deal of animosity from the film media (white in the first place and right wing in the second) at all levels of filmmaking\", thus he had to \"write a flexible script where emphasis could be shifted. In short, stay loose.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\n===Editing===\nThe film's fast-paced [[Montage sequence|montage]]s and [[jump cut]]s were novel features for an American movie at the time. Stephen Holden from ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the film's editing had \"a jazzy, improvisational quality, and the screen is often streaked with jarring psychedelic effects that illustrate Sweetback's alienation.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|title=FILM VIEW; Sweet Sweetback's World Revisited\n|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=July 2, 1995|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/02/movies/film-view-sweet-sweetback-s-world-revisited.html|accessdate=January 11, 2012|first=Stephen|last=Holden}}</ref> In ''The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity'', author S.

Because he did not know how to read or write music, he numbered all of the keys on a piano so he could remember the melodies.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> Van Peebles stated that \"Most filmmakers look at a feature in terms of image and story or vice versa. Effects and music [...] are strictly secondary considerations. Very few look at film with sound considered as a creative third dimension. So I calculate the scenario in such a way that sound can be used as an integral part of the film.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nThe film's music was performed by the then-unknown group [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], who were living in a single apartment with hardly any food at the time. Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> By alternating [[hymn]]-based vocalization and [[jazz]] rhythms, Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in [[hip hop music]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Kermit Ernest |title=Gettin' our groove on: rhetoric, language, and literacy for the hip hop generation |year=2005 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0-8143-2925-2 |page=43 |chapter=Professing the Power of the Rap }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles recalls that \"music was not used as a selling tool in movies at the time. Even musicals, it would take three months after the release of the movie before they would bring out an album.\" Because Van Peebles did not have any money for traditional advertising methods, he decided that by releasing a [[soundtrack album]] in anticipation of the film's release, he could help build awareness for the film with its music.<ref name=\"Funk\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Funk |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2001 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-87930-629-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 207\u2013208] |chapter=Blaxploitation: Funk Goes to the Movies |chapterurl= |quote= |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n==Release and alterations==\nThe film was released on April 23, 1971. Melvin Van Peebles stated that \"at first, only two theaters in the United States would show the picture: one in [[Detroit]], and one in [[Atlanta]].

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] cited the ending as a reason for the film not to be labeled as an [[exploitation film]].<ref name=\"Ebert\"/>\n\nThe ''New York Times'' critic Clayton Riley viewed the film favorably, commenting on its aesthetic innovation, but stated of the character of Sweetback that he \"is the ultimate sexualist in whose seemingly vacant eyes and unrevealing mouth are written the protocols of American domestic [[colonialism]].\" In another review, Riley explained that \"Sweetback, the profane sexual athlete and fugitive, is based on a reality that is Black. We may not want him to exist but he does.\" Critic [[Donald Bogle]] states in a ''New York Times'' interview that the film in some ways met the black audience's compensatory needs after years of asexual, [[Sidney Poitier]]-type characters and that they wanted a \"viable, sexual, assertive, arrogant black male hero.\"<ref name=\"FramingBlackness\" /> In a compendium about the Museum of Modern Art's film and media collection, curator Steven Higgins describes the film's place in history: \"Not since [[Oscar Micheaux]] had an African-American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment...[it] depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other.\"<ref name=\"moma\">Higgins, Steven.

Warts and all, the film is perhaps the closest analogy to the progressive aims of the then-flourishing Black Arts movement. Indeed, it can be argued that because it was written, produced and directed by an American-born African outside of Hollywood, the film is not truly part of the blaxploitation genre, yet it cannot be denied that it shares certain thematic similarities. The film works best when it follows Sweetback's odyssey from stud boy to proto-nationalist consciousness. Unlike the Horatio Alger-style integrationism propagated in past films about blacks, here we see an outlaw among outlaws, nourished by a community segregated from the mainstream. It is in this disenfranchised community--and not the sterile offices of the NAACP--that he seeks and finds refuge. The sordid sexual trysts, the faux fantasies in the desert are, finally, less interesting than Sweetback's quest for self-realization.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baxter |first1=Nicky |title=In the early '70s, blaxploitation upended Hollywood stereotypes |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.09.95/blax-9545.html |website=www.metroactive.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Notable reactions===\n[[Huey P.

Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that \"some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes.\" Bennett concluded that the film is \"neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation.\" Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the \"rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute.\" Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as \"emancipation orgasms\" and stated that \"it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 that they are going to be able to screw their way across the Red Sea. Fucking will not set you free.
