In October the same year, the group headquarters (HQ) was moved to [[St Vincents Hall]] in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]]. During the Second World War, 5 Group was concentrated primarily in south Lincolnshire (whereas 1 Group was more concentrated in the north of the county).<ref>{{Harvnb|Otter|1996|p=15.}}</ref> Most of the 5 Group airfields were around Lincoln, including [[RAF Scampton]].\n\nBy the end of the Second World War, the Group had grown to 15 squadrons. During the war, it included a significant proportion of [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (or Australian-born RAF) personnel, both aircrews and ground staff, who were concentrated in three \"[[Article XV squadrons]]\": [[No. 455 Squadron RAAF]],<ref> In April 1942, 455 Sqn RAAF was transferred from 5 Group (Bomber Command) to 18 Group, Coastal Command.</ref> [[No. 463 Squadron RAAF]] and [[No. 467 Squadron RAAF]]. The Group also famously included an elite, multi-national unit: [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|No. 617 Squadron]], perhaps better known as \"[[Operation Chastise|The Dambusters]]\". 617 Sqn was formed in March 1943, and comprised RAF, RAAF, [[RCAF]]/Canadian and RNZAF/New Zealand aircrew personnel, who had been hand-picked from squadrons throughout Bomber Command.\n\n5 Group became noted for the development of innovative techniques and technology, as well as accuracy.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Techniques developed by the group included the \"corkscrew\" manouevre,{{cn|date=February 2020}} that was used by heavy bombers to evade enemy fighters, and the \"quick landing system\" {{vague|date=February 2020}}. Led by 617 Squadron, the Group often engaged in special missions, using new weapons, such as [[Sir Barnes Wallis|Barnes Wallis]]'s [[bouncing bomb]]s, and two type of \"earthquake bomb\": [[Tallboy bomb|Tallboy]] and [[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam]].\n\n'''1939 \u2013 1945'''\n\nFrom 11 September 1939 until 22 November 1940, [[Air Vice Marshal]] (AVM) [[Arthur Travers Harris|Arthur Harris]] was in charge. The group started the war with 10 squadrons,  all equipped with the [[Handley Page Hampden]]. The Group continued to fly only Hampdens until the northern winter of 1940\u20131941 when it began to convert to the new [[Avro Manchester]].\n\nEarly in 1942, the Manchester, was replaced by its four-engined variant: the [[Avro Lancaster]], started to equip the group squadrons. On 17 October 1942, under [[Operation Robinson]], some 86 Lancasters from 5 Group (without fighter escort) flew deep into occupied France to attack the Schneider armaments works at [[Le Creusot]] and the associated electrical station at [[Montchanin]]. On the night of 22\u201323 October, 85 Lancasters of the Group attacked [[Genoa]] without a single loss. On 24 October, 74 Lancasters delivered a daylight attack on [[Milan]].\n\nIn May 1943, 617 Squadron breached two of the [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr]] dams during the famous \"Dams Raid\": [[Operation Chastise]].\n\nAVM [[Ralph Cochrane]], who was to become influential in terms of Bomber Command tactics, took command of 5 Group in October 1943. Group HQ was moved to Morton Hall, at [[RAF Swinderby]] in November 1943,\n\nUsing the [[Stabilizing Automatic Bomb Sight]] (SABS) and the {{convert|12000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Tallboy, 617 Sqn achieved a bombing error of only {{convert|94|yd|m|abbr=on}} at the [[Vergeltungswaffe|V Weapon]] launch site at [[Abbeville]], during December 1943.\n\nDuring the lead-up to [[D-day]], Cochrane was an advocate of low-level marking, to improve accuracy, and lobbied heavily to be allowed to prove the principle operationally. New systems of target-marking were developed as result and were tested by 617 Squadron \u2013 especially its commanding officer, Wing Commander [[Leonard Cheshire]], using the [[de Havilland Mosquito]] and [[North American Mustang]]. (Cheshire was subsequently awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] and taken off active operations.) Cochrane thereby demonstrated that 5 Group could hit targets and techniques that [[No. 8 Group RAF|8 (Pathfinder) Group]] would not attempt.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe special missions included [[List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz|attacks on the German battleship ''Tirpitz'']] in late 1944 and the use of the Grand Slam against the strategically-important [[Bielefeld]] railway viaduct, in March 1945.\n\n5 Group was disbanded on 15 December 1945.\n\n==Notable raids==\n* First \"thousand-bomber attack\" on [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Cologne]] on 30 May 1942 (shared)\n* [[Operation Chastise|\"Dambuster\" attack]] on the dams at the [[M\u00f6hne Reservoir]], the [[Edersee]] and [[Sorpe Dam|Sorpedam]] on 17 May 1943 (without backup)\n* [[Bombing of Braunschweig in World War II|Attack on Braunschweig]], 15 October 1944 (without backup)\n* Attack on [[Heilbronn]], 4 December 1944 (without backup)\n* Attack on [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden]] on 13 February 1945 (without backup on the first attack)\n* [[Grand Slam bomb|Grand Slam attack]] on [[Hamm\u2013Minden railway#Schildesche viaduct|Schildesche viaduct]] near Bielefeld on 14 March 1945 (without backup)\n* Attack on [[Bombing of W\u00fcrzburg in World War II|W\u00fcrzburg, 16 March 1945]] (shared)\n* Attack on the oil refinery at [[T\u00f8nsberg]] in Southern [[Norway]], the last raid by heavy bombers of Bomber Command in World War II.\n\n==Commanders==\n'''1918 to 1919'''\n* 1 April 1918 [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Frederick Halahan]]\n* May 1918 [[Brigadier-General]] [[Charles Laverock Lambe]]\n\n'''1937 to 1945'''\n* 17 August 1937 [[Air Commodore]] [[William Bertram Callaway]]\n* 11 September 1939 [[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Arthur Travers Harris]]\n* 22 November 1940 Air Vice-Marshal [[Norman Bottomley]]\n* 12 May 1941 Air Vice-Marshal [[John Slessor]]\n* 25 April 1942 Air Vice-Marshal [[Alec Coryton]]\n* 28 February 1943 Air Vice-Marshal [[Ralph Cochrane]]\n* 16 January 1945 Air Vice-Marshal [[Hugh Constantine]]<ref>{{harvnb|Moyes|1976|p=343.}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Royal Air Force groups]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Moyes |first=Philip J.
