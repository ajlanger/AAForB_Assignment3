The southern and central parts of the Gobi Desert have variable plant growth due to this [[monsoon]] activity.

It extends from the [[Inner Mongolia]]n [[Plateau]] in China northward into Mongolia. It includes the [[Yin Mountains]] and many low-lying areas with salt pans and small ponds. It is bounded by the [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland]] to the north, the Yellow River Plain to the southeast, and the Alashan Plateau semi-desert to the southeast and east.\n* '''Alashan Plateau semi-desert''', lies west and southwest of the Eastern Gobi desert steppe. It consists of the desert basins and low mountains lying between the Gobi Altai range on the north, the [[Helan Mountains]] to the southeast, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and northeastern portion of the Tibetan Plateau on the southwest.\n* '''Gobi Lakes Valley desert steppe''', ecoregion lies north of Alashan Plateau semi-desert, between the Gobi Altai range to the south and the [[Khangai Mountains]] to the north.\n* '''[[Dzungarian Basin]] semi-desert''', includes the desert basin lying between the Altai mountains on the north and the [[Tian Shan]] range on the south. It includes the northern portion of China's Xinjiang province and extends into the southeastern corner of Mongolia. The Alashan Plateau semi-desert lies to the east, and the [[Emin Valley steppe]] to the west, on the China-[[Kazakhstan]] border.\n* '''[[Tian Shan range]]''', separates the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert from the [[Taklamakan Desert]], which is a low, sandy desert basin surrounded by the high mountain ranges of the Tibetan Plateau to the south and the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]] to the west. The Taklamakan Desert ecoregion includes the [[Desert of Lop]].\n\n===Eastern Gobi desert steppe===\n{{main|Eastern Gobi desert steppe}}\n[[File:Khulan.JPG|thumb|A Khulan ([[Mongolian wild ass]]) on a hill in the eastern Gobi of [[Mongolia]] at sunset.]]\nThe surface is extremely diversified, although there are no great differences in vertical elevation. Between [[Ulaanbaatar]] ({{Coord|48|00|N|107|00|E|}}) and the small lake of Iren-dubasu-nor ({{Coord|43|45|N|111|50|E|}}), the surface is greatly eroded. Broad flat depressions and basins are separated by groups of flat-topped mountains of relatively low elevation {{convert|150|to|180|m|abbr=on}}), through which archaic rocks crop out as crags and isolated rugged masses. The floors of the depressions lie mostly between {{convert|900|to|1000|m|abbr=on}} above sea-level. Farther south, between Iren-dutiasu-nor and the [[Yellow River]], comes a region of broad tablelands alternating with flat plains, the latter ranging at altitudes of 1000\u20131100&nbsp;m and the former at {{convert|1070|to|1200|m|abbr=on}}. The slopes of the plateaus are more or less steep, and are sometimes penetrated by \"bays\" of the lowlands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAs the border-range of the Hyangan is approached, the country steadily rises up to {{convert|1370|m|abbr=on}} and then to {{convert|1630|m|abbr=on}}. Here small lakes frequently fill the depressions, though the water in them is generally salt or brackish. Both here and for {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|mi|0}} south of Ulaanbaatar, streams are frequent and grass grows more or less abundantly. Through all the central parts, until the bordering mountains are reached, trees and shrubs are utterly absent. Clay and sand are the predominant formations; the watercourses, especially in the north, being frequently excavated {{convert|2|to|abbr=on|3|m}} deep. In many places in the flat, dry valleys or depressions farther south, beds of [[loess]], {{convert|5|to|6|m|abbr=on}} thick, are exposed. West of the route from Ulaanbaatar to [[Kalgan]], the country presents approximately the same general features, except that the mountains are not so irregularly scattered in groups but have more strongly defined strikes, mostly east to west, west-north-west to east-south-east, and west-south-west to east-north-east.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe altitudes are higher, those of the lowlands ranging from {{convert|1000|to|1700|m|abbr=on}}, and those of the ranges from {{convert|200|to|500|m|abbr=on}} higher, though in a few cases they reach altitudes of {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on}}. The elevations do not form continuous chains, but make up a congeries of short ridges and groups rising from a common base and intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, gullies, glens and basins. But the [[Plateaus|tablelands]], built up of the horizontal red deposits of the Han-gai ([[Vladimir Obruchev|Obruchev]]'s Gobi formation) which are characteristic of the southern parts of eastern Mongolia, are absent here or occur only in one locality, near the Shara-muren river. They are greatly intersected by gullies or dry watercourses. Water is scarce, with no streams, no lakes, no wells, and precipitation falls seldom. The prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest, and the pall of dust overhangs the country as in the [[Takla Makan]] and the [[desert of Lop]]. Characteristic of the flora are wild garlic, ''Kalidium gracile'', [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]], [[saxaul]], ''[[Nitraria]] schoberi'', ''[[Caragana]]'', [[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]], saltwort and the [[Poaceae|grass]] ''[[Lasiagrostis]] splendens''.<ref name=EB1911/> The taana wild onion ''[[Allium]] polyrrhizum'' is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential to produce the correct, slightly hazelnut-like flavour of camel [[Kumis|airag]] (fermented milk).\n\nThis great desert country of Gobi is crossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from [[Zhangjiakou|Kalgan]] (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar ({{convert|960|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Jiuquan]] (in [[Gansu]]) to Hami {{convert|670|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; from Hami to Beijing ({{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Hohhot]] to Hami and Barkul; and from [[Lanzhou]] (in Gansu) to Hami.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Alashan Plateau semi-desert===\n{{main|Alashan Plateau semi-desert}}\n[[File:- panoramio - \u6469\u6e38\u4e50 (47).jpg|thumb|[[Alxa Left Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\nThe southwestern portion of the Gobi, known also as the [[Hetao|Xitao]] and the [[Little Gobi]], fills the space between the great north loop of the [[Yellow River]] on the east, the [[Ejin River]] on the west, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and narrow rocky chain of [[Longshou]], {{convert|3200|to|3500|m|abbr=on}} in altitude, on the southwest. The [[Ordos Desert]], which covers the northeastern portion of the Ordos Plateau, in the great north loop of the Yellow River, is part of this ecoregion. It belongs to the middle basin of the three great depressions into which Potanin divides the Gobi as a whole.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n\"Topographically,\" says [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], \"it is a perfectly level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea.\" He concludes this based on the level area of the region as a whole, the hard saldgine clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them ''Tengger'' (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of {{convert|1000|to|1500|m|abbr=on}}, this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a chequered network of hills and broken ranges going up 300&nbsp;m higher. The vegetation is confined to a few varieties of bushes and a dozen kinds of grasses and herbs, the most conspicuous being saxaul (''[[Haloxylon ammondendron]]'') and ''[[Agriophyllum gobicum]]''. The others include prickly [[convolvulus]], field wormwood (''[[Artemisia campestris]]''), [[acacia]], ''[[Inula ammophila]]'', ''[[Sophora flavescens]]'', ''[[Convolvulus ammanii]]'', ''[[Peganum]]'' and ''[[Astragalus]]'' species, but all dwarfed, deformed and starved. The fauna consists of little but antelope, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog, marten, numerous lizards and a few birds, e.g. the sandgrouse, lark, stonechat, sparrow, crane, [[Henderson's ground jay]] (''[[Podoces hendersoni]]''), [[horned lark]] (''[[Eremophila alpestris]]''), and [[crested lark]] (''[[Galerida cristata]]'').<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Dzungarian Basin semi-desert===\n{{quote|The structure here is that of the mighty [[Tian Shan|T'ien Shan]], or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'\u2014that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants. Gobi mutton is the most aromatic in the world.<ref>Lattimore (1973), p. 238.</ref>}}\n\nThe Yulduz valley or valley of the Haidag-gol ({{Coord|43|N|83|E |region:CN-65}}\u2013{{Coord|43|N|86|E |region:CN-65}}) is a mini desert enclosed by two prominent members of the Shanashen Trahen Osh mountain range, namely the chucis and the kracenard pine rallies, running perpendicular and far from one another. As they proceed south, they transcend and transpose, sweeping back on east and west respectively, with [[Lake Bosten]] in between. These two ranges mark the northern and the southern edges respectively of a great swelling, which extends eastward for nearly twenty degrees of longitude. On its northern side, the Chol-tagh descends steeply, and its foot is fringed by a string of deep depressions, ranging from [[Lukchun]] ({{convert|130|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level) to [[Hami City|Hami]] ({{convert|850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea-level). To the south of the Kuruk-tagh lie the desert of [[Lop Nur]], the [[Kum-tagh]] desert, and the valley of the [[Bulunzir-gol]]. To this great swelling, which arches up between the two border-ranges of the Chol-tagh and Kuruk-tagh, the [[Mongols]] give the name of ''[[Ghashuun-Gobi]]'' or \"Salt Desert\". It is some {{convert|130|to|160|km|abbr=on}} across from north to south, and is traversed by a number of minor parallel ranges, ridges and chains of hills. Down its middle runs a broad stony valley, {{convert|40|to|80|km|abbr=on}} wide, at an elevation of {{convert|900|to|1370|m|abbr=on}}. The Chol-tagh, which reaches an average altitude of {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, is absolutely sterile, and its northern foot rests upon a narrow belt of barren sand, which leads down to the depressions mentioned above.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Kuruk-tagh is the greatly disintegrated, denuded and wasted relic of a mountain range which used to be of incomparably greater magnitude. In the west, between Lake Bosten and the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], it consists of two, possibly of three, principal ranges, which, although broken in continuity, run generally parallel to one another, and embrace between them numerous minor chains of heights. These minor ranges, together with the principal ranges, divide the region into a series of long; narrow valleys, mostly parallel to one another and to the enclosing mountain chains, which descend like terraced steps, on the one side towards the depression of Lukchun and on the other towards the desert of Lop.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn many cases these latitudinal valleys are barred transversely by ridges or spurs, generally elevations en masse of the bottom of the valley. Where such elevations exist, there is generally found, on the east side of the transverse ridge, a cauldron-shaped depression, which some time or other has been the bottom of a former lake, but is now nearly a dry salt-basin. The surface configuration is in fact markedly similar to that which occurs in the inter-mount latitudinal valleys of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. The [[hydrography]] of the Ghashiun-Gobi and the Kuruk-tagh is determined by these chequered arrangements of the latitudinal valleys. Most of the principal streams, instead of flowing straight down these valleys, cross them diagonally and only turn west after they have cut their way through one or more of the transverse barrier ranges.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nTo the highest range on the great swelling [[Grigory Grum-Grshimailo]] gives the name of [[Tuge-tau]], its altitude being {{convert|2700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the level of the sea and some {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the crown of the swelling itself. This range he considers to belong to the [[Choltagh]] system, whereas [[Sven Hedin]] would assign it to the Kuruk-tagh. This last, which is pretty certainly identical with the range of [[Kharateken-ula]] (also known as the [[Kyzyl-sanghir]], [[Sinir]], and [[Singher Mountains]]), that overlooks the southern shore of the Lake Bosten, though parted from it by the drift-sand desert of [[Ak-bel-kum]] (White Pass Sands), has at first a west-northwest to east-southeast strike, but it gradually curves round like a scimitar towards the east-northeast and at the same time gradually decreases in elevation.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 91\u00b0 east, while the principal range of the Kuruk-tagh system wheels to the east-northeast, four of its subsidiary ranges terminate, or rather die away somewhat suddenly, on the brink of a long narrow depression (in which Sven Hedin sees a northeast bay of the former great Central Asian lake of Lop-nor), having over against them the \u00e9cheloned terminals of similar subordinate ranges of the [[Pe-shan]] (Boy-san) system (see below). The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same relatively favoured spots, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of [[Haloxylon ammodendron|saxaul]] ''(Haloxylon)'', ''[[Anabasis (plant)|anabasis]]'', reeds (kamish), [[tamarisk]]s, [[Populus|poplars]], and [[Ephedra]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==European exploration==\nThe Gobi had a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples. By the early 20th century, the region was under the nominal control of Manchu-China, and inhabited mostly by [[Mongol]]s, [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and [[Kazakhs]]. The Gobi Desert as a whole was known only very imperfectly to outsiders, and information was confined to observations by individual travellers from their respective itineraries across the desert.

It extends from the [[Inner Mongolia]]n [[Plateau]] in China northward into Mongolia. It includes the [[Yin Mountains]] and many low-lying areas with salt pans and small ponds. It is bounded by the [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland]] to the north, the Yellow River Plain to the southeast, and the Alashan Plateau semi-desert to the southeast and east.\n* '''Alashan Plateau semi-desert''', lies west and southwest of the Eastern Gobi desert steppe. It consists of the desert basins and low mountains lying between the Gobi Altai range on the north, the [[Helan Mountains]] to the southeast, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and northeastern portion of the Tibetan Plateau on the southwest.\n* '''Gobi Lakes Valley desert steppe''', ecoregion lies north of Alashan Plateau semi-desert, between the Gobi Altai range to the south and the [[Khangai Mountains]] to the north.\n* '''[[Dzungarian Basin]] semi-desert''', includes the desert basin lying between the Altai mountains on the north and the [[Tian Shan]] range on the south. It includes the northern portion of China's Xinjiang province and extends into the southeastern corner of Mongolia. The Alashan Plateau semi-desert lies to the east, and the [[Emin Valley steppe]] to the west, on the China-[[Kazakhstan]] border.\n* '''[[Tian Shan range]]''', separates the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert from the [[Taklamakan Desert]], which is a low, sandy desert basin surrounded by the high mountain ranges of the Tibetan Plateau to the south and the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]] to the west. The Taklamakan Desert ecoregion includes the [[Desert of Lop]].\n\n===Eastern Gobi desert steppe===\n[[File:Khulan.JPG|thumb|A Khulan ([[Mongolian wild ass]]) on a hill in the eastern Gobi of [[Mongolia]] at sunset.]]\nThe surface is extremely diversified, although there are no great differences in vertical elevation. Between [[Ulaanbaatar]] ({{Coord|48|00|N|107|00|E|}}) and the small lake of Iren-dubasu-nor ({{Coord|43|45|N|111|50|E|}}), the surface is greatly eroded. Broad flat depressions and basins are separated by groups of flat-topped mountains of relatively low elevation {{convert|150|to|180|m|abbr=on}}), through which archaic rocks crop out as crags and isolated rugged masses. The floors of the depressions lie mostly between {{convert|900|to|1000|m|abbr=on}} above sea-level. Farther south, between Iren-dutiasu-nor and the [[Yellow River]], comes a region of broad tablelands alternating with flat plains, the latter ranging at altitudes of 1000\u20131100&nbsp;m and the former at {{convert|1070|to|1200|m|abbr=on}}. The slopes of the plateaus are more or less steep, and are sometimes penetrated by \"bays\" of the lowlands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAs the border-range of the Hyangan is approached, the country steadily rises up to {{convert|1370|m|abbr=on}} and then to {{convert|1630|m|abbr=on}}. Here small lakes frequently fill the depressions, though the water in them is generally salt or brackish. Both here and for {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|mi|0}} south of Ulaanbaatar, streams are frequent and grass grows more or less abundantly. Through all the central parts, until the bordering mountains are reached, trees and shrubs are utterly absent. Clay and sand are the predominant formations; the watercourses, especially in the north, being frequently excavated {{convert|2|to|abbr=on|3|m}} deep. In many places in the flat, dry valleys or depressions farther south, beds of [[loess]], {{convert|5|to|6|m|abbr=on}} thick, are exposed. West of the route from Ulaanbaatar to [[Kalgan]], the country presents approximately the same general features, except that the mountains are not so irregularly scattered in groups but have more strongly defined strikes, mostly east to west, west-north-west to east-south-east, and west-south-west to east-north-east.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe altitudes are higher, those of the lowlands ranging from {{convert|1000|to|1700|m|abbr=on}}, and those of the ranges from {{convert|200|to|500|m|abbr=on}} higher, though in a few cases they reach altitudes of {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on}}. The elevations do not form continuous chains, but make up a congeries of short ridges and groups rising from a common base and intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, gullies, glens and basins. But the [[Plateaus|tablelands]], built up of the horizontal red deposits of the Han-gai ([[Vladimir Obruchev|Obruchev]]'s Gobi formation) which are characteristic of the southern parts of eastern Mongolia, are absent here or occur only in one locality, near the Shara-muren river. They are greatly intersected by gullies or dry watercourses. Water is scarce, with no streams, no lakes, no wells, and precipitation falls seldom. The prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest, and the pall of dust overhangs the country as in the [[Takla Makan]] and the [[desert of Lop]]. Characteristic of the flora are wild garlic, ''Kalidium gracile'', [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]], [[saxaul]], ''[[Nitraria]] schoberi'', ''[[Caragana]]'', [[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]], saltwort and the [[Poaceae|grass]] ''[[Lasiagrostis]] splendens''.<ref name=EB1911/> The taana wild onion ''[[Allium]] polyrrhizum'' is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential to produce the correct, slightly hazelnut-like flavour of camel [[Kumis|airag]] (fermented milk).\n\nThis great desert country of Gobi is crossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from [[Zhangjiakou|Kalgan]] (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar ({{convert|960|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Jiuquan]] (in [[Gansu]]) to Hami {{convert|670|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; from Hami to Beijing ({{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Hohhot]] to Hami and Barkul; and from [[Lanzhou]] (in Gansu) to Hami.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Alashan Plateau semi-desert===\n{{main|Alashan Plateau semi-desert}}\n[[File:- panoramio - \u6469\u6e38\u4e50 (47).jpg|thumb|[[Alxa Left Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\nThe southwestern portion of the Gobi, known also as the [[Hetao|Xitao]] and the [[Little Gobi]], fills the space between the great north loop of the [[Yellow River]] on the east, the [[Ejin River]] on the west, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and narrow rocky chain of [[Longshou]], {{convert|3200|to|3500|m|abbr=on}} in altitude, on the southwest. The [[Ordos Desert]], which covers the northeastern portion of the Ordos Plateau, in the great north loop of the Yellow River, is part of this ecoregion. It belongs to the middle basin of the three great depressions into which Potanin divides the Gobi as a whole.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n\"Topographically,\" says [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], \"it is a perfectly level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea.\" He concludes this based on the level area of the region as a whole, the hard saldgine clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them ''Tengger'' (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of {{convert|1000|to|1500|m|abbr=on}}, this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a chequered network of hills and broken ranges going up 300&nbsp;m higher. The vegetation is confined to a few varieties of bushes and a dozen kinds of grasses and herbs, the most conspicuous being saxaul (''[[Haloxylon ammondendron]]'') and ''[[Agriophyllum gobicum]]''. The others include prickly [[convolvulus]], field wormwood (''[[Artemisia campestris]]''), [[acacia]], ''[[Inula ammophila]]'', ''[[Sophora flavescens]]'', ''[[Convolvulus ammanii]]'', ''[[Peganum]]'' and ''[[Astragalus]]'' species, but all dwarfed, deformed and starved. The fauna consists of little but antelope, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog, marten, numerous lizards and a few birds, e.g. the sandgrouse, lark, stonechat, sparrow, crane, [[Henderson's ground jay]] (''[[Podoces hendersoni]]''), [[horned lark]] (''[[Eremophila alpestris]]''), and [[crested lark]] (''[[Galerida cristata]]'').<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Dzungarian Basin semi-desert===\n{{quote|The structure here is that of the mighty [[Tian Shan|T'ien Shan]], or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'\u2014that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants. Gobi mutton is the most aromatic in the world.<ref>Lattimore (1973), p. 238.</ref>}}\n\nThe Yulduz valley or valley of the Haidag-gol ({{Coord|43|N|83|E |region:CN-65}}\u2013{{Coord|43|N|86|E |region:CN-65}}) is a mini desert enclosed by two prominent members of the Shanashen Trahen Osh mountain range, namely the chucis and the kracenard pine rallies, running perpendicular and far from one another. As they proceed south, they transcend and transpose, sweeping back on east and west respectively, with [[Lake Bosten]] in between. These two ranges mark the northern and the southern edges respectively of a great swelling, which extends eastward for nearly twenty degrees of longitude. On its northern side, the Chol-tagh descends steeply, and its foot is fringed by a string of deep depressions, ranging from [[Lukchun]] ({{convert|130|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level) to [[Hami City|Hami]] ({{convert|850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea-level). To the south of the Kuruk-tagh lie the desert of [[Lop Nur]], the [[Kum-tagh]] desert, and the valley of the [[Bulunzir-gol]]. To this great swelling, which arches up between the two border-ranges of the Chol-tagh and Kuruk-tagh, the [[Mongols]] give the name of ''[[Ghashuun-Gobi]]'' or \"Salt Desert\". It is some {{convert|130|to|160|km|abbr=on}} across from north to south, and is traversed by a number of minor parallel ranges, ridges and chains of hills. Down its middle runs a broad stony valley, {{convert|40|to|80|km|abbr=on}} wide, at an elevation of {{convert|900|to|1370|m|abbr=on}}. The Chol-tagh, which reaches an average altitude of {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, is absolutely sterile, and its northern foot rests upon a narrow belt of barren sand, which leads down to the depressions mentioned above.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Kuruk-tagh is the greatly disintegrated, denuded and wasted relic of a mountain range which used to be of incomparably greater magnitude. In the west, between Lake Bosten and the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], it consists of two, possibly of three, principal ranges, which, although broken in continuity, run generally parallel to one another, and embrace between them numerous minor chains of heights. These minor ranges, together with the principal ranges, divide the region into a series of long; narrow valleys, mostly parallel to one another and to the enclosing mountain chains, which descend like terraced steps, on the one side towards the depression of Lukchun and on the other towards the desert of Lop.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn many cases these latitudinal valleys are barred transversely by ridges or spurs, generally elevations en masse of the bottom of the valley. Where such elevations exist, there is generally found, on the east side of the transverse ridge, a cauldron-shaped depression, which some time or other has been the bottom of a former lake, but is now nearly a dry salt-basin. The surface configuration is in fact markedly similar to that which occurs in the inter-mount latitudinal valleys of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. The [[hydrography]] of the Ghashiun-Gobi and the Kuruk-tagh is determined by these chequered arrangements of the latitudinal valleys. Most of the principal streams, instead of flowing straight down these valleys, cross them diagonally and only turn west after they have cut their way through one or more of the transverse barrier ranges.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nTo the highest range on the great swelling [[Grigory Grum-Grshimailo]] gives the name of [[Tuge-tau]], its altitude being {{convert|2700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the level of the sea and some {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the crown of the swelling itself. This range he considers to belong to the [[Choltagh]] system, whereas [[Sven Hedin]] would assign it to the Kuruk-tagh. This last, which is pretty certainly identical with the range of [[Kharateken-ula]] (also known as the [[Kyzyl-sanghir]], [[Sinir]], and [[Singher Mountains]]), that overlooks the southern shore of the Lake Bosten, though parted from it by the drift-sand desert of [[Ak-bel-kum]] (White Pass Sands), has at first a west-northwest to east-southeast strike, but it gradually curves round like a scimitar towards the east-northeast and at the same time gradually decreases in elevation.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 91\u00b0 east, while the principal range of the Kuruk-tagh system wheels to the east-northeast, four of its subsidiary ranges terminate, or rather die away somewhat suddenly, on the brink of a long narrow depression (in which Sven Hedin sees a northeast bay of the former great Central Asian lake of Lop-nor), having over against them the \u00e9cheloned terminals of similar subordinate ranges of the [[Pe-shan]] (Boy-san) system (see below). The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same relatively favoured spots, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of [[Haloxylon ammodendron|saxaul]] ''(Haloxylon)'', ''[[Anabasis (plant)|anabasis]]'', reeds (kamish), [[tamarisk]]s, [[Populus|poplars]], and [[Ephedra]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==European exploration==\nThe Gobi had a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples. By the early 20th century, the region was under the nominal control of Manchu-China, and inhabited mostly by [[Mongol]]s, [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and [[Kazakhs]]. The Gobi Desert as a whole was known only very imperfectly to outsiders, and information was confined to observations by individual travellers from their respective itineraries across the desert.
