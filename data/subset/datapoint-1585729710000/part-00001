The jaguar's present range extends from [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Mexico]] in [[North America]], across much of [[Central America]], and south to [[Paraguay]] and northern [[Argentina]] in [[South America]]. Though there are single cats now living within the Western United States, the species has largely been [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from the [[United States]] since the early 20th century. It is listed as [[Near Threatened]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]; and its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation of habitat]].\n\nOverall, the jaguar is the largest native cat species of the New World and the [[List of largest cats|third largest in the world]]. This spotted cat closely resembles the [[leopard]], but is usually larger and sturdier. It ranges across a variety of forested and open terrains, but its preferred [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] is [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest]], [[swamp]]s and wooded regions. The jaguar enjoys swimming and is largely a [[Solitude|solitary]], opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush [[predator]] at [[apex predator|the top of the food chain]]. As a [[keystone species]] it plays an important role in stabilizing [[ecosystem]]s and regulating prey populations.\n\nWhile international trade in jaguars or their body parts is prohibited, the cat is still frequently killed, particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in South America. Although reduced, its range remains large. Given its historical distribution, the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American cultures]], including those of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Aztec]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word 'jaguar' is thought to derive from the [[Tupian languages|Tupian]] word ''yaguara'', meaning \"beast of prey\".<ref name=etymology>{{cite web |author=Harper, D. |year=2001\u20132017 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=jaguar |title=Jaguar | work = [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|publisher=Douglas Harper}}</ref> The word entered English presumably via the Amazonian [[Pidgin|trade language]] [[Nheengatu language|Tupinamb\u00e1]], via [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''jaguar''.<ref name=r1/><ref name=r2/> The specific word for jaguar is ''yaguaret\u00e9'', with the suffix -''et\u00e9'' meaning \"real\" or \"true\".<ref name=r3/>\n\nThe word 'panther' derives from [[classical Latin]] ''panth\u0113ra'', itself from the [[ancient Greek]] ''p\u00e1nth\u0113r'' (\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1).<ref>{{cite web |author1=Liddell, H.

The jaguar has also been termed a [[keystone species]], as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] and [[Seed predation|granivorous]] mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems.<ref name=foodhabits/><ref name=PHOENIX/> However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases in the absence of the keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects.<ref name=MONGA/> However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the [[keystone predator]] hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.<ref name=r30/>\n\nThe jaguar also has an effect on other predators. The jaguar and the cougar, which is the next-largest feline of South America, but the biggest in Central or North America,<ref name=foodhabits/> are often [[sympatric]] (related species sharing overlapping territory) and have often been studied in conjunction. The jaguar tends to take larger prey, usually over {{convert|22|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the cougar smaller, usually between {{convert|2|and|22|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, reducing the latter's size.<ref name=\"Brakefield\"/><ref name=r31/> This situation may be advantageous to the cougar. Its broader prey niche, including its ability to take smaller prey, may give it an advantage over the jaguar in human-altered landscapes;<ref name=foodhabits/> while both are classified as [[near threatened|near-threatened]] species, the cougar has a significantly larger current distribution.

The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, listening for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an [[apex predator]] in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses as large as a heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/>\n\nOn killing prey, the jaguar will drag the carcass to a thicket or other secluded spot.

When adapted to the prey, the jaguar has been shown to take cattle as a large portion of its diet; while land clearance for grazing is a problem for the species, the jaguar population may have increased when cattle were first introduced to South America, as the animals took advantage of the new prey base. This willingness to take livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full-time jaguar hunters.<ref name=JSSP/>\n\nThe skins of wild cats and other mammals have been highly valued by the fur trade for many decades. From the beginning of the 20th-century Jaguars were hunted in large numbers, but over-harvest and habitat destruction reduced the availability and induced hunters and traders to gradually shift to smaller species by the 1960s. The international trade of jaguar skins had its largest boom between the end of the [[Second World War]] and the early 1970, due to the growing economy and lack of regulations. From 1967 onwards, the regulations introduced by national laws and international agreements diminished the reported international trade from as high as 13000 skins in 1967, through 7000 skins in 1969, until it became negligible after 1976, although illegal trade and smuggling continue to be a problem. During this period, the biggest exporters were Brazil and Paraguay, and the biggest importers were the US and [[Germany]].<ref name=\"SkinTrade\">{{cite book |last1=Broad |first1=S- |title=The harvest of and trade in Latin American spotted cats (Felidae) and otters (Lutrinae) |date=1987|publisher=IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre|location=Cambridge, UK|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/119261|accessdate=8 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe jaguar is listed on [[CITES Appendix I]], which means that all international trade in jaguars or their body parts is prohibited.

Specific areas of high importance for jaguar conservation, so-called \"Jaguar Conservation Units\" (JCU) were determined in 2000. These are large areas inhabited by at least 50 jaguars. Each unit was assessed and evaluated on the basis of size, connectivity, habitat quality for both jaguar and prey, and jaguar population status. That way, 51 Jaguar Conservation Units were determined in 36 geographic regions as priority areas for jaguar conservation including:<ref name=Sanderson2002/>\n* the [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Madre]] of Mexico\n* the Selva Maya tropical forests extending over Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala\n* the [[Choc\u00f3-Dari\u00e9n moist forests]] from Honduras, Panama to Colombia\n* [[Sierra de Tamaulipas]]\n* [[Venezuelan Llanos]]\n* northern [[Cerrado]] and [[Amazon basin]] in Brazil\n* [[Misiones Province]] in Argentina\n\nRecent studies underlined that to maintain the robust exchange across the jaguar gene pool necessary for maintaining the species, it is important that jaguar habitats are interconnected. To facilitate this, a new project, the [[Paseo del Jaguar]], has been established to connect several jaguar hotspots.<ref name=r35/>\n\nIn 1986, the [[Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary]] was established in Belize as the world's first protected area for jaguar conservation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weckel, M., Giuliano, W. and Silver, S. |year=2006 |title=Cockscomb revisited: jaguar diet in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, Belize |journal=Biotropica |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=687\u2013690 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0de6ca561c58392453101b32240599f5e343b810|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00190.x }}</ref>\n\nGiven the inaccessibility of much of the species' range, particularly the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular [[bioregion]]s, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600\u20131,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125\u2013180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km<sup>2</sup> (2400-mi<sup>2</sup>) [[Calakmul Biosphere Reserve]], with another 350 in the state of [[Chiapas]]. The adjoining [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (9,000&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>), may have 465\u2013550 animals.<ref name=GUIDELINESPOPULATION/> Work employing [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] [[telemetry]] in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats.<ref name=r34/>\n\n===Approaches===\nIn setting up protected reserves, efforts generally also have to be focused on the surrounding areas, as jaguars are unlikely to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation, especially if the population is increasing in size. Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching are essential to make conservation areas effective.<ref name=gutierrez/>\n\nTo estimate population sizes within specific areas and to keep track of individual jaguars, [[camera trap]]ping and [[Telemetry#Fishery and wildlife research and management|wildlife tracking telemetry]] are widely used, and feces may be sought out with the help of detector dogs to study jaguar health and diet.<ref name=soisalo/><ref name=furtado/>\nCurrent conservation efforts often focus on educating ranch owners and promoting [[ecotourism]].<ref name=WWF/> The jaguar is generally defined as an [[umbrella species]] \u2013 its home range and habitat requirements are sufficiently broad that, if protected, numerous other species of smaller range will also be protected.<ref name=r33/> Umbrella species serve as \"mobile links\" at the landscape scale, in the jaguar's case through predation. Conservation organizations may thus focus on providing viable, connected habitat for the jaguar, with the knowledge other species will also benefit.<ref name=WWF/>\n\n[[Ecotourism]] setups are being used to generate public interest in charismatic animals such as the jaguar, while at the same time generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts. Audits done in Africa have shown that ecotourism has helped in African cat conservation. As with large African cats, a key concern in jaguar ecotourism is the considerable habitat space the species requires, so if ecotourism is used to aid in jaguar conservation, some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact, or how new ecosystems that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population will be put into place.<ref name=mossaz/>\n\n===The United States===\n{{Main|North American jaguar}}\nThe only extant cat native to North America that roars,<ref name=TwoSightings/> the jaguar was recorded as an animal of the Americas by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1799.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/writingsthomasj10statgoog/writingsthomasj10statgoog_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"The writings of Thomas Jefferson\"}}</ref> Jaguars are still occasionally sighted in [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], such as El Jefe,<ref>{{cite web |title=Student project results in new jaguar sighting |author=Jessica Lamberton-Moreno |date=8 September 2015 |publisher=Sky Island Alliance |url=http://www.skyislandalliance.org/2015/09/new-jaguar-sighting/ |accessdate=4 January 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Only Known Jaguar in U.S. Filmed in Rare Video |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160203-jaguars-nation-animals-science-rare/ |website=National Geographic News |access-date=4 February 2016 |first=Brian |last=Handwerk |date=3 February 2016}}</ref> prompting actions for its conservation by authorities.<ref name=TwoSightings/> For example, on 20 August 2012, the USFWS proposed setting aside 838,232 acres in Arizona and New Mexico \u2013 an area larger than Rhode Island \u2013 as critical jaguar habitat.<ref name=\"SA2012\">{{cite journal |title=Kitty Corner: Jaguars Win Critical Habitat in U.S. |first=Susan H. |last=Greenberg |journal=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kitty-corner-jaguars-win-critical-habitat-in-us |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007130344/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kitty-corner-jaguars-win-critical-habitat-in-us/ |url-status=live |date=21 August 2012 |archivedate=7 October 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==In mythology and culture==\n===Pre-Columbian Americas===\n{{multiple image\n |align=right\n |direction=vertical\n |image1=Jaguar warrior.jpg\n |caption1=Jaguar warrior in the Aztec culture\n |width1=220\n |image2=Chilam Balam Ixil.jpg\n |caption2=Copy of the Book of Chilam Balam of Ixil in the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)]]\n |width2=220\n}}\n{{multiple image\n |align=left\n |direction=vertical\n |image1=Statuette Karaj\u00e0 MHNT.ETH.2010.24.88.jpg\n |caption1=Statuette of Karaj\u00e0 in the [[Museum of Toulouse]]\n |width1=220\n |image2=MocheJaguarLarcoMuseum.jpg\n |caption2=Moche jaguar figurine dating to 300&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]], at the [[Larco Museum]] in [[Lima]], Peru\n |width2=220\n}}\n{{See also|Jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures}}\nIn [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Central and South America, the jaguar was a symbol of power and strength.

In the later [[Maya civilization]], the jaguar was believed to facilitate communication between the living and the dead and to protect the royal household. The Maya saw these powerful felines as their companions in the spiritual world, and a number of Maya rulers bore names that incorporated the Mayan word for jaguar (''b'alam'' in many of the [[Mayan languages]]). ''Balam'' (''Jaguar'') remains a common Maya surname, and it is also the name of [[Chilam Balam]], a legendary author to whom are attributed 17th and 18th-centuries Maya [[miscellanies]] preserving much important knowledge. The [[Aztec]] civilization shared this image of the jaguar as the representative of the ruler and as a warrior. The Aztecs formed an elite warrior class known as the [[Jaguar warrior|Jaguar Knights]]. In [[Aztec mythology]], the jaguar was considered to be the [[totem]] animal of the powerful deity [[Tezcatlipoca]].<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/><ref name=b3/> Remains of jaguar bones were discovered in a burial site in [[Guatemala]] which indicates that [[Mayans]] kept jaguars as [[pets]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/ancient-mayans-probably-kept-jaguars-as-pets-and-raised-dogs-for-food/|date=March 20, 2018|title=Ancient Mayans Probably Kept Jaguars As Pets And Raised Dogs For Food|publisher=[[IFLScience]]|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary culture===\nThe jaguar and its name are widely used as a symbol in contemporary culture.

The jaguar's present range extends from [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Mexico]] in [[North America]], across much of [[Central America]], and south to [[Paraguay]] and northern [[Argentina]] in [[South America]]. Though there are single cats now living within the Western United States, the species has largely been [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from the [[United States]] since the early 20th century. It is listed as [[Near Threatened]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]; and its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation of habitat]].\n\nOverall, the jaguar is the largest native cat species of the New World and the [[List of largest cats|third largest in the world]]. This spotted cat closely resembles the [[leopard]], but is usually larger and sturdier. It ranges across a variety of forested and open terrains, but its preferred [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] is [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest]], [[swamp]]s and wooded regions. The jaguar enjoys swimming and is largely a [[Solitude|solitary]], opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush [[predator]] at [[apex predator|the top of the food chain]]. As a [[keystone species]] it plays an important role in stabilizing [[ecosystem]]s and regulating prey populations.\n\nWhile international trade in jaguars or their body parts is prohibited, the cat is still frequently killed, particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in South America. Although reduced, its range remains large.

The jaguar has also been termed a [[keystone species]], as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] and [[Seed predation|granivorous]] mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems.<ref name=foodhabits/><ref name=PHOENIX/> However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases in the absence of the keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects.<ref name=MONGA/> However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the [[keystone predator]] hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.<ref name=r30/>\n\nThe jaguar also has an effect on other predators. The jaguar and the cougar, which is the next-largest feline of South America, but the biggest in Central or North America,<ref name=foodhabits/> are often [[sympatric]] (related species sharing overlapping territory) and have often been studied in conjunction. The jaguar tends to take larger prey, usually over {{convert|22|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the cougar smaller, usually between {{convert|2|and|22|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, reducing the latter's size.<ref name=\"Brakefield\"/><ref name=r31/> This situation may be advantageous to the cougar. Its broader prey niche, including its ability to take smaller prey, may give it an advantage over the jaguar in human-altered landscapes;<ref name=foodhabits/> while both are classified as [[near threatened|near-threatened]] species, the cougar has a significantly larger current distribution.

When attacking [[sea turtle]]s, including the huge [[leatherback sea turtle]] which weighs about {{convert|385|kg|lb|abbr=on}} on average, as they try to nest on beaches, the jaguar will bite at the head, often beheading the prey, before dragging it off to eat.<ref>''Travellers' Wildlife Guide to Costa Rica'' by Les Beletsky.

Trinity College (1897), New York.</ref>\n\nThe jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush rather than a chase predator. The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, listening for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an [[apex predator]] in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses as large as a heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/>\n\nOn killing prey, the jaguar will drag the carcass to a thicket or other secluded spot.

The international trade of jaguar skins had its largest boom between the end of the [[Second World War]] and the early 1970, due to the growing economy and lack of regulations. From 1967 onwards, the regulations introduced by national laws and international agreements diminished the reported international trade from as high as 13000 skins in 1967, through 7000 skins in 1969, until it became negligible after 1976, although illegal trade and smuggling continue to be a problem.

Specific areas of high importance for jaguar conservation, so-called \"Jaguar Conservation Units\" (JCU) were determined in 2000. These are large areas inhabited by at least 50 jaguars. Each unit was assessed and evaluated on the basis of size, connectivity, habitat quality for both jaguar and prey, and jaguar population status. That way, 51 Jaguar Conservation Units were determined in 36 geographic regions as priority areas for jaguar conservation including:<ref name=Sanderson2002/>\n* the [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Madre]] of Mexico\n* the Selva Maya tropical forests extending over Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala\n* the [[Choc\u00f3-Dari\u00e9n moist forests]] from Honduras, Panama to Colombia\n* [[Sierra de Tamaulipas]]\n* [[Venezuelan Llanos]]\n* northern [[Cerrado]] and [[Amazon basin]] in Brazil\n* [[Misiones Province]] in Argentina\n\nRecent studies underlined that to maintain the robust exchange across the jaguar gene pool necessary for maintaining the species, it is important that jaguar habitats are interconnected. To facilitate this, a new project, the [[Paseo del Jaguar]], has been established to connect several jaguar hotspots.<ref name=r35/>\n\nIn 1986, the [[Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary]] was established in Belize as the world's first protected area for jaguar conservation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weckel, M., Giuliano, W. and Silver, S. |year=2006 |title=Cockscomb revisited: jaguar diet in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, Belize |journal=Biotropica |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=687\u2013690 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0de6ca561c58392453101b32240599f5e343b810|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00190.x }}</ref>\n\nGiven the inaccessibility of much of the species' range, particularly the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular [[bioregion]]s, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600\u20131,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125\u2013180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km<sup>2</sup> (2400-mi<sup>2</sup>) [[Calakmul Biosphere Reserve]], with another 350 in the state of [[Chiapas]]. The adjoining [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (9,000&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>), may have 465\u2013550 animals.<ref name=GUIDELINESPOPULATION/> Work employing [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] [[telemetry]] in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats.<ref name=r34/>\n\n===Approaches===\nIn setting up protected reserves, efforts generally also have to be focused on the surrounding areas, as jaguars are unlikely to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation, especially if the population is increasing in size. Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching are essential to make conservation areas effective.<ref name=gutierrez/>\n\nTo estimate population sizes within specific areas and to keep track of individual jaguars, [[camera trap]]ping and [[Telemetry#Fishery and wildlife research and management|wildlife tracking telemetry]] are widely used, and feces may be sought out with the help of detector dogs to study jaguar health and diet.<ref name=soisalo/><ref name=furtado/>\nCurrent conservation efforts often focus on educating ranch owners and promoting [[ecotourism]].<ref name=WWF/> The jaguar is generally defined as an [[umbrella species]] \u2013 its home range and habitat requirements are sufficiently broad that, if protected, numerous other species of smaller range will also be protected.<ref name=r33/> Umbrella species serve as \"mobile links\" at the landscape scale, in the jaguar's case through predation. Conservation organizations may thus focus on providing viable, connected habitat for the jaguar, with the knowledge other species will also benefit.<ref name=WWF/>\n\n[[Ecotourism]] setups are being used to generate public interest in charismatic animals such as the jaguar, while at the same time generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts. Audits done in Africa have shown that ecotourism has helped in African cat conservation. As with large African cats, a key concern in jaguar ecotourism is the considerable habitat space the species requires, so if ecotourism is used to aid in jaguar conservation, some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact, or how new ecosystems that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population will be put into place.<ref name=mossaz/>\n\n===The United States===\n{{Main|North American jaguar}}\nThe only extant cat native to North America that roars,<ref name=TwoSightings/> the jaguar was recorded as an animal of the Americas by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1799.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/writingsthomasj10statgoog/writingsthomasj10statgoog_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"The writings of Thomas Jefferson\"}}</ref> Jaguars are still occasionally sighted in [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], such as El Jefe,<ref>{{cite web |title=Student project results in new jaguar sighting |author=Jessica Lamberton-Moreno |date=8 September 2015 |publisher=Sky Island Alliance |url=http://www.skyislandalliance.org/2015/09/new-jaguar-sighting/ |accessdate=4 January 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Only Known Jaguar in U.S. Filmed in Rare Video |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160203-jaguars-nation-animals-science-rare/ |website=National Geographic News |access-date=4 February 2016 |first=Brian |last=Handwerk |date=3 February 2016}}</ref> prompting actions for its conservation by authorities.<ref name=TwoSightings/> For example, on 20 August 2012, the USFWS proposed setting aside 838,232 acres in Arizona and New Mexico \u2013 an area larger than Rhode Island \u2013 as critical jaguar habitat.<ref name=\"SA2012\">{{cite journal |title=Kitty Corner: Jaguars Win Critical Habitat in U.S. |first=Susan H. |last=Greenberg |journal=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kitty-corner-jaguars-win-critical-habitat-in-us |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007130344/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kitty-corner-jaguars-win-critical-habitat-in-us/ |url-status=live |date=21 August 2012 |archivedate=7 October 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==In mythology and culture==\n===Pre-Columbian Americas===\n{{multiple image\n |align=right\n |direction=vertical\n |image1=Jaguar warrior.jpg\n |caption1=Jaguar warrior in the Aztec culture\n |width1=220\n |image2=Chilam Balam Ixil.jpg\n |caption2=Copy of the Book of Chilam Balam of Ixil in the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)]]\n |width2=220\n}}\n{{multiple image\n |align=left\n |direction=vertical\n |image1=Statuette Karaj\u00e0 MHNT.ETH.2010.24.88.jpg\n |caption1=Statuette of Karaj\u00e0 in the [[Museum of Toulouse]]\n |width1=220\n |image2=MocheJaguarLarcoMuseum.jpg\n |caption2=Moche jaguar figurine dating to 300&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]], at the [[Larco Museum]] in [[Lima]], Peru\n |width2=220\n}}\n{{See also|Jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures}}\nIn [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Central and South America, the jaguar was a symbol of power and strength.

In the later [[Maya civilization]], the jaguar was believed to facilitate communication between the living and the dead and to protect the royal household. The Maya saw these powerful felines as their companions in the spiritual world, and a number of Maya rulers bore names that incorporated the Mayan word for jaguar (''b'alam'' in many of the [[Mayan languages]]). ''Balam'' (''Jaguar'') remains a common Maya surname, and it is also the name of [[Chilam Balam]], a legendary author to whom are attributed 17th and 18th-centuries Maya [[miscellanies]] preserving much important knowledge. The [[Aztec]] civilization shared this image of the jaguar as the representative of the ruler and as a warrior. The Aztecs formed an elite warrior class known as the [[Jaguar warrior|Jaguar Knights]]. In [[Aztec mythology]], the jaguar was considered to be the [[totem]] animal of the powerful deity [[Tezcatlipoca]].<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/><ref name=b3/> Remains of jaguar bones were discovered in a burial site in [[Guatemala]] which indicates that [[Mayans]] kept jaguars as [[pets]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/ancient-mayans-probably-kept-jaguars-as-pets-and-raised-dogs-for-food/|date=March 20, 2018|title=Ancient Mayans Probably Kept Jaguars As Pets And Raised Dogs For Food|publisher=[[IFLScience]]|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary culture===\nThe jaguar and its name are widely used as a symbol in contemporary culture.
