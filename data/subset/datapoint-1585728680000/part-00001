The North Nicobar Islands (including Car Nicobar and Battimalv) are marked by the complete absence of evergreen forests, while such forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. Grasslands occur only in the Nicobars, and while [[deciduous forests]] are common in the Andamans, they are almost absent in the Nicobars. The present forest coverage is claimed to be 86.2% of the total land area.\n\nThis atypical forest coverage is made up of twelve types, namely:\n# Giant [[evergreen forest]]\n# Andamans tropical evergreen forest\n# Southern hilltop [[tropical evergreen forest]]\n# Canebrakes\n# Wet bamboo brakes\n# Andamans semi-evergreen forest\n# Andamans moist deciduous forest\n# Andamans secondary moist deciduous forest\n# [[Littoral]] forest\n# [[Mangrove forest]]\n# Brackish water mixed forest\n# Submontane forest\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Ross island - Andaman.jpg|thumb|Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Dweep, Andaman]]\nThis tropical rain forest, despite its isolation from adjacent land masses, is surprisingly rich with a diversity of animal life.\n\nAbout 50 varieties of forest mammals are found to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some are endemic, including the Andaman wild boar. Rodents are the largest group with 26 species, followed by 14 species of bat. Among the larger mammals there are two endemic{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} varieties of wild boar, ''Sus scrofa andamanensis'' from Andaman and ''Sus scrofa nicobaricus'' from Nicobar, which are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). [[Saltwater crocodile]] is also found in abundance. The State Animal of Andaman is the [[dugong]], also known as the sea cow, which can be found in [[Little Andaman]]. Around 1962 there was an attempt to introduce the [[leopard]], which was unsuccessful because of unsuitable habitat. These were ill-considered moves as exotic introductions can cause havoc to island flora and fauna.\n\nAbout 270 species of birds are found in the territory; 14 of them are endemic, the majority to the Nicobar island group. The islands' many [[caves]] are nesting grounds for the edible-nest swiftlet, whose nests are prized in [[China]] for [[bird's nest soup]].<ref name=\"soup\">R. Sankaran (1999), ''[http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf The impact of nest collection on the Edible-nest Swiftlet in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704194845/http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf |date=4 July 2010 }}''.

Ten species are endemic to these Islands. [[Mount Harriet National Park]] is one of the richest areas of butterfly and moth diversity on these islands.\n\nThe islands are well known for prized [[shellfish]], especially from the genera ''[[Turbo (genus)|Turbo]]'', ''[[Trochus]]'', ''[[Murex]]'' and ''[[Nautilus]]''. Earliest recorded commercial exploitation began during 1929. Many cottage industries produce a range of decorative shell items. [[Giant clam]]s, [[green mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s support edible shellfishery. The shells of [[scallop]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] are burnt in kilns to produce edible [[Lime (material)|lime]].\n\nThere are 96 wildlife sanctuaries, nine national parks and one biosphere reserve in these islands.<ref>India Year Book 2015</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{India census population\n|title= Population growth\n|1951= 30971\n|1961= 63548\n|1971= 115133\n|1981= 188741\n|1991= 280661\n|2001= 356152\n|2011= 380581\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote=Source:Census of India<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>\n|1901=24649|1911=26459|1921=27086|1931=29463|1941=33768}}\n\n{{As of|2011}} [[Census of India]], the population of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands was 379,944, of which 202,330 (53.25%) were male and 177,614 (46.75%) were female.

On 1 August 1974, the Nicobar islands were hived off into another revenue district with district headquarters at Car Nicobar under a Deputy Commissioner. In 1982, the post of [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Lieutenant Governor]] was created who replaced the Chief Commissioner as the head of administration.

[[Paddy (unmilled rice)|Paddy]], the main food crop, is mostly cultivated in Andaman group of islands, whereas coconut and [[arecanut]] are the cash crops of Nicobar group of islands. Field crops, namely [[pulses]], [[oilseeds]] and vegetables are grown, followed by [[Rice|paddy]] during [[Rabi crop|Rabi]] season. Different kinds of fruits such as [[mango]], [[sapota]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[banana]], [[papaya]], pineapple and [[root crops]] are grown on hilly land owned by farmers. Spices such as pepper, [[clove]], [[nutmeg]], and [[cinnamon]] are grown under a multi-tier cropping system. [[Rubber]], [[red oil]], [[Palm (plant)|palm]], [[noni]] and [[cashew]] are grown on a limited scale in these islands.\n\n===Industry===\nThere are 1,374 registered small-scale, village and handicraft units. Two units are export-oriented in the line of fish processing activity. Apart from this, there are shell and wood-based handicraft units. There are also four medium-sized industrial units. SSI units are engaged in the production of polythene bags, PVC conduit pipes and fittings, paints and varnishes, fiberglass and mini flour mills, soft drinks, and beverages, etc. Small scale and handicraft units are also engaged in shell crafts, bakery products, rice milling, furniture making, etc.\n\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation has spread its wings in the field of tourism, fisheries, industries, and industrial financing and functions as authorised agents for [[Air India Regional|Alliance Air]].

It is an active volcano and had last erupted in 2017. It also has a mud volcano situated in Baratang island, These mud volcanoes have erupted sporadically, with recent eruptions in 2005 believed to have been associated with the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The previous major eruption recorded was on 18 February 2003. The locals call this mud volcano ''Jalki''. There are other volcanoes in the area. This island's beaches, mangrove creeks, limestone caves, and mud volcanoes are some of the physical features.\n\nIn December 2018, Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], who was on a two-day visit to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, renamed three of the islands as a tribute to [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. Ross Island was renamed as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island; Neil Island as Shaheed Island; and Havelock Island as Swaraj Island. The PM made this announcement during a speech at the Netaji Stadium, marking the 75th anniversary of the hoisting of the Indian flag by Bose there.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/01/india-strips-islands-british-colonial-names-renames-freedom/|title=Indian PM strips islands of British colonial names \u2013 and renames them after freedom fighter|last=Bedi|first=Rahul|date=1 January 2019|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103005058/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/01/india-strips-islands-british-colonial-names-renames-freedom/|archive-date=3 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-modi-renames-3-islands-of-andaman-and-nicobar/articleshow/67311674.cms |title=PM Modi renames 3 Andaman & Nicobar islands as tribute to Netaji |work=The Economic Times |date=31 December 2018 |access-date=2 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103010545/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-modi-renames-3-islands-of-andaman-and-nicobar/articleshow/67311674.cms |archive-date=3 January 2019 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n===The Sisters===\nThe Sisters are two small uninhabited islands, East Sister Island and West Sister Island, in the Andaman Archipelago, at the northern side of the Duncan Passage, about {{convert|6|km|nmi|abbr=on}} southeast of Passage Island and {{convert|18|km|nmi|abbr=on}} north of North Brother. The islands are about {{convert|820.21|feet|abbr=off}} apart, connected by a [[coral reef]]; they are covered by forests, and have rocky shores except for a beach on the northwest side of East Sister Island.\n\nBefore the British established a colony on the Andaman, the Sisters were visited occasionally by the [[Onge people]] of Little Andaman Island for fishing. The islands may have been a waystation on the way to their temporary settlement of [[Rutland Island]] between 1890 and 1930.\n\nThe islands have been designated as a [[wildlife refuge]] since 1987, with an area of {{convert|0.36|km2}}.\n\n==Flora==\n[[File:Map of Nicobar and Andaman Islands-en.svg|thumb|Map of Andaman and Nicobar Islands with an extra detailed area around Port Blair.]]\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands have a tropical rainforest canopy, made of a mixed flora with elements from Indian, Myanmar, Malaysian and endemic floral strains. So far, about 2,200 varieties of plants have been recorded, out of which 200 are endemic and 1,300 do not occur in mainland India.\n\nThe South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of [[epiphytic]] vegetation, mostly ferns, and orchids. The Middle Andamans harbours mostly moist [[deciduous forests]]. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers. The North Nicobar Islands (including Car Nicobar and Battimalv) are marked by the complete absence of evergreen forests, while such forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. Grasslands occur only in the Nicobars, and while [[deciduous forests]] are common in the Andamans, they are almost absent in the Nicobars. The present forest coverage is claimed to be 86.2% of the total land area.\n\nThis atypical forest coverage is made up of twelve types, namely:\n# Giant [[evergreen forest]]\n# Andamans tropical evergreen forest\n# Southern hilltop [[tropical evergreen forest]]\n# Canebrakes\n# Wet bamboo brakes\n# Andamans semi-evergreen forest\n# Andamans moist deciduous forest\n# Andamans secondary moist deciduous forest\n# [[Littoral]] forest\n# [[Mangrove forest]]\n# Brackish water mixed forest\n# Submontane forest\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Ross island - Andaman.jpg|thumb|Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Dweep, Andaman]]\nThis tropical rain forest, despite its isolation from adjacent land masses, is surprisingly rich with a diversity of animal life.\n\nAbout 50 varieties of forest mammals are found to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some are endemic, including the Andaman wild boar. Rodents are the largest group with 26 species, followed by 14 species of bat. Among the larger mammals there are two endemic{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} varieties of wild boar, ''Sus scrofa andamanensis'' from Andaman and ''Sus scrofa nicobaricus'' from Nicobar, which are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). [[Saltwater crocodile]] is also found in abundance. The State Animal of Andaman is the [[dugong]], also known as the sea cow, which can be found in [[Little Andaman]]. Around 1962 there was an attempt to introduce the [[leopard]], which was unsuccessful because of unsuitable habitat. These were ill-considered moves as exotic introductions can cause havoc to island flora and fauna.\n\nAbout 270 species of birds are found in the territory; 14 of them are endemic, the majority to the Nicobar island group. The islands' many [[caves]] are nesting grounds for the edible-nest swiftlet, whose nests are prized in [[China]] for [[bird's nest soup]].<ref name=\"soup\">R. Sankaran (1999), ''[http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf The impact of nest collection on the Edible-nest Swiftlet in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704194845/http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf |date=4 July 2010 }}''.

Ten species are endemic to these Islands. [[Mount Harriet National Park]] is one of the richest areas of butterfly and moth diversity on these islands.\n\nThe islands are well known for prized [[shellfish]], especially from the genera ''[[Turbo (genus)|Turbo]]'', ''[[Trochus]]'', ''[[Murex]]'' and ''[[Nautilus]]''. Earliest recorded commercial exploitation began during 1929. Many cottage industries produce a range of decorative shell items. [[Giant clam]]s, [[green mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s support edible shellfishery. The shells of [[scallop]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] are burnt in kilns to produce edible [[Lime (material)|lime]].\n\nThere are 96 wildlife sanctuaries, nine national parks and one biosphere reserve in these islands.<ref>India Year Book 2015</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{India census population\n|title= Population growth\n|1951= 30971\n|1961= 63548\n|1971= 115133\n|1981= 188741\n|1991= 280661\n|2001= 356152\n|2011= 380581\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote=Source:Census of India<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>\n|1901=24649|1911=26459|1921=27086|1931=29463|1941=33768}}\n\n{{As of|2011}} [[Census of India]], the population of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands was 379,944, of which 202,330 (53.25%) were male and 177,614 (46.75%) were female.

On 1 August 1974, the Nicobar islands were hived off into another revenue district with district headquarters at Car Nicobar under a Deputy Commissioner. In 1982, the post of [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Lieutenant Governor]] was created who replaced the Chief Commissioner as the head of administration.
