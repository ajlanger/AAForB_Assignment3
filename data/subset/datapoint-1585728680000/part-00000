The [[Television series|series]] was based on work of the men and women of the [[New South Wales Police Force#Marine Area Command|Sydney Water Police]] who fight crime around [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and surrounding locales. The show was set on and around [[Goat Island (Port Jackson)|Goat Island]] in Sydney Harbour.\n\n''Water Rats'' premiered on 12 February 1996, and ran for six seasons and 177 episodes. [[Colin Friels]] and [[Catherine McClements]] were the original stars of the series and were instrumental in the show's early success. They both departed the show in 1999. In later seasons, [[Steve Bisley]], [[Aaron Pedersen]] and [[Dee Smart]] became the show's main stars.\n\nFor the sixth and final season in 2001, the show concentrated more on the cops' personal lives rather than just focusing on the crimes committed. The Nine Network cancelled the show after six seasons. Executive Producer [[Kris Noble]] blamed escalating costs for the cancellation. However, Bisley and Smart had also just quit the show, and the series had already been suffering a ratings battle following the departure of Friels and McClements in 1999.\n\nThe final episode was broadcast in Australia on 7 August 2001.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Water Rats characters}}\n\n* [[Colin Friels]] as Det Snr Constable [[Frank Holloway]] (1996\u20131999)\n* [[Catherine McClements]] as Det Snr Constable [[Rachel Goldstein]] (1996\u20131999)\n* [[Steve Bisley]] as Det Sergeant [[Jack Christey]] (1998\u20132001)\n* [[Jay Laga'aia]] as Snr Const [[Tommy Tavita]] (1996\u20132000)\n* [[Aaron Pedersen]] as Det Constable [[Michael Reilly (character)|Michael Reilly]] (1999\u20132001)\n* [[Dee Smart]] as Det Snr Constable [[Alex St. Clare]] (2000\u20132001)\n\n===Supporting cast===\n* [[Peter Bensley]] as Snr Sgt/Chief Insp [[List of Water Rats Characters#Jeff Hawker|Jeff Hawker]] (1996\u20132001)\n* Bill Young as Chief Insp [[List of Water Rats Characters#Clarke Webb|Clarke Webb]] (1996 only)\n* Brett Partridge as Snr Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Gavin Sykes|Gavin Sykes]] (1996\u20132001)\n* [[Toni Scanlan]] as Snr Sgt [[List of Water Rats Characters#Helen Blakemore|Helen Blakemore]] (1996\u20132001)\n* [[Scott Burgess (actor)|Scott Burgess]] as Snr Sgt [[List of Water Rats Characters#Dave McCall|Dave McCall]] (1996\u20131999)\n* [[Aaron Jeffery]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Terry Watson|Terry Watson]] (1996\u20131998)\n* [[Sophie Heathcote]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Fiona Cassidy|Fiona Cassidy]] (1996\u20131997)\n* [[Raelee Hill]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Tayler Johnson|Tayler Johnson]] (1997\u20131999)\n* [[Allison Cratchley]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Emma Woods|Emma Woods]] (1998\u20132001)\n* [[Diarmid Heidenreich]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Matthew Quinn|Matthew Quinn]] (2000\u20132001)\n* [[Rebecca Smart]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Donna Janevski|Donna Janevski]] (2000\u20132001)\n\n=== Recurring roles ===\n\n* [[Peter Mochrie]] as Detective Snr Sergeant [[List of Water Rats Characters#John \"Knocker\" Harrison|John Harrison]] (22 episodes, 1996)\n* [[Jeremy Callaghan]] as Detective Snr Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Kevin Holloway|Kevin Holloway]] (10 episodes, 1996)\n* Richard Healy as Insp [[List of Water Rats Characters#Tony Brady|Tony Brady]] (14 episodes, 1996\u20131997)\n* Treffyn Koreshoff as [[List of Water Rats Characters#David Goldstein|David Goldstein]] (17 episodes, 1996\u20131999)\n* John Walton as [[List of Water Rats Characters#John Walton|John Walton]] (26 episodes, 1997\u20131999)\n* Anthony Martin as [[List of Water Rats Characters#Colin \"Chopper\" Lewis|Colin \"Chopper\" Lewis]] (44 episodes, 1997\u20132001)\n* [[Mouche Phillips]] as [[List of Water Rats characters#Eva Minton|Eva Minton]] (8 episodes, 2000\u20132001) \n* [[Brooke Satchwell]] as [[List of Water Rats Characters#Sophie Ferguson|Sophie Ferguson]] (20 episodes, 2000\u20132001)\n* Joss McWilliam as Sgt [[List of Water Rats Characters#Lance Rorke|Lance Rorke]] (29 episodes, 2000\u20132001)\n\n==Season summaries==\n\n===Pilot===\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Water Rats: Dead in the Water\n| image          = \n| image size     =\n| caption        = \n| director       = [[Tim Burstall]]\n| producer       = \n| writer         = [[Tony Morphett]]\n| based on = \n| narrator       =\n| starring       =\n| music          = \n| cinematography = \n| editing        = \n| studio = \n| distributor    = \n| released       = 12 February 1996\n| runtime        = 90 mins\n| country        = Australia\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross = \n| preceded by    =\n| followed by    =\n}}\nThe first episode of ''Water Rats'' screened in Australia at 8.30&nbsp;pm on Monday, 12 February 1996.

The [[Television series|series]] was based on work of the men and women of the [[New South Wales Police Force#Marine Area Command|Sydney Water Police]] who fight crime around [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and surrounding locales. The show was set on and around [[Goat Island (Port Jackson)|Goat Island]] in Sydney Harbour.\n\n''Water Rats'' premiered on 12 February 1996, and ran for six seasons and 177 episodes. [[Colin Friels]] and [[Catherine McClements]] were the original stars of the series and were instrumental in the show's early success. They both departed the show in 1999. In later seasons, [[Steve Bisley]], [[Aaron Pedersen]] and [[Dee Smart]] became the show's main stars.\n\nFor the sixth and final season in 2001, the show concentrated more on the cops' personal lives rather than just focusing on the crimes committed. The Nine Network cancelled the show after six seasons. Executive Producer [[Kris Noble]] blamed escalating costs for the cancellation. However, Bisley and Smart had also just quit the show, and the series had already been suffering a ratings battle following the departure of Friels and McClements in 1999.\n\nThe final episode was broadcast in Australia on 7 August 2001.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Water Rats characters}}\n\n* [[Colin Friels]] as Det Snr Constable [[Frank Holloway]] (1996\u20131999)\n* [[Catherine McClements]] as Det Snr Constable [[Rachel Goldstein]] (1996\u20131999)\n* [[Steve Bisley]] as Det Sergeant [[Jack Christey]] (1998\u20132001)\n* [[Jay Laga'aia]] as Snr Const [[Tommy Tavita]] (1996\u20132000)\n* [[Aaron Pedersen]] as Det Constable [[Michael Reilly (character)|Michael Reilly]] (1999\u20132001)\n* [[Dee Smart]] as Det Snr Constable [[Alex St. Clare]] (2000\u20132001)\n\n===Supporting cast===\n* [[Peter Bensley]] as Snr Sgt/Chief Insp [[List of Water Rats Characters#Jeff Hawker|Jeff Hawker]] (1996\u20132001)\n* Bill Young as Chief Insp [[List of Water Rats Characters#Clarke Webb|Clarke Webb]] (1996 only)\n* Brett Partridge as Snr Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Gavin Sykes|Gavin Sykes]] (1996\u20132001)\n* [[Toni Scanlan]] as Snr Sgt [[List of Water Rats Characters#Helen Blakemore|Helen Blakemore]] (1996\u20132001)\n* [[Scott Burgess (actor)|Scott Burgess]] as Snr Sgt [[List of Water Rats Characters#Dave McCall|Dave McCall]] (1996\u20131999)\n* [[Aaron Jeffery]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Terry Watson|Terry Watson]] (1996\u20131998)\n* [[Sophie Heathcote]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Fiona Cassidy|Fiona Cassidy]] (1996\u20131997)\n* [[Raelee Hill]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Tayler Johnson|Tayler Johnson]] (1997\u20131999)\n* [[Allison Cratchley]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Emma Woods|Emma Woods]] (1998\u20132001)\n* [[Diarmid Heidenreich]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Matthew Quinn|Matthew Quinn]] (2000\u20132001)\n* [[Rebecca Smart]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Donna Janevski|Donna Janevski]] (2000\u20132001)\n\n=== Recurring roles ===\n\n* [[Peter Mochrie]] as Detective Snr Sergeant [[List of Water Rats Characters#John \"Knocker\" Harrison|John Harrison]] (22 episodes, 1996)\n* [[Jeremy Callaghan]] as Detective Snr Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Kevin Holloway|Kevin Holloway]] (10 episodes, 1996)\n* Richard Healy as Insp [[List of Water Rats Characters#Tony Brady|Tony Brady]] (14 episodes, 1996\u20131997)\n* Treffyn Koreshoff as [[List of Water Rats Characters#David Goldstein|David Goldstein]] (17 episodes, 1996\u20131999)\n* John Walton as [[List of Water Rats Characters#John Walton|John Walton]] (26 episodes, 1997\u20131999)\n* Anthony Martin as [[List of Water Rats Characters#Colin \"Chopper\" Lewis|Colin \"Chopper\" Lewis]] (44 episodes, 1997\u20132001)\n* [[Mouche Phillips]] as [[List of Water Rats characters#Eva Minton|Eva Minton]] (8 episodes, 2000\u20132001) \n* [[Brooke Satchwell]] as [[List of Water Rats Characters#Sophie Ferguson|Sophie Ferguson]] (20 episodes, 2000\u20132001)\n* Joss McWilliam as Sgt [[List of Water Rats Characters#Lance Rorke|Lance Rorke]] (29 episodes, 2000\u20132001)\n\n==Season summaries==\n\n===Pilot===\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Water Rats: Dead in the Water\n| image          = \n| image size     =\n| caption        = \n| director       = [[Tim Burstall]]\n| producer       = \n| writer         = [[Tony Morphett]]\n| based on = \n| narrator       =\n| starring       =\n| music          = \n| cinematography = \n| editing        = \n| studio = \n| distributor    = \n| released       = 12 February 1996\n| runtime        = 90 mins\n| country        = Australia\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross = \n| preceded by    =\n| followed by    =\n}}\nThe first episode of ''Water Rats'' screened in Australia at 8.30&nbsp;pm on Monday, 12 February 1996.

It contained songs featured on the series, such as \"Goldie's Theme\" by Cathi Ogden (heard in many episodes, most notably episode 109) and \"I'll Dream of You\" by Hugh Wilson (heard in Frank's final episode). It also features a couple of songs sung by cast members: \"Breathe\" with [[Raelee Hill]] and \"Let's Party\" with [[Jay Laga'aia]]. The song \"Breathe\", was written by [[James Freud]] who also sung in the chorus.\n\n==International broadcasting==\nThe series is currently{{when|date=October 2018}} being re-run in:\n\n* {{Flag|Australia}} on [[Foxtel]]'s [[Hallmark Channel (Australia)|Hallmark Channel]]\n* {{Flag|Ireland}} on [[RT\u00c9 One]], Sunday and Monday mornings\n* {{Flag|Denmark}} on Kanal9.
