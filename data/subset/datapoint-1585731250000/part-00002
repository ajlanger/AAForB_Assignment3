{"title_page": "Aquifer thermal energy storage", "text_new": "'''Aquifer thermal energy storage''' (ATES) is the [[Thermal energy storage|storage]] and recovery of [[thermal energy]] in the subsurface. ATES is applied to provide heating and cooling to buildings.\nStorage and recovery of thermal energy is achieved by extraction and injection of [[groundwater]] from [[aquifer]]s using groundwater wells. Systems commonly operate in a seasonal mode. The groundwater that is extracted in summer, is used for cooling by transferring heat from the building to the groundwater by means of a [[heat exchanger]]. Subsequently, the heated groundwater is injected back into the aquifer, which creates a storage of heated groundwater. In wintertime, the flow direction is reversed such that the heated groundwater is extracted and can be used for heating (often in combination with a [[heat pump]]). Therefore, operating an ATES system uses the subsurface as a temporal storage to buffer seasonal variations in heating and cooling demand. When replacing traditional fossil fuel dependent heating and cooling systems, ATES can serve as a cost-effective technology to reduce the primary energy consumption of a building and the associated CO2 emissions.\n\nIn 2009 [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen, Denmark, many countries and regions have made targets for global [[climate protection]]. The European Union also set a target to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]], increase use of [[sustainable energy]] and improve [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. For this target, ATES can actually contribute significantly, as about 40% of [[global energy consumption]] is done by buildings, and is mainly for [[heating]] and [[cooling]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Rosa |first1=Mattia |last2=Bianco |first2=Vincenzo |last3=Scarpa |first3=Federico |last4=Tagliafico |first4=Luca A. |date=2014 |title=Heating and cooling building energy demand evaluation; a simplified model and a modified degree days approach |journal=Applied Energy |volume=128 |pages=217\u2013229 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.04.067}}</ref> Therefore, the development of ATES has been paid a lot of attention and the number of ATES has increased dramatically, especially in Europe.

One well is used for heat storage, and the other for cold storage. During winter, (warm) groundwater is extracted from the heat storage well and injected in the cold storage well. During summer, the flow direction is reversed such that (cold) groundwater is extracted from the cold storage well and injected in the heat storage well. Because each well serves both as an extraction and injection well, these systems are called bi-directional.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dickinson |first1=J.

These systems do not switch pumping direction, such that groundwater is always extracted at the natural aquifer temperature. Although thermal energy is stored in the subsurface, there is usually no intention to retrieve the stored energy.\n\nThermal energy storage can also be achieved by circulating a fluid through a buried [[heat exchanger]], that usually consists of a horizontal or vertical pipeline. As these systems do not extract or inject groundwater, they are called closed systems and are known as borehole thermal energy storage or [[ground source heat pumps]].

Despite the regulations made to prevent the interference between ATES and groundwater contaminants, the possibility of their encounter is however rising, because of the rapid increase of the number of ATES and slow progress of remediation groundwater contaminations in urban area. Among the common groundwater contaminants, chlorinated ethenes have a most chance to interfere with the ATES system, as they are often found at the similar depth as ATES. When chlorinated ethenes present as [[Dense non-aqueous phase liquid]] (DNAPLs), the possible dissolution of DNAPLs by ATES will cause more severe impact on the groundwater quality.<ref>Parker, J.C. and Park, E., 2004.

The combination of ATES and enhanced [[bioremediation]] first introduced in the \u201cMore with SubSurface Energy\u201d (Meer met Bodemenergie, MMB) project in the Netherlands in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meermetbodemenergie.nl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823105924/http://meermetbodemenergie.nl/ |archivedate=2015-08-23 }}</ref> Several scientific and practical rationales are the basics for seeing such combination as a promising possibility.<ref name=\"Ni2015\">Ni, Z. (2015) Bioremediation in aquifer thermal energy storage. Dissertation (in press), Wageningen University.</ref> Increased temperature around the warm well can enhance reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes. Although low temperature in cold well can hamper the biodegradation, the seasonal operation of ATES can transfer contaminant from cold well to hot well for faster biodegradation. Such seasonal groundwater transportation can also homogenize the environmental condition. ATES can be used as a biostimulation too, for example to inject electron donor or microorganism needed for reductive dechlorination. Finally, the life time of ATES (30 years) fits the long duration of in situ bioremediation.\n\n==Societal impacts ==\nThe combination concept of ATES and enhanced natural attenuation (ATES-ENA) can possibly be used in the Netherlands and China, especially in urbanized areas. These areas in both countries are confronted with organic groundwater contaminations. Currently, the combination concept may be better applicable for the Netherlands with more mature technology and application of ATES. And the overlapping between ATES and groundwater contamination also promotes the need of this combined technology. However, for China where ATES is much less developed compared to the Netherlands, the important advantages are that many more demonstration pilot projects can be set-up prior to real applications, and flexible systems can be developed because of the less intense pressure on subsurface use by ATES compared to the Netherlands.<ref name=\"Ni2015\" /> For sustainable urban development, the combined ATES-ENA technology can provide contributions to the solution of both energy and environmental problems.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Aquifers]]\n[[Category:Energy storage]]\n", "text_old": "'''Aquifer thermal energy storage''' (ATES) is the [[Thermal energy storage|storage]] and recovery of [[thermal energy]] in the subsurface.

Despite the regulations made to prevent the interference between ATES and groundwater contaminants, the possibility of their encounter is however rising, because of the rapid increase of the number of ATES and slow progress of remediation groundwater contaminations in urban area. Among the common groundwater contaminants, chlorinated ethenes have a most chance to interfere with the ATES system, as they are often found at the similar depth as ATES. When chlorinated ethenes present as [[Dense non-aqueous phase liquid]] (DNAPLs), the possible dissolution of DNAPLs by ATES will cause more severe impact on the groundwater quality.<ref>Parker, J.C. and Park, E., 2004.

The combination of ATES and enhanced [[bioremediation]] first introduced in the \u201cMore with SubSurface Energy\u201d (Meer met Bodemenergie, MMB) project in the Netherlands in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meermetbodemenergie.nl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823105924/http://meermetbodemenergie.nl/ |archivedate=2015-08-23 }}</ref> Several scientific and practical rationales are the basics for seeing such combination as a promising possibility.<ref name=\"Ni2015\">Ni, Z. (2015) Bioremediation in aquifer thermal energy storage. Dissertation (in press), Wageningen University.</ref> Increased temperature around the warm well can enhance reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes. Although low temperature in cold well can hamper the biodegradation, the seasonal operation of ATES can transfer contaminant from cold well to hot well for faster biodegradation. Such seasonal groundwater transportation can also homogenize the environmental condition. ATES can be used as a biostimulation too, for example to inject electron donor or microorganism needed for reductive dechlorination. Finally, the life time of ATES (30 years) fits the long duration of in situ bioremediation.\n\n==Societal impacts ==\nThe combination concept of ATES and enhanced natural attenuation (ATES-ENA) can possibly be used in the Netherlands and China, especially in urbanized areas. These areas in both countries are confronted with organic groundwater contaminations. Currently, the combination concept may be better applicable for the Netherlands with more mature technology and application of ATES. And the overlapping between ATES and groundwater contamination also promotes the need of this combined technology. However, for China where ATES is much less developed compared to the Netherlands, the important advantages are that many more demonstration pilot projects can be set-up prior to real applications, and flexible systems can be developed because of the less intense pressure on subsurface use by ATES compared to the Netherlands.<ref name=\"Ni2015\" /> For sustainable urban development, the combined ATES-ENA technology can provide contributions to the solution of both energy and environmental problems.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Aquifers]]\n[[Category:Energy storage]]\n", "name_user": "PhBlum", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer_thermal_energy_storage"}
