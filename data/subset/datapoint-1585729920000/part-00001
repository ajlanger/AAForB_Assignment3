He won the [[South American Footballer of the Year]] award in 1987 and 1993, and in 1999, he was also named one of the top 100 players of the 20th century by [[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]].

One of the most recognisable players in the league at the time of its inception, he helped popularise the league during the second half of the 1990s. To this day, he is an icon and is considered one of the most decorated players to ever play in MLS; in 2005, he was named to the [[MLS All-Time Best XI]].<ref name=\"Colombian flavour on the rise\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/live-scores/news/y=2012/m=4/news=colombian-flavour-the-rise-mls-1614638.html|title=Colombian flavour on the rise in MLS|publisher=FIFA.com|date=15 April 2012|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"mlssoccer1\">[http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/03/08/colombians-mls-stability-status-influence-recent-shift Colombians in MLS: Stability, status influence recent shift | MLSsoccer.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/19/mls-colombia-colombians-portland-timbers-diego-chara Why are so many Colombians keen to play in MLS? | Football | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league-soccer/2010/10/19/2172421/colombia-makes-an-impact-on-major-league-soccer Colombia Makes An Impact On Major League Soccer - Goal.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1614638.html</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n===Colombia and Europe===\nBorn in [[Santa Marta]], [[Colombia]], Valderrama began his career at [[Uni\u00f3n Magdalena]] of the Colombian First Division in 1981. He also later played for [[Millonarios]] in 1984. He joined [[Deportivo Cali]] in 1985, where he played most of his Colombian football. In 1988, he moved to the [[Ligue 1|French First Division]] side [[Montpellier H\u00e9rault SC|Montpellier]]. He struggled to adapt to the less technical and the faster, more physical, and tactical brand of football being played in Europe, losing his place in the squad. However, his passing ability later saw him become the club's main creative force, and he played a decisive role as his side won the [[Coupe de France]] in [[1990 Coupe de France Final|1990]]. In 1991, he remained in Europe and joined Spanish side [[Real Valladolid]] for a season. He then returned to Colombia in 1992 and went on to play for [[Independiente Medell\u00edn]], and subsequently [[Atl\u00e9tico Junior]] in 1993, with whom he won the Colombian championship in 1993 and 1995.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"treccani\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===MLS career===\n[[File:Carlos Valderrama 1998.jpg|thumb|200px|Valderrama at a [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] fan meet in 1998]]\nValderrama began his [[Major League Soccer]] career with the US side [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] in the league's inaugural year of 1996, and won its ever first [[Supporters' Shield]] and [[Major League Soccer MVP Award|Most Valuable Player award]], finishing the season with 4 goals and 17 assists. He remained with the club for the 1997 season, and also spent a spell on loan back at Deportivo Cali in Colombia, before moving to another MLS side, [[Miami Fusion]], in 1998, where he also remained for two seasons. He returned to Tampa Bay in 2000, spending two more seasons with the club; while a member of the Mutiny, the team would sell Carlos Valderrama wigs at [[Tampa Stadium]].<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/> In the [[2000 MLS season]], Valderrama recorded the only 20+ assist season in MLS history\u2014ending the season with 26 \u2014 a single season assist record that remains intact to this day, and which MLS itself suggested was an \"unbreakable\" record in a 2012 article.<ref name=unbreakable>[http://www.mlssoccer.com/video/2012/06/22/power-5-unbreakable-records-valderramas-26-assists-2000 Power 5 Unbreakable Records - Valderrama's 26 assists in 2000 | MLSsoccer.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2001, Valderrama joined the [[Colorado Rapids]], and remained with the team until 2002, when he retired; his American soccer league career spanned a total of eight years, during which he made 175 appearances.

In his first major international tournament, he helped Colombia to a third-place finish at the 1987 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Argentina, as his team's captain, where he was named the tournament's best player; during the tournament he scored the opening goal in Colombia's 2\u20130 over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] on 1 July, their first match of the group stage.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"Colombian king\"/>\n\n[[File:Valderrama colombia 1993.jpg|thumb|120px|Valderrama with Colombia in 1993]]\nSome of Valderrama's most impressive international performances came during the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in Italy, during which he served as Colombia's captain. He helped his team to a 2\u20130 win against the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|UAE]] in Colombia's opening match of the group stage, scoring the second goal of the match with a strike from 20 yards. Colombia lost their second match against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], however, needing at least a draw against the eventual champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in their final group match in order to advance to the next round of the competition. In the decisive game, German striker [[Pierre Littbarski]] scored what appeared to be the winning goal in the 88th minute of the game; however, within the last minute of injury time, Valderrama beat several opposing players and made a crucial left-footed pass to [[Freddy Rinc\u00f3n]], who subsequently equalised, sealing a place for Colombia in the second round of the tournament with a 1\u20131 draw.

His impact in the final tournament at the advancing age of 37, however, was less decisive, and, despite defeating [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], Colombia once again suffered a first round exit, following a 2\u20130 defeat against [[England national football team|England]], which was Valderrama's final international appearance.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"Colombian king\"/>\n\n==Playing style==\nAlthough Valderrama is often defined as a 'classic [[Squad number (association football)|number 10]] [[playmaker]]', due to his creativity and offensive contribution, in reality he was not a classic playmaker in the traditional sense. Although he often wore the number 10 shirt throughout his career and was deployed as an attacking midfielder at times, he played mostly in deeper positions in the [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|centre]] of the pitch \u2013 often operating in a free role as a [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker|deep-lying playmaker]], rather than in [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|more advanced midfield positions]] behind the forwards \u2013 in order to have a greater influence on the game.<ref name=\"Colombian king\"/> A team-player, Valderrama was also known to be an extremely selfless [[midfielder]], who preferred assisting his teammates over going for goal himself;<ref name=\"mlssoccer1\"/><ref name=dios>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/columnista0.asp|title=\"El Pibe, un peque\u00f1o dios\"|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|author1=Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez V.|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"The Global Art of Soccer\">{{cite book|last1=Witzig|first1=Richard|title=The Global Art of Soccer|date=2006|publisher=CusiBoy Publishing|location=New Orleans|isbn=9780977668809|page=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&pg=PA166&dq=carlos+valderrama+colombia&hl=it&ei=ZlIeTPGzONiS4gbty6CeDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=carlos%20valderrama%20colombia&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Collie|first1=Ashley Jude|title=World of Soccer: A Complete Guide to the World's Most Popular Sport|date=2005|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0823936988|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bgrsn7ybvNoC&pg=PA63&dq=%22carlos+valderrama%22&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=17#v=onepage&q=%22carlos%20valderrama%22&f=false}}</ref> his tactical intelligence, positioning, efficient movement and versatile range of passing enabled him to both set the tempo of his team in midfield with short, first time exchanges, or create chances with long lobbed passes or through balls.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"Baggio Takes Great Strides Toward Soccer Greatness\"/><ref name=\"Chi ha sbagliato Pagliuca\">[http://chihasbagliatopagliuca.blogspot.com/2012/08/how-maturana-changed-football.html Chi ha sbagliato Pagliuca?: How Maturana changed football<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"youtube1\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoyBzAYFg8E Valderrama 1990/1991 French D1 (assists) part2 - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Diez veces gracias\">{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/col1.asp|title=Diez veces gracias|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|author1=Jaime Bernal|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"I'd do it all again\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/live-scores/news/y=2006/m=2/news=carlos-valderrama-all-again-102983.html|title=Carlos Valderrama: I'd do it all again|publisher=FIFA.com|date=20 February 2006|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nValderrama's most instantly recognisable physical features were his big afro-blonde hairstyle, jewelry, and moustache,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> but he was best known for his grace and elegance on the ball, as well as his agility, and quick feet as a footballer. His control, [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] ability and footwork were similar to those of smaller players, which for a player of Valderrama's size and physical build was fairly uncommon, and he frequently stood out throughout his career for his ability to use his strength, balance, composure, and flamboyant technique to shield the ball from opponents when put under pressure, and retain possession in difficult situations, often with elaborate skills, which made him an extremely popular figure with the fans. Valderrama's mix of physical strength, two-footed ability, unpredictability and flair enabled him to produce key and incisive performances against top tier teams, while his world class vision and exceptional passing and [[Cross (football)|crossing]] ability with his right foot made him one of the best [[Assist (football)|assist]] providers of his time; his height, physique and elevation also made him effective in the air, and he was also an accurate [[Direct free kick|free kick]] taker and striker of the ball, despite not being a particularly prolific goalscorer.<ref name=\"Colombian king\"/><ref name=\"Colombia aren't creative enough\"/><ref name=\"Boots and a bouffant\"/><ref name=\"Baggio Takes Great Strides Toward Soccer Greatness\"/><ref name=\"Colombian flavour on the rise\"/><ref name=\"treccani\">{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlos-valderrama_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)/|title=Valderrama, Carlos|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002)|language=Italian|author1=Matteo Dotto|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=87394/index.html Valderrama: an artist's short spell in Montpellier - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"The Global Art of Soccer\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/news/newsid=2167928/index.html The day Colombia rocked the Monumental - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCpLicqLvOA 1996 Valderrama vs West MLS All star - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"youtube2\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp7vf5So3_k MLS LEGENDS | Carlos \"El Pibe\" Valderrama - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"youtube3\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7A5smuVFs8 Carlos VALDERRAMA keep and pass compilation - christinayan - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/|title=Informe Especial del *Pibe* Valderrama|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/col4.asp|title=El m\u00e1s querido, el inolvidable...|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|author1=C\u00e9sar Mu\u00f1oz|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite his natural talent and ability as a footballer, Valderrama earned a reputation for having a \"languid\" playing style, as well as lacking notable pace, being unfit, and for having a poor defensive work-rate on the pitch, in particular after succumbing to the physical effects of ageing in his later career in the MLS. In his first season in France, he also initially struggled to adapt to the faster-paced, more physical and tactically rigorous European brand of football, which saw him play in an unfamiliar position, and gave him less space and time on the ball to dictate attacking passing moves; he was criticised at times for his lack of match fitness and his low defensive contribution, which initially limited his appearances with the club, although he later successfully became a key creative player in his team's starting line-up due to his discipline, skill, and his precise and efficient passing.<ref name=\"Colombian king\"/><ref name=\"treccani\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=dios/><ref name=\"Diez veces gracias\"/><ref name=\"I'd do it all again\"/> Despite these claims, earlier in his career, however, Valderrama demonstrated substantial pace, stamina, and defensive competence.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/><ref name=\"prestigio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/2008/07/21/C-115-no-tengo-miedo-a-perder-el-prestigio.php|title=\"No tengo miedo a perder el prestigio\"|publisher=El Gr\u00e1fico|language=Spanish|author1=Diego Borinsky|date=21 July 2008|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nFormer French defender [[Laurent Blanc]], who played with Valderrama in Montpellier, voiced one of the most accurate descriptions for Valderrama, \"In the fast and furious European game he wasn't always at his ease.

He also later played for [[Millonarios]] in 1984. He joined [[Deportivo Cali]] in 1985, where he played most of his Colombian football. In 1988, he moved to the [[Ligue 1|French First Division]] side [[Montpellier H\u00e9rault SC|Montpellier]]. He struggled to adapt to the less technical and the faster, more physical, and tactical brand of football being played in Europe, losing his place in the squad. However, his passing ability later saw him become the club's main creative force, and he played a decisive role as his side won the [[Coupe de France]] in [[1990 Coupe de France Final|1990]]. In 1991, he remained in Europe and joined Spanish side [[Real Valladolid]] for a season. He then returned to Colombia in 1992 and went on to play for [[Independiente Medell\u00edn]], and subsequently [[Atl\u00e9tico Junior]] in 1993, with whom he won the Colombian championship in 1993 and 1995.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"treccani\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===MLS career===\n[[File:Carlos Valderrama 1998.jpg|thumb|200px|Valderrama at a [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] fan meet in 1998]]\nValderrama began his [[Major League Soccer]] career with the US side [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] in the league's inaugural year of 1996, and won its ever first [[Supporters' Shield]] and [[Major League Soccer MVP Award|Most Valuable Player award]], finishing the season with 4 goals and 17 assists. He remained with the club for the 1997 season, and also spent a spell on loan back at Deportivo Cali in Colombia, before moving to another MLS side, [[Miami Fusion]], in 1998, where he also remained for two seasons.

In his first major international tournament, he helped Colombia to a third-place finish at the 1987 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Argentina, as his team's captain, where he was named the tournament's best player; during the tournament he scored the opening goal in Colombia's 2\u20130 over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] on 1 July, their first match of the group stage.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"Colombian king\"/>\n\n[[File:Valderrama colombia 1993.jpg|thumb|120px|Valderrama with Colombia in 1993]]\nSome of Valderrama's most impressive international performances came during the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in Italy, during which he served as Colombia's captain. He helped his team to a 2\u20130 win against the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|UAE]] in Colombia's opening match of the group stage, scoring the second goal of the match with a strike from 20 yards. Colombia lost their second match against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], however, needing at least a draw against the eventual champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in their final group match in order to advance to the next round of the competition. In the decisive game, German striker [[Pierre Littbarski]] scored what appeared to be the winning goal in the 88th minute of the game; however, within the last minute of injury time, Valderrama beat several opposing players and made a crucial left-footed pass to [[Freddy Rinc\u00f3n]], who subsequently equalised, sealing a place for Colombia in the second round of the tournament with a 1\u20131 draw.

His impact in the final tournament at the advancing age of 37, however, was less decisive, and, despite defeating [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], Colombia once again suffered a first round exit, following a 2\u20130 defeat against [[England national football team|England]], which was Valderrama's final international appearance.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"Colombian king\"/>\n\n==Playing style==\nAlthough Valderrama is often defined as a 'classic [[Squad number (association football)|number 10]] [[playmaker]]', due to his creativity and offensive contribution, in reality he was not a classic playmaker in the traditional sense.

His control, [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] ability and footwork were similar to those of smaller players, which for a player of Valderrama's size and physical build was fairly uncommon, and he frequently stood out throughout his career for his ability to use his strength, balance, composure, and flamboyant technique to shield the ball from opponents when put under pressure, and retain possession in difficult situations, often with elaborate skills, which made him an extremely popular figure with the fans. Valderrama's mix of physical strength, two-footed ability, unpredictability and flair enabled him to produce key and incisive performances against top tier teams, while his world class vision and exceptional passing and [[Cross (football)|crossing]] ability with his right foot made him one of the best [[Assist (football)|assist]] providers of his time; his height, physique and elevation also made him effective in the air, and he was also an accurate [[Direct free kick|free kick]] taker and striker of the ball, despite not being a particularly prolific goalscorer.<ref name=\"Colombian king\"/><ref name=\"Colombia aren't creative enough\"/><ref name=\"Boots and a bouffant\"/><ref name=\"Baggio Takes Great Strides Toward Soccer Greatness\"/><ref name=\"Colombian flavour on the rise\"/><ref name=\"treccani\">{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlos-valderrama_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)/|title=Valderrama, Carlos|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002)|language=Italian|author1=Matteo Dotto|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=87394/index.html Valderrama: an artist's short spell in Montpellier - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"The Global Art of Soccer\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/news/newsid=2167928/index.html The day Colombia rocked the Monumental - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCpLicqLvOA 1996 Valderrama vs West MLS All star - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"youtube2\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp7vf5So3_k MLS LEGENDS | Carlos \"El Pibe\" Valderrama - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"youtube3\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7A5smuVFs8 Carlos VALDERRAMA keep and pass compilation - christinayan - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/|title=Informe Especial del *Pibe* Valderrama|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/col4.asp|title=El m\u00e1s querido, el inolvidable...|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|author1=C\u00e9sar Mu\u00f1oz|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite his natural talent and ability as a footballer, Valderrama earned a reputation for having a \"languid\" playing style, as well as lacking notable pace, being unfit, and for having a poor defensive work-rate on the pitch, in particular after succumbing to the physical effects of ageing in his later career in the MLS. In his first season in France, he also initially struggled to adapt to the faster-paced, more physical and tactically rigorous European brand of football, which saw him play in an unfamiliar position, and gave him less space and time on the ball to dictate attacking passing moves; he was criticised at times for his lack of match fitness and his low defensive contribution, which initially limited his appearances with the club, although he later successfully became a key creative player in his team's starting line-up due to his discipline, skill, and his precise and efficient passing.<ref name=\"Colombian king\"/><ref name=\"treccani\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=dios/><ref name=\"Diez veces gracias\"/><ref name=\"I'd do it all again\"/> Despite these claims, earlier in his career, however, Valderrama demonstrated substantial pace, stamina, and defensive competence.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/><ref name=\"prestigio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/2008/07/21/C-115-no-tengo-miedo-a-perder-el-prestigio.php|title=\"No tengo miedo a perder el prestigio\"|publisher=El Gr\u00e1fico|language=Spanish|author1=Diego Borinsky|date=21 July 2008|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nFormer French defender [[Laurent Blanc]], who played with Valderrama in Montpellier, voiced one of the most accurate descriptions for Valderrama, \"In the fast and furious European game he wasn't always at his ease.
