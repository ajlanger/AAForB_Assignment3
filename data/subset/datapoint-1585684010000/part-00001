{"title_page": "Philip Francis (translator)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n'''Philip Francis''' (19 July 1708 \u2013 5 March 1773) was an Anglo-Irish clergyman and writer, now remembered as a translator of [[Horace]].\n\n==Life==\nHe was son of Dr. John Francis, rector of St. Mary's, Dublin (from which living he was for a time ejected for political reasons), and dean of Lismore, and was born in 1708. He was sent to [[Trinity College, Dublin]], taking the degree of B.A. in 1728, and was ordained, according to his father's wish, in the [[Church of Ireland]]. He held for some time the curacy of St. Peter's parish, Dublin, and while resident in that city published his translation of Horace, besides writing in the interests of \u2018the Castle.\u2019\n\nSoon after the death of his wife, Elizabeth Rowe, whom he married in 1739, he crossed to England, and in 1744 obtained the rectory of [[Skeyton]] in [[Norfolk]]. He shortly was residing for the sake of literature and society in London. In January 1752, when [[Edward Gibbon]] became an inmate of his house, Francis was keeping or supposed to be keeping a school at [[Esher]]; but the boys' friends quickly found that the nominal instructor preferred the pleasures of London to the instruction of his pupils and in a month or two Gibbon was removed. To maintain himself in the social life of London, Francis tried many expedients, but most of them were failures. Two plays of his were produced on the stage, each time without success. He tried translation, but, except in his rendering of the works of Horace, he was sidelined by other writers.\n\nHis fortune was made when he secured, through the kindness of Miss Bellamy, who recommended him, the post of private chaplain to Lady Caroline Fox, and lived in her family, where he taught Lady Sarah Lennox to declaim and [[Charles James Fox]] to read. At the end of 1757 Fox was sent to Eton, and Francis accompanied him to assist the boy in his studies. The father, [[Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland|Henry Fox]] found Francis a useful ally. It has sometimes been said that he was the chief writer in the paper called \u2018The Con-test,\u2019 which lived from November 1756 to August 1757, but the accuracy of this statement is doubted. He is also said to have contributed to the \u2018Gazette\u2019 daily newspaper on behalf of the court interest.\n\nWhen [[William Pitt the Elder]] resigned, in 1761, Francis wrote a libel against him under the title of \u2018Mr. Pitt's Letter Versified,\u2019 the notes to which, according to [[Horace Walpole]], were supplied by Henry Fox (now Lord Holland), and he followed this with \u2018A Letter from the Anonymous Author of \u201cMr. Pitt's Letter Versified,\u201d\u2019 in which he reflected on Pitt's indifference to the truculent language of Colonel [[Isaac Barr\u00e9]]. In 1764 he attacked Pitt and [[John Wilkes]] with great bitterness in the \u2018Political Theatre.\u2019\n\nOn 22 June 1761 he was inducted to the vicarage of [[Chilham]] in Kent, but resigned in the summer of 1762, and through Lord Holland's influence he held from May 1764 to 1768 the chaplaincy at [[Chelsea Hospital]], and the rectory of [[Barrow, Suffolk]], to which he was instituted on 26 February 1762, and which he retained until his death. He was also recommended in January 1764 by [[George Grenville]] for a crown pension. Francis was still unsatisfied. He quarrelled with Lord Holland because he had not been made an Irish bishop, and threatened to expose his patron's villainy.\n\nIn June 1771 he was seized by a paralytic stroke, and after lingering for some years died at Bath 5 March 1773. He was fond of his son [[Philip Francis (politician)|Sir Philip Francis]], and numerous letters to and from him are in the son's memoir; he resented his son's marriage, but they were later reconciled.\n\n==Works==\nOf his rendering of Horace, [[Samuel Johnson]] said: \u2018The lyrical part of Horace never can be perfectly translated. Francis has done it the best. I'll take his five out of six against them all.\u2019 The first part, consisting of the \u2018Odes, Epodes, and Carmen Seculare of Horace in Latin and English,\u2019 in which he was assisted by [[William Dunkin]], was issued at Dublin in two volumes in 1742. It was republished in London in the next year, and in 1746 two more volumes, containing the \u2018Satires, Epistles, and Art of Poetry,\u2019 appeared with a dedication in prose to Robert Jocelyn, lord chancellor of Ireland. The whole version was reissued in 1747, and it ran into many subsequent editions, that edited by [[Edward Dubois (wit)|Edward Dubois]] being the best. It was also included in the set of poets edited by [[Alexander Chalmers]], the \u2018British Poets,\u2019 vols. xcvii\u2013viii., and in [[Charles Whittingham]]'s \u2018Greek and Roman Poets,\u2019 vol. xii.\n\nFrancis worked in 1751 on his play of \u2018Eugenia,\u2019 an adaptation of the French tragedy of \u2018Cenie,\u2019 and it was acted at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] on 17 February 1752, but was unsuccessful; Lord Chesterfield attributed its failure to the fact that pit and gallery did not like a tragedy without bloodshed. A similar failure attended his play of \u2018Constantine,\u2019 which was produced at [[Covent Garden]] on 23 February 1754, and expired on the fourth night. Genest styles it \u2018a cold and uninteresting play, the plot avowedly taken in part from a French piece.\u2019 Both pieces were printed, the former being dedicated to the Countess of Lincoln, and the latter to Lord Chesterfield.\n\nFor eight years he was employed in studying the \u2018Orations\u2019 of [[Demosthenes]], and his translation appeared in two volumes in 1757\u20138, but it was thought inferior to that by [[Thomas Leland]].\n\nAn anonymous volume by [[John Taylor (English publisher)|John Taylor]] was printed in 1813 with the title of ''A Discovery of the Author of the \u201cLetters of Junius,\u201d founded on Evidence and Illustrations.'' It attributed the authorship of the ''[[Letters of Junius]]'' to Francis and his son, Sir Philip Francis, and claimed that all the peculiarities of language in the writings of the elder Francis are discernible in some parts of Junius. Contemporary scholarly consensus is that the son was the author.\n\n==References==\n*{{DNB|wstitle= Francis, Philip (1708?-1773)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Francis, Philip}}\n[[Category:1708 births]]\n[[Category:1773 deaths]]\n[[Category:Church of Ireland priests]]\n[[Category:Irish translators]]\n[[Category:Latin\u2013English translators]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n'''Philip Francis''' (19 July 1708 \u2013 5 March 1773) was an Anglo-Irish clergyman and writer, now remembered as a translator of [[Horace]].\n\n==Life==\nHe was son of Dr. John Francis, rector of St. Mary's, Dublin (from which living he was for a time ejected for political reasons), and dean of Lismore, and was born about 1708.
