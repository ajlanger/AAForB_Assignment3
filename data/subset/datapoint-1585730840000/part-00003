Its final draft was completed by the Constitutional Commission on October 12, 1986 and was ratified by a [[1987 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|nationwide plebiscite]] on February 2, 1987.\n\nThree other constitutions have effectively governed the country in its history: the 1935 Commonwealth Constitution, the 1973 Constitution, and the 1986 Freedom Constitution.\n[[File:Gold_In-Laid_Chest_(Repository_of_1935_Constitution).jpg|thumb|1935 Constitution and its tabernacle displayed at [[Quezon Memorial Circle]], [[Quezon City]]]]\nThe earliest constitution establishing a \"Philippine Republic\", the 1899 [[Malolos Constitution]], was never fully implemented throughout the Philippines and did not establish a state that was internationally recognized, due in great part to the eruption of the [[Philippine\u2013American War]] following its adoption.\n\n==Background of the 1987 Constitution==\n{{main|Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986}}\nRuling by decree during the early months of her tenure as a president installed via the [[People Power Revolution]], President [[Corazon Aquino]] was granted three options: restore to 1935 Constitution, retain and make reforms to the 1973 Constitution, or pass a new constitution. She decided to draft a new constitution and issued Proclamation No. 3 on March 25, 1986, abrogating many of the provisions of th 1973 Constitution adopted during the Marcos regime, including the [[unicameral legislature]] (the [[Batasang Pambansa]]), the office of [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]], and provisions which gave the President legislative powers. Often called the \"Freedom Constitution\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chanrobles.com/aquinoproclamationo3.htm#.XeZXRXduLIU|title=1986 PROVISIONAL (FREEDOM) CONSTITUTION OF THE PHILIPPINES - CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|website=chanrobles.com|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> this constitution was intended as a transitional constitution to ensure democracy and the freedom of the people. The Freedom Constitution provided for an orderly transfer of power while a [[Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986|Constitutional Commission]] was drafting a permanent constitution.\n\nThe Constitutional Commission was composed of forty-eight members appointed by Aquino from varied backgrounds, including several former members of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], former justices of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], a Roman Catholic bishop, and political activists against the Marcos regime. The Commission elected [[Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz-Palma]], a former Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], as its president. Several issues were of particular contention during the Commission's sessions, including the form of government to adopt, the abolition of the death penalty, the retention of U.S. bases in [[Clark Air Base|Clark]] and [[Subic Bay Naval Base|Subic]], and the integration of economic policies into the constitution. [[Lino Brocka]], a film director and political activist who was a member of the Commission, walked out before the constitution's completion, and two other delegates dissented from the final draft. The Commission finished the final draft on October 12, 1986 and presented it to Aquino on October 15. The constitution was ratified by a [[1987 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|nationwide plebiscite on February 8, 1987]].\n\nThe constitution provided for three governmental powers, namely the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]], and [[Judiciary|judicial branches]]. The executive branch is headed by the president and his appointed cabinet members. The executive, same with the other two co-equal branches, has limited power. This is to ensure that the country will be \"safeguarded\" if martial law is to be declared. The president can still declare martial law, but it expires within 60 days and Congress can either reject or extend it.\n\nThe task of the Supreme Court is to review whether a declaration of martial law is just. The legislative power consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. There are twenty-four senators and the House is composed of district representatives. It also created opportunities for under-represented sectors of community to select their representative through party-list system. The judiciary branch comprises the Supreme Court and the lower courts. The Supreme Court is granted the power to hear any cases that deals with the constitutionality of law, about a treaty or decree of the government. It is also tasked to administrate the function of the lower courts.\n\nThrough the constitution, three independent Constitutional Commissions, namely the Civil Service Commission, Commission on Elections, and Commission on Audit, were created. These Constitutional Commissions have different functions. The constitution also paved a way for the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman, which has a function of promoting and ensuring an ethical and lawful conduct of the government.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Readings in Philippine History|last=Candelaria and Alphora|first=Jhon Lee and Veronica|publisher=Rex Book Store, Inc.|year=2018|isbn=978-971-23-8665-7|location=Recto Avenue, Manila, Philippines|pages=71\u201382}}</ref>\n\n== Attempts to amend or change the 1987 Constitution ==\nThere are three possible methods by which the [[Constitution]] can be amended: a [[Constituent assembly|Constituent Assembly]] (Con-Ass), [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] (Con-Con), or [[People's Initiative]]. All three methods require [[ratification]] by majority vote in a national [[referendum]].

A constitution was drafted by then-Secretary of [[National Security Council (Philippines)|National Security Council]] [[Jose T. Almonte|Jose Almonte]], but was never completed because it was exposed to the media by different non-government organizations. They saw through a potential change regarding the protection of the people's interests in the constitutional draft.\n\nIn 1997, the Pedrosa couple created a group called PIRMA followed with an attempt to change the constitution through a People's Initiative by way of gathering signatures from voters. Many prominent figures opposed the proposition, including Senator [[Miriam Defensor Santiago|Miriam Defensor-Santiago]], who brought the issue all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] and eventually won the case. The Supreme Court ruled that the initiative not continue, stating that a People's Initiative requires an enabling law for it to push through.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1997/mar1997/gr_127325_1997.html|title=G.R.

The attempt never attained its purpose after various entities opposed it due apparently to the attempt serving the personal interests of the initiators.\n\nAfter the Estrada presidency, the administration of [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] endorsed constitutional changes via a Constitutional Assembly, with then-House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia Jr.|Jose de Venecia]] leading the way. However, due to political controversies surrounding Arroyo's administration, including the possibility of term extension, the proposal was shut down.\n\nThe next attempt was from then-Speaker of the House [[Feliciano Belmonte Jr.|Feliciano Belmonte Jr]]. during President [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s administration. Belmonte attempted to introduce amendments to the Constitution focusing on economic provisions aiming toward liberalization. The effort did not succeeded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iper.org.ph/documentation/Chap%2001.pdf|title=Changing the constitution|website=IPER|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Rodrigo Duterte|Rodrigo Roa Duterte]] oversaw the possibility of implementing federalism on the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/124985-duterte-federalism-regions-income|title=Duterte: Federalism allows regions to keep most of their income|last=Ranada|first=Pia|website=Rappler|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> Following his ascension as president after the [[2016 Philippine presidential election|2016 presidential election]], he signed  [[Philippine Executive Order 10|Executive Order No. 10]] on December 7, 2016, creating the Consultative Committee to Review the 1987 Constitution.\n\n== Structure and contents<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/|title=Structure of the 1987 Constitution|website=www.officialgazette.gov.ph}}</ref> ==\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1987)}}\n\nThe preamble and eighteen self-contained articles with a section numbering that resets for every article.\n\n=== Preamble ===\n\nThe preamble introduces the constitution and the source of sovereignty, the people.

It enumerates two kinds of citizens: natural-born citizens and naturalized citizens. Natural-born citizens are those who are citizens from birth without having to perform any act to acquire or perfect Philippine citizenship. The Philippines follows a ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' system where citizenship is mainly acquired through a blood relationship with Filipino citizens.\n\nNatural-born citizenship forms an important part of the political system as only [[Philippine nationality law|natural-born Filipinos]] are eligible to hold high offices, including all elective offices beginning with a representative in the House of Representatives up to the President.\n\n===Article V \u2013 Suffrage===\nArticle V mandates various age and residence qualifications to vote and a system of secret ballots and absentee voting.

This section also provides important provisions such as:\n\n* Promote effective industrialization and aim for a full employment of its people\n* All natural resources within the Philippine territory shall be owned by the State\n* Protect the rights of the indigenous cultural communities\n* Businesses, organizations and other institutions shall be subject to the intervention of the State\n\n===Article XIII \u2013 Social Justice and Human Rights===\nArticle XIII divulge the utmost responsibility of the Congress to give the highest priority in enactments of such measures which protects and enhances the rights of all the people to human dignity through affirming that present social, economic and political inequalities as well as cultural inequities among the elites and the poor shall be reduced or removed in order to secure equitable welfare and common good among Filipino people.

Moreover, this section also lays down salient provisions such as:\n\n* Protection of labor, be it local or overseas in order to promote full employment and equal opportunities for all.\n* Protection of the rights  and giving of support to independent Filipino farmers and fishermen among local communities for the utilization of their resources without foreign intrusion, together with the provision and application of Agrarian and Natural Resources Reform for the development of the lives of the people.\n* Securing of the lives among the underprivileged citizens through Urban Land Reforms and Housing.\n* Adoption and integration of affordable and competent medical care and health services for the welfare of every Filipino people.\n* Recognition of the rights of women in workplace for the realization of their full potential in providing service to its nation.\n* Recognition of the role and the rights of people's organizations.\n\n===Article XIV \u2013 Education, Science and Technology, Arts, Culture and Sports===\n{{Empty section|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Article XV \u2013 The Family===\nArticle XV establishes the recognition of the state on the Filipino family as the basic foundation of the nation as it shall reinforce and bolster its solidarity and steadily promote its development. Alongside with this, it also states important provisions such as:\n\n* Protection of marriage by the state as it is recognized as the foundation of the family and is an inviolable institution.\n* Provision of policies and programs subject to every Filipino family assuring the people's welfare and social security.\n* Protection of the rights of spouses with responsible parenthood to found a family in accordance with their religious convictions.\n* Recognition and protection of the rights of every Filipino children.\n\n===Article XVI \u2013 General Provisions===\n{{Empty section|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Article XVII \u2013 Amendments or Revisions===\n\nArticle XVII establishes the methods by which the Constitution may be amended or revised. Amendments may be proposed by either: a) a three-fourths vote of all Members of Congress (called a [[Constituent Assembly (Philippines)|Constituent Assembly]]), b) a [[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Constitutional Convention]], or c) a petition of at least twelve percent of all registered voters, and at least three percent of registered voters within each district (called a [[People's Initiative]]). All amendments must be ratified in a national [[referendum]].\n\n===Article XVIII \u2013 Transitory Provisions===\n\nThe Constitution also contains several other provisions enumerating various state policies including, i.e., the affirmation of [[Labor (economics)|labor]] \"as a primary social economic force\" (Section 14, Article II); the equal protection of \"the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception\" (Section 12, Article II); the \"Filipino family as the foundation of the nation\" (Article XV, Section 1); the recognition of [[Filipino language|Filipino]] as \"the national language of the Philippines\" (Section 6, Article XIV), and even a requirement that \"all educational institutions shall undertake regular sports activities throughout the country in cooperation with athletic clubs and other sectors.\" (Section 19.1, Article XIV) Whether these provisions may, by themselves, be the source of enforceable rights without accompanying legislation has been the subject of considerable debate in the legal sphere and within the Supreme Court. The Court, for example, has ruled that a provision requiring that the State \"guarantee equal access to opportunities to public service\" could not be enforced without accompanying legislation, and thus could not bar the disallowance of so-called \"nuisance candidates\" in presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2004/apr2004/161872.htm\n|title=Pamatong vs. Comelec (G.R.

On March 24, 1934, the United States passed the [[Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act]] that allowed the nation to have self-government through a ten-year transitional period in preparation for full independence. The United States recognized Philippine independence in the [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Treaty of Manila]] on July 4, 1946.</ref> and therefore was under the jurisdiction of the [[Federal Government of the United States]]. Two acts of the United States Congress passed during this period can be considered Philippine constitutions in that those acts defined the fundamental political principles and established the structure, procedures, powers and duties of the Philippine government.\n\n====Philippine Organic Act of 1902====\nThe [[Philippine Organic Act (1902)|Philippine Organic Act of 1902]], sometimes known as the \"Philippine Bill of 1902\" or the \"Cooper Act\", was the first [[organic law]] for the Philippine Islands enacted by the United States Congress. It provided for the creation of a popularly elected [[Philippine Assembly]], and specified that legislative power would be vested in a bicameral legislature composed of the [[Taft Commission|Philippine Commission]] (upper house) and the Philippine Assembly (lower house). Its key provisions included a [[bill of rights]] for the Filipinos and the appointment of two non-voting Filipino [[Resident Commissioner of the Philippines]] to represent the Philippines in the [[United States House of Representatives]].\n\n====Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916====\nThe [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916]], sometimes known as the \"Jones Law\", modified the structure of the Philippine government by removing the Philippine Commission as the legislative upper house and replacing it with a [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] elected by Filipino voters, creating the Philippines' first fully elected national legislature. This act also explicitly stated that it was and always had been the purpose of the people of the United States to renounce their sovereignty over the Philippine Islands and to recognize Philippine independence as soon as a stable government can be established therein.\n\n====Hare\u2013Hawes\u2013Cutting Act (1932)====\n\nThough not a constitution itself, the [[Hare\u2013Hawes\u2013Cutting Act]] of 1932 was the precursor the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act, which laid down the promise of independence to the Philippines after 10 years of transition period and other provisions; however, because of infighting within the Philippine Congress, it was not ratified and only became the basis for the creation of the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act.\n\n====Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act (1934)====\nThough also not a constitution itself, the [[Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act]] of 1934 provided for autonomy and defined mechanisms for the establishment of a formal constitution via a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]].\n{{anchor|1935 constitution}}\n\n=== The 1935 Constitution ===\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1935)}}\nThe 1935 Constitution was written, approved and adopted in 1934 by the Commonwealth of the Philippines (1935\u20131946) and later used by the Third Republic (1946\u20131972). It was written with an eye to meeting the approval of the [[United States Government]] as well, so as to ensure that the U.S. would live up to its promise to grant the Philippines independence and not have a premise to hold onto its possession on the grounds that it was too politically immature and hence unready for full, real independence. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe Commonwealth Constitution was ratified to prepare the country for its independence. This constitution was dominantly influenced by the Americans, but possess the traces of the Malolos Constitution, the German, Spanish, and Mexican Constitution, constitutions of several South American countries, and the unwritten English Constitution.\n\nIt originally provided for a unicameral legislature composed of a president and vice president elected for a six-year term without re-election. It was amended in 1940 to provide for a bicameral legislature composed of a Senate and a House of Representatives. The President is to be elected to a four-year term, together with the Vice-President, with one re-election; the right of suffrage for male citizens of the Philippines who are twenty-one years of age or over and are able to read and write were protected; this protection, later on, extended to the right of suffrage for women two years after the adoption of the constitution.\n\nThe draft of the constitution was approved by the convention on February 8, 1935 and was ratified by President Roosevelt in Washington D.C. on March 25, 1935. Elections were held on September 16, 1935 and Manuel L. Quezon was elected as the first President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.\n\nThe Preamble reads:\n\n:{{cquote|\"The Filipino people, imploring the aid of Divine Providence, in order to establish a government that shall embody their ideals, conserve and develop the patrimony of the nation, promote the general welfare, and secure to themselves and their posterity the blessings of independence under a regime of justice, liberty, and democracy, do ordain and promulgate this Constitution.\"}}\n\nThe original 1935 Constitution provided for a unicameral National Assembly, and the President was elected to a six-year term without the possibility re-election. It was [[Constitutional amendment|amended]] in 1940 to have a bicameral Congress composed of a Senate and House of Representatives, as well the creation of an independent [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|electoral commission]] and to grant the President a four-year term with a maximum of two consecutive terms in office.\n\nA [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] was held in 1971 to rewrite the 1935 Constitution. The convention was stained with manifest bribery and corruption. Possibly the most controversial issue was removing the presidential term limit so that [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos]] could seek re-election for a third term, which many felt was the true reason for which the convention was called. In any case, the 1935 Constitution was suspended in 1972 with Marcos' proclamation of [[martial law]], the rampant corruption of the constitutional process providing him with one of his major premises for doing so. \n{{anchor|1943 constitution}}\n\n=== The 1943 Constitution ===\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1943)}}\n[[File:Laurel addresses National Assembly to approve 1943 Constitution.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel, President of the Second Philippine Republic, addresses the National Assembly in what is now the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Legislative Building]] to approve the 1943 Constitution.]]\nThe 1943 Constitution was drafted by a committee appointed by the [[Philippine Executive Commission]], the body established by the Japanese to administer the Philippines in lieu of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] which had established a [[government-in-exile]]. In mid-1942, Japanese Premier [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]] promised the Filipinos \"the honor of independence\" which meant that the commission would be supplanted by a formal republic.\n\nThe [[Preparatory Committee for Philippine Independence]] tasked with drafting a new constitution was composed, in large part, of members of the prewar National Assembly and of individuals with experience as delegates to the convention that had drafted the 1935 Constitution. Their draft for the republic to be established under the Japanese occupation, however, would be limited in duration, provide for indirect, instead of direct, legislative elections, and an even stronger executive branch.\n\nUpon the approval of the draft by the Committee, the new charter was ratified in 1943 by an assembly of appointed, provincial representatives of the [[Kalibapi]], the organization established by the Japanese to supplant all previous political parties. Upon the ratification by the Kalibapi assembly, the Second Republic was formally proclaimed (1943\u20131945). [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] was elected President by the National Assembly and sworn into office on October 14, 1943. Laurel was highly regarded by the Japanese for having openly criticized the U.S. for the way that they governed the Philippines and because he had a degree from the [[Tokyo International University]].\n\nThe 1943 Constitution remained in force in Japanese-controlled areas of the Philippines, but was never recognized as legitimate or binding by the governments of the United States, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, or the guerrilla organizations loyal to them. In late 1944, President Laurel declared war on the United States and the [[British Empire]] and proclaimed [[martial law]], essentially ruling by decree. His government, in turn, went into exile in December 1944, first to [[Taiwan]] and then Japan. After the announcement of Japan's surrender, Laurel formally dissolved the Second Republic.\n\nThe Preamble reads:\n\n:{{cquote|\"The Filipino people, imploring the aid of Divine Providence and desiring to lead a free national existence, do hereby proclaim their independence, and in order to establish a government that shall promote the general welfare, conserve and develop the patrimony of the Nation, and contribute to the creation of a world order based on peace, liberty, and moral justice, do ordain this Constitution.\"}}\n\nThe 1943 Constitution provided for strong executive powers. The Legislature consisted of a [[unicameral]] National Assembly and only those considered to be anti-US could stand for election, although in practice most legislators were appointed rather than elected.\n{{anchor|1973 constitution}}\n\nUntil the 1960s, the Second Republic and its officers were not viewed as a legitimate Philippine government or as having any standing with the exception of the Second Republic-era Supreme Court, whose decisions, limited to reviews of criminal and commercial cases as part of a policy of discretion by Chief Justice [[Jos\u00e9 Yulo]], continued to be part of official records. This was made easier by the Commonwealth government-in-exile never constituting a Supreme Court, and the formal vacancy in the position of Chief Justice for the Commonwealth with the execution of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]] by the Japanese. It was only during the Macapagal administration that a partial political rehabilitation of the Japanese-era republic took place, with the official recognition of Laurel as a former president and the addition of his cabinet and other officials to the roster of past government officials. However, the 1943 Constitution was not taught in schools, and the laws of the 1943\u201344 National Assembly were never recognized as valid or relevant.\n\n=== The 1973 Constitution ===\n{{see also|Ratification Cases}}\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1973)}}\nThe 1973 Constitution, promulgated after Marcos' [[Proclamation No. 1081|declaration of martial law]], was supposed to introduce a [[Parliamentary government|parliamentary-style government]]. Legislative power was vested in a [[unicameral]] National Assembly whose members were elected for six-year terms. The President was ideally elected as the symbolic and purely [[Figurehead|ceremonial]] [[head of state]] chosen from amongst the Members of the National Assembly for a six-year term and could be re-elected to an unlimited number of terms. Upon election, the President ceased to be a Member of the National Assembly. During his term, the President was not allowed to be a member of a [[political party]] or hold any other office.\n\nExecutive power was meant to be exercised by the [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] who was also elected from among the sitting Assemblymen. The Prime Minister was to be the [[head of government]] and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Armed Forces]]. This constitution was subsequently amended four times (arguably five, depending on how one considers Proclamation No. 3 of 1986, see below).\n\nFrom 16\u201317 October 1976, a majority of [[barangay]] voters (also called \"Citizens' Assemblies\") approved that [[martial law]] should be continued and ratified the amendments to the Constitution proposed by President Marcos.{{refn|In Sanidad vs. Comelec, L-44640, October 12, 1976 the Supreme Court ruled that on the basis of absolute necessity both the constituent power (the power to formulate a Constitution or to propose amendments or revision to the Constitution and to ratify such proposal, which is exclusively vested to the National Assembly, the Constitutional Convention, and the electorate) and legislative powers of the legislature may be exercised by the Chief Executive.<ref>[http://berneguerrero.com/node/90 Summary: Sanidad vs. Commission on Elections (GR L-44640, 12 October 1976)], [http://berneguerrero.com/ berneguerrero.com].</ref><ref>[http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1976/oct1976/gr_44640_1976.html G.R. No. L-44640 October 12, 1976], [http://www.lawphil.net lawphil.net].</ref>}}\n\nThe 1976 amendments provided:\n* for an [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] (IBP) substituting for the Interim National Assembly;\n* that the President would become Prime Minister and continue to exercise legislative powers until such time as martial law was lifted.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment authorized the President to legislate on his own on an \"emergency\" basis:\n\n<blockquote>Whenever in the judgement of the President there exists a grave emergency or a threat or imminence thereof, or whenever the Interim Batasang Pambansa or the regular National Assembly fails or is unable to act adequately on any matter for any reason that in his judgment requires immediate action, he may, in order to meet the exigency, issue the necessary decrees, orders or letters of instructions, which shall form part of the law of the land.</blockquote>\n\nThe 1973 Constitution was further amended in 1980 and 1981. In the 1980 amendment, the retirement age of the members of the judiciary was extended to 70 years. In the 1981 amendments, the false parliamentary system was formally modified into a [[Cabinet of France|French]]-style [[semi-presidential system]] and provided:\n* that executive power was restored to the President;\n* that direct election of the President was restored;\n* for an Executive Committee composed of the Prime Minister and not more than 14 members was created to \"assist the President in the exercise of his powers and functions and in the performance of his duties as he may prescribe;\" and the Prime Minister was a mere head of the Cabinet.\n* for electoral reforms and provided that a natural born citizen of the Philippines who has lost his citizenship may be a transference of private land for use by him as his residence.\n\nThe last amendments in 1984 abolished the Executive Committee and restored the position of [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice-President]] (which did not exist in the original, unamended 1973 Constitution).\n{{anchor|1986 constitution}}\n\nWhile the 1973 Constitution ideally provided for a true parliamentary system, in practice, Marcos made use of subterfuge and manipulation in order to keep executive powers for himself, rather than [[devolution|devolving]] these to the Assembly and the cabinet headed by the Prime Minister. The end result was that the final form of the 1973 Constitution &ndash; after all amendments and subtle manipulations &ndash; was merely the abolition of the Senate and a series of cosmetic rewording. The old American-derived terminology was replaced by names more associated with a parliamentary government: for example, the House of Representatives became known as the \"''Batasang Pambans\u00e2''\" (National Assembly), departments became \"ministries\", and their cabinet secretaries became known as \"cabinet ministers\", with the President's assistant &ndash; the Executive Secretary &ndash; now being styled as the \"Prime Minister\". Marcos' purported parliamentary system in practice functioned as an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[presidential system]], with all real power concentrated in the hands of the President but with the premise that such was now constitutional.\n\n=== The 1986 Freedom Constitution ===\n{{see also|Revolutionary government in the Philippines}}\n{{wikisource|Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1986)|Proclamation \u2116 3: Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1986)}}\nImmediately following the [[1986 People Power Revolution]] that ousted Marcos, President [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]] issued Proclamation No. 3 as a [[provisional constitution]]. It adopted certain provisions from the 1973 Constitution while abolishing others. It granted the President broad powers to reorganize government and remove officials, as well as mandating the president to appoint a commission to draft a new, more formal Constitution.  This document, described above, supplanted the \"Freedom Constitution\" upon its [[ratification]] in 1987. This is the transitional constitution that lasted a year and came before the permanent constitution. It maintained many provisions of the 1973 [[Constitution]], including in rewritten form the presidential right to rule by decree. The Convention compose of 48 members appointed by the President.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Constitutionalism]]\n*[[Philippines charter change|Charter Change]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last= Cruz|first= Isagani|title= Constitutional Law|year= 1995|publisher= Central Lawbook Publishing Co., Inc.|location= Philippines  |isbn= 971-16-0333-0|pages= 18\u201320|chapter= The Nature of the Constitution}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gov.ph/constitution-day/ Evolution of Philippine Constitution]\n* [https://philippinesfreepress.wordpress.com/1986/04/19/corys-proclamation-no-3-april-19-1986/ Cory\u2019s Proclamation No. 3] by Napoleon G.

Its final draft was completed by the Constitutional Commission on October 12, 1986 and was ratified by a [[1987 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|nationwide plebiscite]] on February 2, 1987.\n\nThree other constitutions have effectively governed the country in its history: the 1935 Commonwealth Constitution, the 1973 Constitution, and the 1986 Freedom Constitution.\n[[File:Gold_In-Laid_Chest_(Repository_of_1935_Constitution).jpg|thumb|1935 Constitution and its tabernacle displayed at [[Quezon Memorial Circle]], [[Quezon City]]]]\nThe earliest constitution establishing a \"Philippine Republic\", the 1899 [[Malolos Constitution]], was never fully implemented throughout the Philippines and did not establish a state that was internationally recognized, due in great part to the eruption of the [[Philippine\u2013American War]] following its adoption.\n\n==Background of the 1987 Constitution==\n{{main|Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986}}\nRuling by decree during the early months of her tenure as a president installed via the [[People Power Revolution]], President [[Corazon Aquino]] was granted three options: restore to 1935 Constitution, retain and make reforms to the 1973 Constitution, or pass a new constitution. She decided to draft a new constitution and issued Proclamation No. 3 on March 25, 1986, abrogating many of the provisions of th 1973 Constitution adopted during the Marcos regime, including the [[unicameral legislature]] (the [[Batasang Pambansa]]), the office of [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]], and provisions which gave the President legislative powers. Often called the \"Freedom Constitution\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chanrobles.com/aquinoproclamationo3.htm#.XeZXRXduLIU|title=1986 PROVISIONAL (FREEDOM) CONSTITUTION OF THE PHILIPPINES - CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|website=chanrobles.com|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> this constitution was intended as a transitional constitution to ensure democracy and the freedom of the people. The Freedom Constitution provided for an orderly transfer of power while a [[Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986|Constitutional Commission]] was drafting a permanent constitution.\n\nThe Constitutional Commission was composed of forty-eight members appointed by Aquino from varied backgrounds, including several former members of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], former justices of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], a Roman Catholic bishop, and political activists against the Marcos regime. The Commission elected [[Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz-Palma]], a former Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], as its president. Several issues were of particular contention during the Commission's sessions, including the form of government to adopt, the abolition of the death penalty, the retention of U.S. bases in [[Clark Air Base|Clark]] and [[Subic Bay Naval Base|Subic]], and the integration of economic policies into the constitution. [[Lino Brocka]], a film director and political activist who was a member of the Commission, walked out before the constitution's completion, and two other delegates dissented from the final draft. The Commission finished the final draft on October 12, 1986 and presented it to Aquino on October 15. The constitution was ratified by a [[1987 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|nationwide plebiscite on February 8, 1987]].\n\nThe constitution provided for three governmental powers, namely the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]], and [[Judiciary|judicial branches]]. The executive branch is headed by the president and his appointed cabinet members. The executive, same with the other two co-equal branches, has limited power. This is to ensure that the country will be \"safeguarded\" if martial law is to be declared. The president can still declare martial law, but it expires within 60 days and Congress can either reject or extend it.\n\nThe task of the Supreme Court is to review whether a declaration of martial law is just. The legislative power consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. There are twenty-four senators and the House is composed of district representatives. It also created opportunities for under-represented sectors of community to select their representative through party-list system. The judiciary branch comprises the Supreme Court and the lower courts. The Supreme Court is granted the power to hear any cases that deals with the constitutionality of law, about a treaty or decree of the government. It is also tasked to administrate the function of the lower courts.\n\nThrough the constitution, three independent Constitutional Commissions, namely the Civil Service Commission, Commission on Elections, and Commission on Audit, were created. These Constitutional Commissions have different functions. The constitution also paved a way for the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman, which has a function of promoting and ensuring an ethical and lawful conduct of the government.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Readings in Philippine History|last=Candelaria and Alphora|first=Jhon Lee and Veronica|publisher=Rex Book Store, Inc.|year=2018|isbn=978-971-23-8665-7|location=Recto Avenue, Manila, Philippines|pages=71-82}}</ref>\n\n== Attempts to amend or change the 1987 Constitution ==\nThere are three possible methods by which the [[Constitution]] can be amended: a [[Constituent assembly|Constituent Assembly]] (Con-Ass), [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] (Con-Con), or [[People's Initiative]]. All three methods require [[ratification]] by majority vote in a national [[referendum]]. Following the administration of [[Corazon Aquino]], succeeding administrations made several attempts to [[Amendment|amend]] or change the 1987 Constitution.<ref>{{Citation|title=Constitutional reform in the Philippines|date=2019-09-17|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitutional_reform_in_the_Philippines&oldid=916106923|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref>\n\nThe first attempt was in 1995. A constitution was drafted by then-Secretary of [[National Security Council (Philippines)|National Security Council]] [[Jose T. Almonte|Jose Almonte]], but was never completed because it was exposed to the media by different non-government organizations. They saw through a potential change regarding the protection of the people's interests in the constitutional draft.\n\nIn 1997, the Pedrosa couple created a group called PIRMA followed with an attempt to change the constitution through a People's Initiative by way of gathering signatures from voters. Many prominent figures opposed the proposition, including Senator [[Miriam Defensor Santiago|Miriam Defensor-Santiago]], who brought the issue all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] and eventually won the case. The Supreme Court ruled that the initiative not continue, stating that a People's Initiative requires an enabling law for it to push through.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1997/mar1997/gr_127325_1997.html|title=G.R.

The attempt never attained its purpose after various entities opposed it due apparently to the attempt serving the personal interests of the initiators. \n\nAfter the Estrada presidency, the administration of [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] endorsed constitutional changes via a Constitutional Assembly, with then-House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia Jr.|Jose de Venecia]] leading the way. However, due to political controversies surrounding Arroyo's administration, including the possibility of term extension, the proposal was shut down.\n\nThe next attempt was from then-Speaker of the House [[Feliciano Belmonte Jr.|Feliciano Belmonte Jr]]. during President [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s administration. Belmonte attempted to introduce ammendments to the Constitution focusing on economic provisions aiming toward liberalization. The effort did not succeeded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iper.org.ph/documentation/Chap%2001.pdf|title=Changing the constitution|website=IPER|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Rodrigo Duterte|Rodrigo Roa Duterte]] oversaw the possibility of implementing federalism on the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/124985-duterte-federalism-regions-income|title=Duterte: Federalism allows regions to keep most of their income|last=Ranada|first=Pia|website=Rappler|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> Following his ascension as president after the [[2016 Philippine presidential election|2016 presidential election]], he signed  [[Philippine Executive Order 10|Executive Order No. 10]] on December 7, 2016, creating the Consultative Committee to Review the 1987 Constitution.\n\n== Structure and contents<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/|title=Structure of the 1987 Constitution|website=www.officialgazette.gov.ph}}</ref> ==\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1987)}}\n\nThe preamble and eighteen self-contained articles with a section numbering that resets for every article.\n\n=== Preamble ===\n\nThe preamble introduces the constitution and the source of sovereignty, the people. It follows the pattern in past constitutions, including an appeal to God.

It enumerates two kinds of citizens: natural-born citizens and naturalized citizens. Natural-born citizens are those who are citizens from birth without having to perform any act to acquire or perfect Philippine citizenship.

This section also provides important provisions such as:\n\n* Promote effective industrialization and aim for a full employment of its people\n* All natural resources within the Philippine territory shall be owned by the State\n* Protect the rights of the indigenous cultural communities\n* Businesses, organizations and other institutions shall be subject to the intervention of the State\n\n===Article XIII \u2013 Social Justice and Human Rights===\nArticle XIII divulge the utmost responsibility of the Congress to give the highest priority in enactments of such measures which protects and enhances the rights of all the people to human dignity through affirming that present social, economic and political inequalities as well as cultural inequities among the elites and the poor shall be reduced or removed in order to secure equitable welfare and common good among Filipino people.

Moreover, this section also lays down salient provisions such as:\n\n* Protection of labor, be it local or overseas in order to promote full employment and equal opportunities for all.\n* Protection of the rights  and giving of support to independent Filipino farmers and fishermen among local communities for the utilization of their resources without foreign intrusion, together with the provision and application of Agrarian and Natural Resources Reform for the development of the lives of the people.\n* Securing of the lives among the underprivileged citizens through Urban Land Reforms and Housing.\n* Adoption and integration of affordable and competent medical care and health services for the welfare of every Filipino people.\n* Recognition of the rights of women in workplace for the realization of their full potential in providing service to its nation.\n* Recognition of the role and the rights of people's organizations.\n\n===Article XIV \u2013 Education, Science and Technology, Arts, Culture and Sports===\n{{Empty section|date=February 2020}}\n===Article XV \u2013 The Family===\nArticle XV establishes the recognition of the state on the Filipino family as the basic foundation of the nation as it shall reinforce and bolster its solidarity and steadily promote its development. Alongside with this, it also states important provisions such as:\n\n* Protection of marriage by the state as it is recognized as the foundation of the family and is an inviolable institution.\n* Provision of policies and programs subject to every Filipino family assuring the people's welfare and social security.\n* Protection of the rights of spouses with responsible parenthood to found a family in accordance with their religious convictions.\n* Recognition and protection of the rights of every Filipino children.\n\n===Article XVI \u2013 General Provisions===\n{{Empty section|date=February 2020}}\n===Article XVII \u2013 Amendments or Revisions===\n\nArticle XVII establishes the methods by which the Constitution may be amended or revised. Amendments may be proposed by either: a) a three-fourths vote of all Members of Congress (called a [[Constituent Assembly (Philippines)|Constituent Assembly]]), b) a [[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Constitutional Convention]], or c) a petition of at least twelve percent of all registered voters, and at least three percent of registered voters within each district (called a [[People's Initiative]]). All amendments must be ratified in a national [[referendum]].\n\n===Article XVIII \u2013 Transitory Provisions===\n\nThe Constitution also contains several other provisions enumerating various state policies including, i.e., the affirmation of [[Labor (economics)|labor]] \"as a primary social economic force\" (Section 14, Article II); the equal protection of \"the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception\" (Section 12, Article II); the \"Filipino family as the foundation of the nation\" (Article XV, Section 1); the recognition of [[Filipino language|Filipino]] as \"the national language of the Philippines\" (Section 6, Article XIV), and even a requirement that \"all educational institutions shall undertake regular sports activities throughout the country in cooperation with athletic clubs and other sectors.\" (Section 19.1, Article XIV) Whether these provisions may, by themselves, be the source of enforceable rights without accompanying legislation has been the subject of considerable debate in the legal sphere and within the Supreme Court. The Court, for example, has ruled that a provision requiring that the State \"guarantee equal access to opportunities to public service\" could not be enforced without accompanying legislation, and thus could not bar the disallowance of so-called \"nuisance candidates\" in presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2004/apr2004/161872.htm\n|title=Pamatong vs. Comelec (G.R.

On March 24, 1934, the United States passed the [[Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act]] that allowed the nation to have self-government through a ten-year transitional period in preparation for full independence. The United States recognized Philippine independence in the [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Treaty of Manila]] on July 4, 1946.</ref> and therefore was under the jurisdiction of the [[Federal Government of the United States]]. Two acts of the United States Congress passed during this period can be considered Philippine constitutions in that those acts defined the fundamental political principles and established the structure, procedures, powers and duties of the Philippine government.\n\n====Philippine Organic Act of 1902====\nThe [[Philippine Organic Act (1902)|Philippine Organic Act of 1902]], sometimes known as the \"Philippine Bill of 1902\" or the \"Cooper Act\", was the first [[organic law]] for the Philippine Islands enacted by the United States Congress. It provided for the creation of a popularly elected [[Philippine Assembly]], and specified that legislative power would be vested in a bicameral legislature composed of the [[Taft Commission|Philippine Commission]] (upper house) and the Philippine Assembly (lower house). Its key provisions included a [[bill of rights]] for the Filipinos and the appointment of two non-voting Filipino [[Resident Commissioner of the Philippines]] to represent the Philippines in the [[United States House of Representatives]].\n\n====Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916====\nThe [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916]], sometimes known as the \"Jones Law\", modified the structure of the Philippine government by removing the Philippine Commission as the legislative upper house and replacing it with a [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] elected by Filipino voters, creating the Philippines' first fully elected national legislature. This act also explicitly stated that it was and always had been the purpose of the people of the United States to renounce their sovereignty over the Philippine Islands and to recognize Philippine independence as soon as a stable government can be established therein.\n\n===='''Hare\u2013Hawes\u2013Cutting Act (1932)'''====\n\nThough not a constitution itself, the [[Hare\u2013Hawes\u2013Cutting Act]] of 1932 was the precursor the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act, which laid down the promise of independence to the Philippines after 10 years of transition period and other provisions; however, because of infighting within the Philippine Congress, it was not ratified and only became the basis for the creation of the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act.\n\n====Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act (1934)====\nThough also not a constitution itself, the [[Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act]] of 1934 provided for autonomy and defined mechanisms for the establishment of a formal constitution via a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]].\n{{anchor|1935 constitution}}\n\n=== The 1935 Constitution ===\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1935)}}\nThe 1935 Constitution was written, approved and adopted in 1934 by the Commonwealth of the Philippines (1935\u20131946) and later used by the Third Republic (1946\u20131972). It was written with an eye to meeting the approval of the [[United States Government]] as well, so as to ensure that the U.S. would live up to its promise to grant the Philippines independence and not have a premise to hold onto its possession on the grounds that it was too politically immature and hence unready for full, real independence. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} \n\nThe Commonwealth Constitution was ratified to prepare the country for its independence. This constitution was dominantly influenced by the Americans, but possess the traces of the Malolos Constitution, the German, Spanish, and Mexican Constitution, constitutions of several South American countries, and the unwritten English Constitution.\n\nIt originally provided for a unicameral legislature composed of a president and vice president elected for a six-year term without re-election. It was amended in 1940 to provide for a bicameral legislature composed of a Senate and a House of Representatives. The President is to be elected to a four-year term, together with the Vice-President, with one re-election; the right of suffrage for male citizens of the Philippines who are twenty-one years of age or over and are able to read and write were protected; this protection, later on, extended to the right of suffrage for women two years after the adoption of the constitution.\n\nThe draft of the constitution was approved by the convention on February 8, 1935 and was ratified by President Roosevelt in Washington D.C. on March 25, 1935. Elections were held on September 16, 1935 and Manuel L. Quezon was elected as the first President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.\n\nThe Preamble reads:\n\n:{{cquote|\"The Filipino people, imploring the aid of Divine Providence, in order to establish a government that shall embody their ideals, conserve and develop the patrimony of the nation, promote the general welfare, and secure to themselves and their posterity the blessings of independence under a regime of justice, liberty, and democracy, do ordain and promulgate this Constitution.\"}}\n\nThe original 1935 Constitution provided for a unicameral National Assembly, and the President was elected to a six-year term without the possibility re-election. It was [[Constitutional amendment|amended]] in 1940 to have a bicameral Congress composed of a Senate and House of Representatives, as well the creation of an independent [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|electoral commission]] and to grant the President a four-year term with a maximum of two consecutive terms in office.\n\nA [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] was held in 1971 to rewrite the 1935 Constitution. The convention was stained with manifest bribery and corruption. Possibly the most controversial issue was removing the presidential term limit so that [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos]] could seek re-election for a third term, which many felt was the true reason for which the convention was called. In any case, the 1935 Constitution was suspended in 1972 with Marcos' proclamation of [[martial law]], the rampant corruption of the constitutional process providing him with one of his major premises for doing so. \n{{anchor|1943 constitution}}\n\n=== The 1943 Constitution ===\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1943)}}\n[[File:Laurel addresses National Assembly to approve 1943 Constitution.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel, President of the Second Philippine Republic, addresses the National Assembly in what is now the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Legislative Building]] to approve the 1943 Constitution.]]\nThe 1943 Constitution was drafted by a committee appointed by the [[Philippine Executive Commission]], the body established by the Japanese to administer the Philippines in lieu of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] which had established a [[government-in-exile]]. In mid-1942, Japanese Premier [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]] promised the Filipinos \"the honor of independence\" which meant that the commission would be supplanted by a formal republic.\n\nThe [[Preparatory Committee for Philippine Independence]] tasked with drafting a new constitution was composed, in large part, of members of the prewar National Assembly and of individuals with experience as delegates to the convention that had drafted the 1935 Constitution. Their draft for the republic to be established under the Japanese occupation, however, would be limited in duration, provide for indirect, instead of direct, legislative elections, and an even stronger executive branch.\n\nUpon the approval of the draft by the Committee, the new charter was ratified in 1943 by an assembly of appointed, provincial representatives of the [[Kalibapi]], the organization established by the Japanese to supplant all previous political parties. Upon the ratification by the Kalibapi assembly, the Second Republic was formally proclaimed (1943\u20131945). [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] was elected President by the National Assembly and sworn into office on October 14, 1943. Laurel was highly regarded by the Japanese for having openly criticized the U.S. for the way that they governed the Philippines and because he had a degree from the [[Tokyo International University]].\n\nThe 1943 Constitution remained in force in Japanese-controlled areas of the Philippines, but was never recognized as legitimate or binding by the governments of the United States, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, or the guerrilla organizations loyal to them. In late 1944, President Laurel declared war on the United States and the [[British Empire]] and proclaimed [[martial law]], essentially ruling by decree. His government, in turn, went into exile in December 1944, first to [[Taiwan]] and then Japan. After the announcement of Japan's surrender, Laurel formally dissolved the Second Republic.\n\nThe Preamble reads:\n\n:{{cquote|\"The Filipino people, imploring the aid of Divine Providence and desiring to lead a free national existence, do hereby proclaim their independence, and in order to establish a government that shall promote the general welfare, conserve and develop the patrimony of the Nation, and contribute to the creation of a world order based on peace, liberty, and moral justice, do ordain this Constitution.\"}}\n\nThe 1943 Constitution provided for strong executive powers. The Legislature consisted of a [[unicameral]] National Assembly and only those considered to be anti-US could stand for election, although in practice most legislators were appointed rather than elected.\n{{anchor|1973 constitution}}\n\nUntil the 1960s, the Second Republic and its officers were not viewed as a legitimate Philippine government or as having any standing with the exception of the Second Republic-era Supreme Court, whose decisions, limited to reviews of criminal and commercial cases as part of a policy of discretion by Chief Justice [[Jos\u00e9 Yulo]], continued to be part of official records. This was made easier by the Commonwealth government-in-exile never constituting a Supreme Court, and the formal vacancy in the position of Chief Justice for the Commonwealth with the execution of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]] by the Japanese. It was only during the Macapagal administration that a partial political rehabilitation of the Japanese-era republic took place, with the official recognition of Laurel as a former president and the addition of his cabinet and other officials to the roster of past government officials. However, the 1943 Constitution was not taught in schools, and the laws of the 1943\u201344 National Assembly were never recognized as valid or relevant.\n\n=== The 1973 Constitution ===\n{{see also|Ratification Cases}}\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1973)}}\nThe 1973 Constitution, promulgated after Marcos' [[Proclamation No. 1081|declaration of martial law]], was supposed to introduce a [[Parliamentary government|parliamentary-style government]]. Legislative power was vested in a [[unicameral]] National Assembly whose members were elected for six-year terms. The President was ideally elected as the symbolic and purely [[Figurehead|ceremonial]] [[head of state]] chosen from amongst the Members of the National Assembly for a six-year term and could be re-elected to an unlimited number of terms. Upon election, the President ceased to be a Member of the National Assembly. During his term, the President was not allowed to be a member of a [[political party]] or hold any other office.\n\nExecutive power was meant to be exercised by the [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] who was also elected from among the sitting Assemblymen. The Prime Minister was to be the [[head of government]] and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Armed Forces]]. This constitution was subsequently amended four times (arguably five, depending on how one considers Proclamation \u2116 3 of 1986, see below).\n\nFrom 16\u201317 October 1976, a majority of [[barangay]] voters (also called \"Citizens' Assemblies\") approved that [[martial law]] should be continued and ratified the amendments to the Constitution proposed by President Marcos.{{refn|In Sanidad vs. Comelec, L-44640, October 12, 1976 the Supreme Court ruled that on the basis of absolute necessity both the constituent power (the power to formulate a Constitution or to propose amendments or revision to the Constitution and to ratify such proposal, which is exclusively vested to the National Assembly, the Constitutional Convention, and the electorate) and legislative powers of the legislature may be exercised by the Chief Executive.<ref>[http://berneguerrero.com/node/90 Summary: Sanidad vs. Commission on Elections (GR L-44640, 12 October 1976)], [http://berneguerrero.com/ berneguerrero.com].</ref><ref>[http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1976/oct1976/gr_44640_1976.html G.R. No. L-44640 October 12, 1976], [http://www.lawphil.net lawphil.net].</ref>}}\n\nThe 1976 amendments provided:\n* for an [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] (IBP) substituting for the Interim National Assembly;\n* that the President would become Prime Minister and continue to exercise legislative powers until such time as martial law was lifted.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment authorized the President to legislate on his own on an \"emergency\" basis:\n\n<blockquote>Whenever in the judgement of the President there exists a grave emergency or a threat or imminence thereof, or whenever the Interim Batasang Pambansa or the regular National Assembly fails or is unable to act adequately on any matter for any reason that in his judgment requires immediate action, he may, in order to meet the exigency, issue the necessary decrees, orders or letters of instructions, which shall form part of the law of the land.</blockquote>\n\nThe 1973 Constitution was further amended in 1980 and 1981. In the 1980 amendment, the retirement age of the members of the judiciary was extended to 70 years. In the 1981 amendments, the false parliamentary system was formally modified into a [[Cabinet of France|French]]-style [[semi-presidential system]] and provided:\n* that executive power was restored to the President;\n* that direct election of the President was restored;\n* for an Executive Committee composed of the Prime Minister and not more than 14 members was created to \"assist the President in the exercise of his powers and functions and in the performance of his duties as he may prescribe;\" and the Prime Minister was a mere head of the Cabinet.\n* for electoral reforms and provided that a natural born citizen of the Philippines who has lost his citizenship may be a transference of private land for use by him as his residence.\n\nThe last amendments in 1984 abolished the Executive Committee and restored the position of [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice-President]] (which did not exist in the original, unamended 1973 Constitution).\n{{anchor|1986 constitution}}\n\nWhile the 1973 Constitution ideally provided for a true parliamentary system, in practice, Marcos made use of subterfuge and manipulation in order to keep executive powers for himself, rather than [[devolution|devolving]] these to the Assembly and the cabinet headed by the Prime Minister. The end result was that the final form of the 1973 Constitution &ndash; after all amendments and subtle manipulations &ndash; was merely the abolition of the Senate and a series of cosmetic rewording. The old American-derived terminology was replaced by names more associated with a parliamentary government: for example, the House of Representatives became known as the \"''Batasang Pambans\u00e2''\" (National Assembly), departments became \"ministries\", and their cabinet secretaries became known as \"cabinet ministers\", with the President's assistant &ndash; the Executive Secretary &ndash; now being styled as the \"Prime Minister\". Marcos' purported parliamentary system in practice functioned as an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[presidential system]], with all real power concentrated in the hands of the President but with the premise that such was now constitutional.\n\n=== The 1986 Freedom Constitution ===\n{{see also|Revolutionary government in the Philippines}}\n{{wikisource|Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1986)|Proclamation \u2116 3: Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1986)}}\nImmediately following the [[1986 People Power Revolution]] that ousted Marcos, President [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]] issued Proclamation \u2116 3 as a [[provisional constitution]]. It adopted certain provisions from the 1973 Constitution while abolishing others. It granted the President broad powers to reorganize government and remove officials, as well as mandating the president to appoint a commission to draft a new, more formal Constitution.  This document, described above, supplanted the \"Freedom Constitution\" upon its [[ratification]] in 1987. This is the transitional constitution that lasted a year and came before the permanent constitution. It maintained many provisions of the 1973 [[Constitution]], including in rewritten form the presidential right to rule by decree. The Convention compose of 48 members appointed by the President.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Constitutionalism]]\n*[[Philippines charter change|Charter Change]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last= Cruz|first= Isagani|title= Constitutional Law|year= 1995|publisher= Central Lawbook Publishing Co., Inc.|location= Philippines  |isbn= 971-16-0333-0|pages= 18\u201320|chapter= The Nature of the Constitution}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gov.ph/constitution-day/ Evolution of Philippine Constitution]\n* [https://philippinesfreepress.wordpress.com/1986/04/19/corys-proclamation-no-3-april-19-1986/ Cory\u2019s Proclamation No. 3] by Napoleon G.
