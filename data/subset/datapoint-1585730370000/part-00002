Mitchell said, \"It\u2019s the wrong thing for a leader to say,\" and he told the leader, \"It\u2019s politically damaging to the party, to the country.\" A few days later, while Mitchell waited to go on to a prime-time T.V. network appearance, he saw a clip of Trump rally attendees chanting, \"send her back,\" aimed at one of the congresswomen, Rep. [[Ilhan Omar]] (D-Minn.). Mitchell asked an aide: \"How do I even respond to this on TV?\" For Mitchell, the final straw was the refusal of Trump staffers to listen. Mitchell begged Vice President [[Mike Pence]], and the Vice President's Chief of Staff, Marc Short, to arrange a one-on-one conversation between Mitchell and Trump to address his misgivings.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-takeover-of-gop-forces-many-house-republicans-to-head-for-the-exits/2019/09/22/d89f99fc-d4bd-11e9-ab26-e6dbebac45d3_story.html], ''[[Washington Post]]'', September 22, 2019.
