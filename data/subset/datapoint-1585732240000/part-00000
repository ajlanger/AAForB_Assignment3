Fuat Koprulu championed the ''[[Ghazi thesis]]'' that saw the Ottoman state as a continuation of the way of life of the nomadic [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] who had come from East Asia to Anatolia via Central Asia and the Middle East on a much larger scale. They argued that the most important cultural influences on the Ottoman state came from Persia.<ref>Ronald C.

Stone also pointed out that despite the fact that Sunni Islam was the state religion, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was supported and controlled by the Ottoman state, and in return to accepting that control became the largest land-holder in the Ottoman Empire. Despite the similarities, Stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the ''timar'' system were not hereditary at first. Even after land grants under the ''timar'' system became inheritable, land ownings in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished. Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged ''[[Timariot]]s'' from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led the ''timariots'' to adopt a strategy of short term exploitation, which ultimately had deleterious effects on the Ottoman economy.<ref>Stone, pp. 94-95.</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n{{Main|State organisation of the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Jean Baptiste Vanmour - Dinner at the Palace in Honour of an Ambassador - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Ambassadors at the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]]]]\n\nBefore the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries, the [[state organisation of the Ottoman Empire]] was a system with two main dimensions, the military administration and the civil administration. The Sultan was the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The state had control over the clergy.

The Ottoman dynasty was Turkish in origin. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the Ottoman dynasty, who were either the former sultan's brother, son or nephew) because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.<ref name=\"Kapucu\"/> As such, the last Ottoman sultan Mehmed VI (r. 1918\u20131922) was a [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|direct patrilineal (male-line) descendant]] of the first Ottoman sultan [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), which was unparallelled in both Europe (e.g. the male line of the House of Habsburg became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world.

The politics of the state had a number of advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as [[Divan]]. The Divan, in the years when the Ottoman state was still a ''[[Bey]]lik'', was composed of the elders of the tribe. Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors). Later still, beginning in 1320, a Grand Vizier was appointed to assume certain of the sultan's responsibilities. The Grand Vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment, dismissal and supervision. Beginning with the late 16th century, sultans withdrew from politics and the Grand Vizier became the ''de facto'' head of state.<ref name=\"Black p199\"/>\n\n[[File:Yusuf Ziya Pa\u015fa.jpg|thumb|[[Yusuf Ziya Pasha]], Ottoman ambassador to the [[United States]], in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], 1913]]\n\nThroughout Ottoman history, there were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy. The sultan no longer had executive powers. A parliament was formed, with representatives chosen from the provinces.

The entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative ''Qanun'', i.e. laws, a system based upon the Turkic ''[[Yassa]]'' and ''[[T\u00f6re (law)|T\u00f6re]]'', which were developed in the pre-Islamic era.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|An Ottoman trial, 1877]]\n\nThese court categories were not, however, wholly exclusive: for instance, the Islamic courts, which were the Empire's primary courts, could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and Jews and Christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue. The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic ''Sharia'' law system had been developed from a combination of the [[Qur'an]]; the [[Hadith|Had\u012bth]], or words of the prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]; ''[[ijma|ijm\u0101']]'', or consensus of the members of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]; [[qiyas]], a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs.

The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding. The main corps of the [[Ottoman Army]] included Janissary, [[Sipahi]], [[Akinci|Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] and [[Ottoman military band|Mehter\u00e2n]]. The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons. The Ottoman Turks began using ''[[Falconet (cannon)|falconets]]'', which were short but wide cannons, during the [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|Siege of Constantinople]].

In 1826 Sultan Mahmud II abolished the Janissary corps and established the modern Ottoman army. He named them as the [[Nizam-\u0131 Cedid]] (New Order). The Ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western European countries. Consequently, the Young Turks movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Navy]] vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent. It initiated the conquest of North Africa, with the addition of [[Algeria]] and Egypt to the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Starting with the loss of [[Greece]] in 1821 and Algeria in 1830, Ottoman naval power and control over the Empire's distant overseas territories began to decline. Sultan [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] (reigned 1861\u20131876) attempted to reestablish a strong Ottoman navy, building the largest fleet after those of Britain and France.

Sultan [[Abd\u00fclhamid II]] distrusted the admirals who sided with the reformist [[Midhat Pasha]], and claimed that the large and expensive fleet was of no use against the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War. He locked most of the fleet inside the [[Golden Horn]], where the ships decayed for the next 30 years.

Steadily the Ottoman military power became outdated, but when the Janissaries felt their privileges were being threatened, or outsiders wanted to modernize them, or they might be superseded by the cavalrymen, they rose in rebellion. The rebellions were highly violent on both sides, but by the time the Janissaries were suppressed, it was far too late for Ottoman military power to catch up with the West. <ref>Peter Mansfield, ''A History of the Middle East'' (1991) p. 31.</ref><ref>Oleg Benesch,  \"Comparing Warrior Traditions: How the Janissaries and Samurai Maintained Their Status and Privileges During Centuries of Peace.\" ''Comparative Civilizations Review'' 55.55 (2006): 6:37-55 [https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1669&context=ccr Online].</ref> The political system was transformed by the destruction of the [[Janissaries]] in the [[Auspicious Incident]] of 1826, who were a very powerful military/governmental/police force that revolted. Sultan Mahmud II crushed the revolt, executed the leaders, and disbanded the large organization.  That set the stage for a slow process of modernization of government functions, as the government sought, with mixed success, to adopt the main elements of Western bureaucracy and military technology. The Janissaries had been recruited from Christians and other minorities; their abolition enabled the emergence of a Turkish elite to control the Ottoman Empire.  The problem was that the Turkish element was very poorly educated, lacking higher schools of any sort, and locked into a Turkish language that used Arabic alphabet that inhibited wider learning.  The large number of ethnic and religious minorities were tolerated in their own separate segregated domains called millets.<ref>Karen Barkey, and George Gavrilis, \"The Ottoman millet system: Non-territorial autonomy and its contemporary legacy.\" ''Ethnopolitics'' 15.1 (2016): 24\u201342.</ref> They were primarily [[Ottoman Greeks|Greek]], [[Ottoman Armenians|Armenian]] or [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish]].  In each locality they governed themselves, spoke their own language, ran their own schools, cultural and religious institutions, and paid somewhat higher taxes. They had no power outside the millet. The Imperial government protected them, and prevented major violent clashes between ethnic groups. However the millets showed very little loyalty to the Empire. Ethnic nationalism, based on distinctive religion and language, provided a centripetal force that eventually destroyed the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Donald Quataert, ''Social Disintegration and Popular Resistance in the Ottoman Empire 1881\u20131908'' (1083)</ref> In addition, Muslim ethnic groups, which were not part of the millett system, especially the Arabs and the Kurds, were outside the Turkish culture and developed their own separate nationalism. The British sponsored Arab nationalism in the First World War, promising an independent Arab state in return for Arab support.  Most Arabs supported the Sultan, but those near Mecca believed in and supported the British promise.<ref>Youssef M. Choueiri, ''Arab Nationalism: A History: Nation and State in the Arab World'' (2001), pp. 56\u2013100.</ref>\n\nAt the local level, power was held beyond the control of the Sultan by the [[Ottoman Ayan|\"ayan\"]] or local notables. The ayan collected taxes, formed local armies to compete with other notables, took a reactionary attitude toward political or economic change, and often defied policies handed down by the Sultan.<ref>{{cite book|author=G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston and Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA64|year=2010|publisher=Infobase |page=64|isbn=9781438110257}}</ref>\n\nThe economic system made little progress. Printing was forbidden until the 18th century,  for fear of defiling the secret documents of Islam. The millets, however, were allowed their own presses, using Greek, Hebrew, Armenian and other languages that greatly facilitated nationalism. The religious prohibition on charging interest foreclosed most of the entrepreneurial skills among Muslims, although it did flourish among the Jews and Christians.\n\nAfter the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was clearly shrinking, as Russia put on heavy pressure and expanded to its south; Egypt became effectively independent in 1805 and the British later took it over, along with Cyprus. Greece became independent, and Serbia and other Balkan areas became highly restive as the force of nationalism pushed against imperialism.  The French took over Algeria and Tunisia. The  Europeans all thought that the empire was a sick man in rapid decline. Only the Germans seemed helpful and their support led to the Ottoman Empire joining the central powers in 1915, with the end result that they came out as one of the heaviest losers of the First World War in 1918.<ref>Naci Yorulmaz, ''Arming the Sultan: German Arms Trade and Personal Diplomacy in the Ottoman Empire Before World War I'' (IB Tauris, 2014).</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Culture of the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}\n[[File:WaldmeierLebanon.gif|thumb|left|Depiction of a [[hookah]] shop in [[Lebanon]], Ottoman Empire]]\n\nThe Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them. Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (In fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who developed them into new forms, resulting in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity.

Poetry was by far the dominant stream. Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], short story, or novel. Analogue genres did exist, though, in both [[Turkish folk literature]] and in [[Divan poetry]].\n\nOttoman [[Divan poetry]] was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the [[Persian poetry]] that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships\u2014both of similitude (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0638\u064a\u0631 mura'\u00e2t-i naz\u00eer / \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628 ten\u00e2s\u00fcb) and opposition (\u062a\u0636\u0627\u062f tez\u00e2d) were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either [[gazel]]s (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kas\u00eedes. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the mesnev\u00ee, a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]; the two most notable examples of this form are the [[Leyli and Majnun]] of [[Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee]] and the [[H\u00fcsn \u00fc A\u015fk]] of [[\u015eeyh G\u00e2lib]].\n\n[[File:Nedim (divan edb.\u015fairi).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmet Ned\u00eem Efendi]], one of the most celebrated Ottoman poets]]\n\nUntil the 19th century, [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman prose]] did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (\u0633\u062c\u0639, also transliterated as seci), or [[rhymed prose]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Murat Belge |title=Osmanl\u0131'da kurumlar ve k\u00fclt\u00fcr |year=2005 |publisher=\u0130stanbul Bilgi \u00dcniversitesi Yay\u0131nlar\u0131 |isbn=978-975-8998-03-6 |page=389}}</ref> a type of writing descended from the Arabic [[saj']] and which prescribed that between each adjective and [[noun]] in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]]. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional in nature. One apparent exception was [[Muhayyel\u00e2t]] (\"Fancies\") by [[Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi]], a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796, though not published until 1867.

As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their Ottoman equivalents: in the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of [[Romanticism]] can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Parnassian poets|Parnassian]] movements that became paramount.\n\nMany of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet [[Nam\u0131k Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel \u0130ntib\u00e2h (\"Awakening\"), while the journalist [[\u0130brahim \u015einasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy \"\u015eair Evlenmesi\" (\"The Poet's Marriage\"). An earlier play, a [[farce]] entitled \"Vak\u00e2yi'-i 'Acibe ve Hav\u00e2dis-i Garibe-yi Kef\u015fger Ahmed\" (\"The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed\"), dates from the beginning of the 19th century, but there remains some doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist [[Ahmed Midhat Efendi]] wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (Hasan Mell\u00e2h y\u00e2hud S\u0131rr \u0130\u00e7inde Esr\u00e2r, 1873; \"Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery\"), Realism (Hen\u00fcz On Yedi Ya\u015f\u0131nda, 1881; \"Just Seventeen Years Old\"), and Naturalism (M\u00fc\u015f\u00e2hed\u00e2t, 1891; \"Observations\"). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman [[social structure]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Berna|title=T\u00fcrk Roman\u0131na Ele\u015ftirel Bir Bak\u0131\u015f Vol. 1|isbn=978-975-470-054-1|page=19|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\n{{main|Media of the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Ottoman architecture}}\n[[File:Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace in 1862.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of the main entrance of [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] in 1862, taken by [[Francis Bedford (photographer)|Francis Bedford]]]]\n\n[[Ottoman architecture]] was influenced by [[Persian Architecture|Persian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Greek]] and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectures. During the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Rise period]] (The early or first Ottoman architecture period), Ottoman art was in search of new ideas. The [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|growth period]] of the Empire became the classical period of architecture, when Ottoman art was at its most confident. During the years of the [[Stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Stagnation period]], Ottoman architecture moved away from this style, however.\n\n[[File:Bridge on the Drina July 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed Pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107 Bridge]], completed in 1577 by [[Mimar Sinan]], the greatest architect of the classical period of Ottoman architecture]]\n\nDuring the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]], it was under the influence of the highly ornamented styles of Western Europe; [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Empire (style)|Empire]] and other styles intermingled. Concepts of Ottoman architecture concentrate mainly on the [[Mosque#Architecture|mosque]]. The mosque was integral to society, [[Urban planning|city planning]] and communal life. Besides the mosque, it is also possible to find good examples of Ottoman architecture in [[soup kitchen]]s, theological schools, hospitals, [[Turkish bath]]s and tombs.\n\nExamples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, besides Istanbul<!--Modern day naming, so this OK--> and [[Edirne]]<!--Modern day naming, so this OK-->, can also be seen in Egypt, Eritrea, Tunisia, Algiers, the Balkans and Romania, where mosques, bridges, fountains and schools were built. The art of Ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the Ottoman Empire. The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences, such as mixing traditional [[Byzantine art]] with elements of [[Chinese art]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Eli Shah |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |title=The Ottoman Artistic Legacy |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213131926/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |archivedate=13 February 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Decorative arts ===\n[[File:Ottoman miniature painters.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman miniature painters]]\n\nThe tradition of [[Ottoman miniature]]s, painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] art form, though it also included elements of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition of [[manuscript illumination|illumination]] and painting.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A Greek academy of painters, the ''Nakkashane-i-Rum'', was established in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the ''Nakkashane-i-Irani'', was added.\n\n[[Ottoman illumination]] covers non-figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in ''[[muraqqa]]'' or albums, as opposed to the figurative images of the [[Ottoman miniature]]. It was a part of the Ottoman Book Arts together with the Ottoman miniature (''taswir''), calligraphy (''hat''), [[Islamic calligraphy]], bookbinding (''cilt'') and [[paper marbling]] (''ebru''). In the Ottoman Empire, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated and illustrated manuscripts]] were commissioned by the Sultan or the administrators of the court. In Topkapi Palace, these manuscripts were created by the artists working in ''Nakkashane'', the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists. Both religious and non-religious books could be illuminated. Also sheets for albums ''levha'' consisted of illuminated calligraphy (''hat'') of ''[[tughra]]'', religious texts, verses from poems or proverbs, and purely decorative drawings.\n\nThe art of carpet [[weaving]] was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism, and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.<ref name=\"foroqhi\">{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire|year=2005|publisher=I.B.

Turks used carpets, rugs and [[kilim]]s not just on the floors of a room, but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to [[mosques]], which often amassed large collections of them.<ref name=\"foroqhip153\">{{cite book |last=Faroqhi |first=Suraiya |title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire |edition=New |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

A number of the Ottoman sultans were accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as [[Selim III]], whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of [[Byzantine music]], [[Armenian music]], [[Arabic music]], and [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]. Compositionally, it is organised around rhythmic units called [[Usul (music)|usul]], which are somewhat similar to [[Metre (music)|meter]] in Western music, and [[Melody|melodic]] units called [[makam]], which bear some resemblance to Western [[musical mode]]s.\n\nThe [[Musical instrument|instruments]] used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the [[baglama|saz]], the [[Baglama|ba\u011flama]], the [[Kemenche|kemence]]), other Middle Eastern instruments (the [[Oud|ud]], the [[tanbur]], the [[Qanun (instrument)|kanun]], the [[ney]]), and\u2014later in the tradition\u2014Western instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music, and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of [[folk music]] were created. The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are: Balkan-Thracian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, North-Eastern ([[Laz people|Laz]]) T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Aegean T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Central Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Eastern Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, and Caucasian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs. Some of the distinctive styles were: [[Ottoman military band|Janissary Music]], [[Roma music]], [[Belly dance]], [[Turkish folk music]].\n\nThe traditional [[shadow play]] called [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire and featured characters representing all of the major ethnic and social groups in that culture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat, a Turkish shadow play |publisher=All About Turkey |date=20 November 2006 |url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/karagoz.htm |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Emin \u015eenyer |title=Karagoz, Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre |publisher=Karagoz.net |url=http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm |accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref> It was performed by a single puppet master, who voiced all of the characters, and accompanied by [[tambourine]] (''def'').

This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through [[Ramadan]] events, and through the cooking at the [[Yal\u0131]]s of the [[Pasha]]s, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.\n\nMuch of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from a shared Ottoman cuisine, especially [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], and including [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] cuisines.<ref name=\"Fragner\">Bert Fragner, \"From the Caucasus to the Roof of the World: a culinary adventure\", in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London, [[Prague]] and New York, p. 52</ref> Many common dishes in the region, descendants of the once-common Ottoman cuisine, include [[yogurt]], [[d\u00f6ner kebab]]/[[Gyro (food)|gyro]]/[[shawarma]], [[cac\u0131k]]/tzatziki, [[ayran]], [[pita]] bread, [[feta]] cheese, [[baklava]], [[lahmacun]], [[moussaka]], [[yuvarlak]], [[k\u00f6fte]]/keft\u00e9s/kofta, [[b\u00f6rek]]/boureki, [[rak\u0131]]/[[rakia]]/[[tsipouro]]/[[tsikoudia]], [[meze]], [[dolma]], [[Sarma (food)|sarma]], rice [[pilaf]], [[Turkish coffee]], [[sujuk]], [[kashk]], [[ke\u015fkek]], [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[lavash]], [[kanafeh]], and more.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{Main|Science and technology in the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Ottoman Imperial Museum (Today- Istanbul Archaeology Museums).jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman Imperial Museum, today the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]]]]\n\nOver the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts.<ref name=\"\u00c1goston and Alan Masters583\"/> A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century.

Fuat Koprulu championed the ''[[Ghazi thesis]]'' that saw the Ottoman state as a continuation of the way of life of the nomadic [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] who had come from East Asia to Anatolia via Central Asia and the Middle East on a much larger scale. They argued that the most important cultural influences on the Ottoman state came from Persia.<ref>Ronald C.

Stone also pointed out that despite the fact that Sunni Islam was the state religion, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was supported and controlled by the Ottoman state, and in return to accepting that control became the largest land-holder in the Ottoman Empire. Despite the similarities, Stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the ''timar'' system were not hereditary at first. Even after land grants under the ''timar'' system became inheritable, land ownings in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished. Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged ''[[Timariot]]s'' from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led the ''timariots'' to adopt a strategy of short term exploitation, which ultimately had deleterious effects on the Ottoman economy.<ref>Stone, pp. 94-95.</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n{{Main|State organisation of the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Jean Baptiste Vanmour - Dinner at the Palace in Honour of an Ambassador - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Ambassadors at the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]]]]\n\nBefore the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries, the [[state organisation of the Ottoman Empire]] was a system with two main dimensions, the military administration and the civil administration. The Sultan was the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The state had control over the clergy.

The Ottoman dynasty was Turkish in origin. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the Ottoman dynasty, who were either the former sultan's brother, son or nephew) because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.<ref name=\"Kapucu\"/> As such, the last Ottoman sultan Mehmed VI (r. 1918\u20131922) was a [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|direct patrilineal (male-line) descendant]] of the first Ottoman sultan [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), which was unparallelled in both Europe (e.g. the male line of the House of Habsburg became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world.

The politics of the state had a number of advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as [[Divan]]. The Divan, in the years when the Ottoman state was still a ''[[Bey]]lik'', was composed of the elders of the tribe. Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors). Later still, beginning in 1320, a Grand Vizier was appointed to assume certain of the sultan's responsibilities. The Grand Vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment, dismissal and supervision. Beginning with the late 16th century, sultans withdrew from politics and the Grand Vizier became the ''de facto'' head of state.<ref name=\"Black p199\"/>\n\n[[File:Yusuf Ziya Pa\u015fa.jpg|thumb|[[Yusuf Ziya Pasha]], Ottoman ambassador to the [[United States]], in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], 1913]]\n\nThroughout Ottoman history, there were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy. The sultan no longer had executive powers. A parliament was formed, with representatives chosen from the provinces.

The entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative ''Qanun'', i.e. laws, a system based upon the Turkic ''[[Yassa]]'' and ''[[T\u00f6re (law)|T\u00f6re]]'', which were developed in the pre-Islamic era.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|An Ottoman trial, 1877]]\n\nThese court categories were not, however, wholly exclusive: for instance, the Islamic courts, which were the Empire's primary courts, could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and Jews and Christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue. The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic ''Sharia'' law system had been developed from a combination of the [[Qur'an]]; the [[Hadith|Had\u012bth]], or words of the prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]; ''[[ijma|ijm\u0101']]'', or consensus of the members of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]; [[qiyas]], a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs.

The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding. The main corps of the [[Ottoman Army]] included Janissary, [[Sipahi]], [[Akinci|Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] and [[Ottoman military band|Mehter\u00e2n]]. The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons. The Ottoman Turks began using ''[[Falconet (cannon)|falconets]]'', which were short but wide cannons, during the [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|Siege of Constantinople]].

In 1826 Sultan Mahmud II abolished the Janissary corps and established the modern Ottoman army. He named them as the [[Nizam-\u0131 Cedid]] (New Order). The Ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western European countries. Consequently, the Young Turks movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Navy]] vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent. It initiated the conquest of North Africa, with the addition of [[Algeria]] and Egypt to the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Starting with the loss of [[Greece]] in 1821 and Algeria in 1830, Ottoman naval power and control over the Empire's distant overseas territories began to decline. Sultan [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] (reigned 1861\u20131876) attempted to reestablish a strong Ottoman navy, building the largest fleet after those of Britain and France.

Sultan [[Abd\u00fclhamid II]] distrusted the admirals who sided with the reformist [[Midhat Pasha]], and claimed that the large and expensive fleet was of no use against the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War. He locked most of the fleet inside the [[Golden Horn]], where the ships decayed for the next 30 years.

Steadily the Ottoman military power became outdated, but when the Janissaries felt their privileges were being threatened, or outsiders wanted to modernize them, or they might be superseded by the cavalrymen, they rose in rebellion. The rebellions were highly violent on both sides, but by the time the Janissaries were suppressed, it was far too late for Ottoman military power to catch up with the West. <ref>Peter Mansfield, ''A History of the Middle East'' (1991) p. 31.</ref><ref>Oleg Benesch,  \"Comparing Warrior Traditions: How the Janissaries and Samurai Maintained Their Status and Privileges During Centuries of Peace.\" ''Comparative Civilizations Review'' 55.55 (2006): 6:37-55 [https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1669&context=ccr Online].</ref> The political system was transformed by the destruction of the [[Janissaries]] in the [[Auspicious Incident]] of 1826, who were a very powerful military/governmental/police force that revolted. Sultan Mahmud II crushed the revolt, executed the leaders, and disbanded the large organization.  That set the stage for a slow process of modernization of government functions, as the government sought, with mixed success, to adopt the main elements of Western bureaucracy and military technology. The Janissaries had been recruited from Christians and other minorities; their abolition enabled the emergence of a Turkish elite to control the Ottoman Empire.  The problem was that the Turkish element was very poorly educated, lacking higher schools of any sort, and locked into a Turkish language that used Arabic alphabet that inhibited wider learning.  The large number of ethnic and religious minorities were tolerated in their own separate segregated domains called millets.<ref>Karen Barkey, and George Gavrilis, \"The Ottoman millet system: Non-territorial autonomy and its contemporary legacy.\" ''Ethnopolitics'' 15.1 (2016): 24\u201342.</ref> They were primarily [[Ottoman Greeks|Greek]], [[Ottoman Armenians|Armenian]] or [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish]].  In each locality they governed themselves, spoke their own language, ran their own schools, cultural and religious institutions, and paid somewhat higher taxes. They had no power outside the millet. The Imperial government protected them, and prevented major violent clashes between ethnic groups. However the millets showed very little loyalty to the Empire. Ethnic nationalism, based on distinctive religion and language, provided a centripetal force that eventually destroyed the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Donald Quataert, ''Social Disintegration and Popular Resistance in the Ottoman Empire 1881\u20131908'' (1083)</ref> In addition, Muslim ethnic groups, which were not part of the millett system, especially the Arabs and the Kurds, were outside the Turkish culture and developed their own separate nationalism. The British sponsored Arab nationalism in the First World War, promising an independent Arab state in return for Arab support.  Most Arabs supported the Sultan, but those near Mecca believed in and supported the British promise.<ref>Youssef M. Choueiri, ''Arab Nationalism: A History: Nation and State in the Arab World'' (2001), pp. 56\u2013100.</ref>\n\nAt the local level, power was held beyond the control of the Sultan by the [[Ottoman Ayan|\"ayan\"]] or local notables. The ayan collected taxes, formed local armies to compete with other notables, took a reactionary attitude toward political or economic change, and often defied policies handed down by the Sultan.<ref>{{cite book|author=G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston and Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA64|year=2010|publisher=Infobase |page=64|isbn=9781438110257}}</ref>\n\nThe economic system made little progress. Printing was forbidden until the 18th century,  for fear of defiling the secret documents of Islam. The millets, however, were allowed their own presses, using Greek, Hebrew, Armenian and other languages that greatly facilitated nationalism. The religious prohibition on charging interest foreclosed most of the entrepreneurial skills among Muslims, although it did flourish among the Jews and Christians.\n\nAfter the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was clearly shrinking, as Russia put on heavy pressure and expanded to its south; Egypt became effectively independent in 1805 and the British later took it over, along with Cyprus. Greece became independent, and Serbia and other Balkan areas became highly restive as the force of nationalism pushed against imperialism.  The French took over Algeria and Tunisia. The  Europeans all thought that the empire was a sick man in rapid decline. Only the Germans seemed helpful and their support led to the Ottoman Empire joining the central powers in 1915, with the end result that they came out as one of the heaviest losers of the First World War in 1918.<ref>Naci Yorulmaz, ''Arming the Sultan: German Arms Trade and Personal Diplomacy in the Ottoman Empire Before World War I'' (IB Tauris, 2014).</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Culture of the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}\n[[File:WaldmeierLebanon.gif|thumb|left|Depiction of a [[hookah]] shop in [[Lebanon]], Ottoman Empire]]\n\nThe Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them. Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (In fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who developed them into new forms, resulting in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity.

Poetry was by far the dominant stream. Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], short story, or novel. Analogue genres did exist, though, in both [[Turkish folk literature]] and in [[Divan poetry]].\n\nOttoman [[Divan poetry]] was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the [[Persian poetry]] that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships\u2014both of similitude (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0638\u064a\u0631 mura'\u00e2t-i naz\u00eer / \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628 ten\u00e2s\u00fcb) and opposition (\u062a\u0636\u0627\u062f tez\u00e2d) were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either [[gazel]]s (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kas\u00eedes. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the mesnev\u00ee, a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]; the two most notable examples of this form are the [[Leyli and Majnun]] of [[Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee]] and the [[H\u00fcsn \u00fc A\u015fk]] of [[\u015eeyh G\u00e2lib]].\n\n[[File:Nedim (divan edb.\u015fairi).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmet Ned\u00eem Efendi]], one of the most celebrated Ottoman poets]]\n\nUntil the 19th century, [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman prose]] did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (\u0633\u062c\u0639, also transliterated as seci), or [[rhymed prose]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Murat Belge |title=Osmanl\u0131'da kurumlar ve k\u00fclt\u00fcr |year=2005 |publisher=\u0130stanbul Bilgi \u00dcniversitesi Yay\u0131nlar\u0131 |isbn=978-975-8998-03-6 |page=389}}</ref> a type of writing descended from the Arabic [[saj']] and which prescribed that between each adjective and [[noun]] in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]]. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional in nature. One apparent exception was [[Muhayyel\u00e2t]] (\"Fancies\") by [[Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi]], a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796, though not published until 1867.

As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their Ottoman equivalents: in the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of [[Romanticism]] can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Parnassian poets|Parnassian]] movements that became paramount.\n\nMany of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet [[Nam\u0131k Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel \u0130ntib\u00e2h (\"Awakening\"), while the journalist [[\u0130brahim \u015einasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy \"\u015eair Evlenmesi\" (\"The Poet's Marriage\"). An earlier play, a [[farce]] entitled \"Vak\u00e2yi'-i 'Acibe ve Hav\u00e2dis-i Garibe-yi Kef\u015fger Ahmed\" (\"The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed\"), dates from the beginning of the 19th century, but there remains some doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist [[Ahmed Midhat Efendi]] wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (Hasan Mell\u00e2h y\u00e2hud S\u0131rr \u0130\u00e7inde Esr\u00e2r, 1873; \"Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery\"), Realism (Hen\u00fcz On Yedi Ya\u015f\u0131nda, 1881; \"Just Seventeen Years Old\"), and Naturalism (M\u00fc\u015f\u00e2hed\u00e2t, 1891; \"Observations\"). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman [[social structure]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Berna|title=T\u00fcrk Roman\u0131na Ele\u015ftirel Bir Bak\u0131\u015f Vol. 1|isbn=978-975-470-054-1|page=19|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\n{{main|Media of the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Ottoman architecture}}\n[[File:Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace in 1862.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of the main entrance of [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] in 1862, taken by [[Francis Bedford (photographer)|Francis Bedford]]]]\n\n[[Ottoman architecture]] was influenced by [[Persian Architecture|Persian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Greek]] and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectures. During the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Rise period]] (The early or first Ottoman architecture period), Ottoman art was in search of new ideas. The [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|growth period]] of the Empire became the classical period of architecture, when Ottoman art was at its most confident. During the years of the [[Stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Stagnation period]], Ottoman architecture moved away from this style, however.\n\n[[File:Bridge on the Drina July 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed Pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107 Bridge]], completed in 1577 by [[Mimar Sinan]], the greatest architect of the classical period of Ottoman architecture]]\n\nDuring the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]], it was under the influence of the highly ornamented styles of Western Europe; [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Empire (style)|Empire]] and other styles intermingled. Concepts of Ottoman architecture concentrate mainly on the [[Mosque#Architecture|mosque]]. The mosque was integral to society, [[Urban planning|city planning]] and communal life. Besides the mosque, it is also possible to find good examples of Ottoman architecture in [[soup kitchen]]s, theological schools, hospitals, [[Turkish bath]]s and tombs.\n\nExamples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, besides Istanbul<!--Modern day naming, so this OK--> and [[Edirne]]<!--Modern day naming, so this OK-->, can also be seen in Egypt, Eritrea, Tunisia, Algiers, the Balkans and Romania, where mosques, bridges, fountains and schools were built. The art of Ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the Ottoman Empire. The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences, such as mixing traditional [[Byzantine art]] with elements of [[Chinese art]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Eli Shah |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |title=The Ottoman Artistic Legacy |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213131926/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |archivedate=13 February 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Decorative arts ===\n[[File:Ottoman miniature painters.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman miniature painters]]\n\nThe tradition of [[Ottoman miniature]]s, painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] art form, though it also included elements of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition of [[manuscript illumination|illumination]] and painting.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A Greek academy of painters, the ''Nakkashane-i-Rum'', was established in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the ''Nakkashane-i-Irani'', was added.\n\n[[Ottoman illumination]] covers non-figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in ''[[muraqqa]]'' or albums, as opposed to the figurative images of the [[Ottoman miniature]]. It was a part of the Ottoman Book Arts together with the Ottoman miniature (''taswir''), calligraphy (''hat''), [[Islamic calligraphy]], bookbinding (''cilt'') and [[paper marbling]] (''ebru''). In the Ottoman Empire, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated and illustrated manuscripts]] were commissioned by the Sultan or the administrators of the court. In Topkapi Palace, these manuscripts were created by the artists working in ''Nakkashane'', the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists. Both religious and non-religious books could be illuminated. Also sheets for albums ''levha'' consisted of illuminated calligraphy (''hat'') of ''[[tughra]]'', religious texts, verses from poems or proverbs, and purely decorative drawings.\n\nThe art of carpet [[weaving]] was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism, and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.<ref name=\"foroqhi\">{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire|year=2005|publisher=I.B.

Turks used carpets, rugs and [[kilim]]s not just on the floors of a room, but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to [[mosques]], which often amassed large collections of them.<ref name=\"foroqhip153\">{{cite book |last=Faroqhi |first=Suraiya |title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire |edition=New |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

A number of the Ottoman sultans were accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as [[Selim III]], whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of [[Byzantine music]], [[Armenian music]], [[Arabic music]], and [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]. Compositionally, it is organised around rhythmic units called [[Usul (music)|usul]], which are somewhat similar to [[Metre (music)|meter]] in Western music, and [[Melody|melodic]] units called [[makam]], which bear some resemblance to Western [[musical mode]]s.\n\nThe [[Musical instrument|instruments]] used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the [[baglama|saz]], the [[Baglama|ba\u011flama]], the [[Kemenche|kemence]]), other Middle Eastern instruments (the [[Oud|ud]], the [[tanbur]], the [[Qanun (instrument)|kanun]], the [[ney]]), and\u2014later in the tradition\u2014Western instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music, and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of [[folk music]] were created. The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are: Balkan-Thracian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, North-Eastern ([[Laz people|Laz]]) T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Aegean T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Central Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Eastern Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, and Caucasian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs. Some of the distinctive styles were: [[Ottoman military band|Janissary Music]], [[Roma music]], [[Belly dance]], [[Turkish folk music]].\n\nThe traditional [[shadow play]] called [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire and featured characters representing all of the major ethnic and social groups in that culture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat, a Turkish shadow play |publisher=All About Turkey |date=20 November 2006 |url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/karagoz.htm |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Emin \u015eenyer |title=Karagoz, Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre |publisher=Karagoz.net |url=http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm |accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref> It was performed by a single puppet master, who voiced all of the characters, and accompanied by [[tambourine]] (''def'').

This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through [[Ramadan]] events, and through the cooking at the [[Yal\u0131]]s of the [[Pasha]]s, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.\n\nMuch of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from a shared Ottoman cuisine, especially [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], and including [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] cuisines.<ref name=\"Fragner\">Bert Fragner, \"From the Caucasus to the Roof of the World: a culinary adventure\", in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London, [[Prague]] and New York, p. 52</ref> Many common dishes in the region, descendants of the once-common Ottoman cuisine, include [[yogurt]], [[d\u00f6ner kebab]]/[[Gyro (food)|gyro]]/[[shawarma]], [[cac\u0131k]]/tzatziki, [[ayran]], [[pita]] bread, [[feta]] cheese, [[baklava]], [[lahmacun]], [[moussaka]], [[yuvarlak]], [[k\u00f6fte]]/keft\u00e9s/kofta, [[b\u00f6rek]]/boureki, [[rak\u0131]]/[[rakia]]/[[tsipouro]]/[[tsikoudia]], [[meze]], [[dolma]], [[Sarma (food)|sarma]], rice [[pilaf]], [[Turkish coffee]], [[sujuk]], [[kashk]], [[ke\u015fkek]], [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[lavash]], [[kanafeh]], and more.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{Main|Science and technology in the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Ottoman Imperial Museum (Today- Istanbul Archaeology Museums).jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman Imperial Museum, today the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]]]]\n\nOver the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts.<ref name=\"\u00c1goston and Alan Masters583\"/> A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century.
