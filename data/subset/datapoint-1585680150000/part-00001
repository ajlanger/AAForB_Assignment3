He was famed for leading a group of his captors up to the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] lines, where he then marched them to headquarters as his own prisoners.\n\nIn 1867, Captain Wynne moved to [[St. Francis County, Arkansas]], and joined the finance company of Dennis & Beck. At that time, the Dennis & Beck company held savings for other companies and for individuals, but eventually, it became the Bank of Eastern Arkansas, and Wynne became its first president.\n\nFrom 1880-85, as the St. Louis, Iron Mountain, and Southern Railroad was under construction, active steamboat riverports like [[Wittsburg, Arkansas|Wittsburg]], at that time the county seat of Cross County, were deserted for the railroads.\n\nThe location of the settlement of Wynne was first chosen in 1882, when a train derailed, leaving one boxcar without wheels and off the tracks. That boxcar was then turned upright as a building, and as a compliment to Captain Wynne, it was designated the \"Wynne Station\". On September 27, 1882, the Wynne Station Post Office was opened.\n\nWhen the east-west railroad line was completed, it crossed the north-south line near the boxcar, and the name \"Wynne Junction\" became well known in the area. On May 28, 1888, the \"Junction\" part of the name was dropped, and the town of Wynne was formed.\n\nBy the 1890s, the railroad traffic and the resulting activity in Wynne made it a more vibrant town than the town of [[Vanndale, Arkansas|Vanndale]], which had been the county seat since 1886. In 1903, the county seat of Cross County was moved to Wynne.\n\nWith the advent of the [[U.S. Numbered Highways|U.S. Highway System]] in the 1920s and 30s, [[U.S. Route 64]] was built west from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], through Wynne, and to points west. Also, the north-south [[Arkansas Highway 1]] was built through Wynne, making it an important highway crossroads for several decades, in addition to being a railroad town. Since the advent of the [[Interstate Highway System]], [[Interstate 40]] has largely diverted long-distance travel away from Wynne.\n\n==Geography==\nWynne lies in south-central Cross County at {{coord|35|13|39|N|90|47|22|W|type:city}} (35.227435, -90.789435),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> the boundary between two distinct geographical areas of Arkansas: the fertile farmland of the Arkansas Delta (which is a part of the larger [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]), and Crowley's Ridge, a distinct rise marking the [[New Madrid Seismic Zone|New Madrid Fault Line]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 64]] passes through the northern side of the city, leading east {{convert|37|mi}} to [[Marion, Arkansas|Marion]] and west {{convert|58|mi}} to [[Searcy, Arkansas|Searcy]]. [[Arkansas Highway 1]] leads north {{convert|25|mi}} to [[Harrisburg, Arkansas|Harrisburg]] and south {{convert|14|mi}} to [[Interstate 40]] at [[Forrest City, Arkansas|Forrest City]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Wynne has a total area of {{convert|23.0|km2|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|0.03|km2|disp=flip|3}}, or 0.12%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nThe town of Wynne is considered \"the city with a smile\" and displays this title proudly on their single overpass which is also painted in the school colors of blue and gold. However, the city is still largely segregated and has several railroad tracks that divide its residents that many have believed is due to race. Because of the lack of city funding and planning much of the West part of town has had little to no upkeep by the city. Consisting hugely of African-American residents, the West side of Wynne was once considered a staple of black business from the post Civil Rights era to well into the mid 90\u2019s. Community staples such as Bud Davis\u2019 Bar & Grill, Miss Anna\u2019s, Hollywood Night-Club, Club D\u2019Essence, Woodard Funeral Home, Johnson\u2019s Funeral Home, Waits BBQ, and Smith\u2019s Grocery were all beneficial in providing a steady cash flow as well as entertainment for the African-American residents of Wynne. Youth programs thrived such as Boys 2 Men/Girls 2 Women and the various black churches like Union Valley Missionary Baptist Church, First Baptist Church, St. James Church and Jones Temple COGIC all provided various scholarships for its graduating members. Around the early to mid 2000s, Wynne saw many members of the African-American community die or move to more economically developed parts of Arkansas and/or the country. This led to a drastic decline in revenue for the African-American community of Wynne that has yet to recover from.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 565\n|1900= 1629\n|1910= 2353\n|1920= 2933\n|1930= 3505\n|1940= 3633\n|1950= 4142\n|1960= 4922\n|1970= 6696\n|1980= 7927\n|1990= 8187\n|2000= 8615\n|2010= 8367\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=7871\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302111640/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=March 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov |archivedate=September 11, 2013 }}</ref> of 2000, there were 8,615 people, 3,245 households, and 2,323 families residing in the city.

He was famed for leading a group of his captors up to the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] lines, where he then marched them to headquarters as his own prisoners.\n\nIn 1867, Captain Wynne moved to [[St. Francis County, Arkansas]], and joined the finance company of Dennis & Beck. At that time, the Dennis & Beck company held savings for other companies and for individuals, but eventually, it became the Bank of Eastern Arkansas, and Wynne became its first president.\n\nFrom 1880-85, as the St. Louis, Iron Mountain, and Southern Railroad was under construction, active steamboat riverports like [[Wittsburg, Arkansas|Wittsburg]], at that time the county seat of Cross County, were deserted for the railroads.\n\nThe location of the settlement of Wynne was first chosen in 1882, when a train derailed, leaving one boxcar without wheels and off the tracks. That boxcar was then turned upright as a building, and as a compliment to Captain Wynne, it was designated the \"Wynne Station\". On September 27, 1882, the Wynne Station Post Office was opened.\n\nWhen the east-west railroad line was completed, it crossed the north-south line near the boxcar, and the name \"Wynne Junction\" became well known in the area. On May 28, 1888, the \"Junction\" part of the name was dropped, and the town of Wynne was formed.\n\nBy the 1890s, the railroad traffic and the resulting activity in Wynne made it a more vibrant town than the town of [[Vanndale, Arkansas|Vanndale]], which had been the county seat since 1886. In 1903, the county seat of Cross County was moved to Wynne.\n\nWith the advent of the [[U.S. Numbered Highways|U.S. Highway System]] in the 1920s and 30s, [[U.S. Route 64]] was built west from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], through Wynne, and to points west. Also, the north-south [[Arkansas Highway 1]] was built through Wynne, making it an important highway crossroads for several decades, in addition to being a railroad town. Since the advent of the [[Interstate Highway System]], [[Interstate 40]] has largely diverted long-distance travel away from Wynne.\n\n==Geography==\nWynne lies in south-central Cross County at {{coord|35|13|39|N|90|47|22|W|type:city}} (35.227435, -90.789435),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> the boundary between two distinct geographical areas of Arkansas: the fertile farmland of the Arkansas Delta (which is a part of the larger [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]), and Crowley's Ridge, a distinct rise marking the [[New Madrid Seismic Zone|New Madrid Fault Line]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 64]] passes through the northern side of the city, leading east {{convert|37|mi}} to [[Marion, Arkansas|Marion]] and west {{convert|58|mi}} to [[Searcy, Arkansas|Searcy]]. [[Arkansas Highway 1]] leads north {{convert|25|mi}} to [[Harrisburg, Arkansas|Harrisburg]] and south {{convert|14|mi}} to [[Interstate 40]] at [[Forrest City, Arkansas|Forrest City]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Wynne has a total area of {{convert|23.0|km2|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|0.03|km2|disp=flip|3}}, or 0.12%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nThe town of Wynne is considered \"the city with a smile\" and displays this title proudly on their single overpass which is also painted in the school colors of blue and gold. However, the city is still largely segregated and has several railroad tracks that divide its residents that many have believed is due to race. Because of the lack of city funding and planning much of the West part of town has had little to no upkeep by the city. Consisting hugely of African-American residents, the West side of Wynne was once considered a staple of black business from the post Civil Rights era to well into the mid 90\u2019s. Community staples such as Bud Davis\u2019 Bar & Grill, Miss Anna\u2019s, Hollywood Night-Club, Club D\u2019Essence, Woodard Funeral Home, Johnson\u2019s Funeral Home, Waits BBQ, and Smith\u2019s Grocery were all beneficial in providing a steady cash flow as well as entertainment for the African-American residents of Wynne. Youth programs thrived such as Boys 2 Men/Girls 2 Women and the various black churches like Union Valley Missionary Baptist Church, First Baptist Church, St. James Church and Jones Temple COGIC all provided various scholarships for its graduating members. Around the early to mid 2000\u2019s, Wynne saw many members of the African-American community die or move to more economically developed parts of Arkansas and/or the country. This led to a drastic decline in revenue for the African-American community of Wynne that has yet to recover from.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 565\n|1900= 1629\n|1910= 2353\n|1920= 2933\n|1930= 3505\n|1940= 3633\n|1950= 4142\n|1960= 4922\n|1970= 6696\n|1980= 7927\n|1990= 8187\n|2000= 8615\n|2010= 8367\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=7871\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302111640/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=March 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov |archivedate=September 11, 2013 }}</ref> of 2000, there were 8,615 people, 3,245 households, and 2,323 families residing in the city.
