By the mid-2010s, the style of vocals popular in indie pop have become immensely widespread among pop instrumentalists as they are commonly used by younger artists, like [[Selena Gomez]], [[Lana Del Rey]], [[Lorde]] and [[Birdy (singer)|Birdy]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/reggieugwu/what-is-indie-pop-voice | title=Selena Gomez's \"Good For You\" And The Rise Of \"Indie Pop Voice\" | date=6 October 2015 | publisher=Buzzfeed | first=Reggie | last=Ugwu | accessdate=11 April 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412013252/https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/reggieugwu/what-is-indie-pop-voice | archive-date=12 April 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Traditional instruments]], such as the mandolin, dulcimer, ukulele, bongos, banjo, and accordion, have been used more often, especially by indie rock musicians and singer-songwriters, including [[Mumford and Sons]], [[Vance Joy]], [[Phillip Phillips]], and [[The Lumineers]], along with country players, such as [[Chris Stapleton]] and [[Zac Brown Band]].\n\nThe Mid to Late 2010s saw the emergence of [[Bash music]], a drum-based genre influenced by rock, folk, blues, and soul. It typically features folk stomping, hard hitting drums, and soulful vocals. Artists such as [[Imagine Dragons]], [[X Ambassadors]], [[Rag'n'Bone Man]], [[Kaleo (band)|Kaleo]], [[Dean Lewis]], [[The Score (band)|The Score]], [[The Unlikely Candidates]], [[American Authors]], [[Barns Courtney]], [[Dorothy (band)|Dorothy,]] [[K.Flay]], [[Matt Maeson]], [[Morgxn]], Oh The Larceny, Zayde W\u00f8lf and [[Bishop Briggs]] have incorporated these elements in their work.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQPxgtVLJkihoMxkOWg3fbWI32jgJ1yUB|title=Alternative 2020 (Bash Music)|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 2010s, [[hip hop music]] grew as a genre.

In the decade movements like [[Trap music (hip hop)|Trap music]], [[Cloud rap]], [[Drill music]], and [[Emo hip hop]] became mainstream. The 2010s are also notable for the increasing prominence of rap producers; examples being [[Young Chop]], [[Sonny Digital]], [[DJ Mustard]], [[Metro Boomin]] and [[DJ Khaled]].\n\n[[Progressive Rock|Progressive]] and [[Experimental Rock|experimental rock]] have started to become widespread, mainly in the second half of the decade. Artists, such as [[Nothing More]], [[Highly Suspect]], [[Twelve Foot Ninja]], [[Dead Letter Circus]], and [[Marmozets]], and DIY ethic bands, including Bad Omens, Sylar, \u00c6ges, and Silver Snakes, have enjoyed success through concerts and streaming services.\n\n[[Electronic dance music|EDM]] had become more mainstream due to the releases of [[Britney Spears]]' ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' and [[Kanye West]]'s \"[[Stronger (Kanye West song)|Stronger]]\"; some 2010s successes include [[David Guetta]], [[Skrillex]], [[Steve Aoki]], [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Headhunterz]], [[Wildstylez]], Da Tweekaz, [[Clean Bandit]], [[Major Lazer]], [[DVBBS]], [[Avicii]], [[Alesso]], [[Owl City]], [[The Chainsmokers]], [[Calvin Harris]], [[DJ Snake]], [[Diplo]], [[ShockOne]], [[Drumsound & Bassline Smith]], [[Blasterjaxx]], [[Martin Garrix]], [[Marshmello]], [[Alan Walker (music producer)|Alan Walker]] and [[Zedd]].\n\nThe genres of [[Europop]] and [[Eurodance]] have also achieved notable commercial success, evidenced by Swedish producer Max Martin's ubiquity in the decade's most successful pop albums. [[Katy Perry]]'s ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' (2010) drew heavily from this style and became the first album by a female artist in history to release five number one U.S. singles. Europop and electronica were used more extensively in the early 2010s as a result of the success of disk jockeys, like [[David Guetta]] and [[Calvin Harris]], also influencing the work of female solo acts like [[Rihanna]], [[Lady Gaga]], and [[Kesha]]. Some of the best-selling songs of the decade, including \"[[Only Girl (In the World)]]\" and \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\" by [[Rihanna]], were strongly influenced by Eurodance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 2012, a large number of songs by American instrumentalists featured quintessential Eurodance elements, especially synthesizer and strong beats during the [[Refrain|chorus]] mixed with rapping or vocals for verses. [[Flo Rida]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[LMFAO]], and [[The Black Eyed Peas]] were popular hip house acts from the early half of the 2010s.\n\n[[Teen pop]] had made a significant comeback throughout the decade, with the likes of [[Demi Lovato]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Ariana Grande]] Like their predecessors, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake, who rose to fame in the late 90s and early 2000s, most of these stars were exclusively associated or with [[Disney Channel]] and [[Nickelodeon]] at the genesis of careers.  An exception is Canadian artist Justin Bieber who rose fame through [[YouTube]] and social media. Throughout the 2010s, they have expanded control over their careers and come of age with their music to varying degrees of success, and many teen pop musicians outside the former companies have continued to launch promising careers throughout the 2010s.\n\nSince 2011, boy bands and girl groups have returned to mainstream popularity for the first time after the early 2000s, with the most popular examples being British-Irish boy band [[One Direction]] and American boy band [[Big Time Rush (band)|Big Time Rush]]. A new generation of successful girl groups was ushered in by acts such as [[Little Mix]] and [[Fifth Harmony]]. In addition to this, [[K-Pop]] groups, benefitting from high visibility on Social Media and Video sharing sites like [[YouTube]], began to capitalise on their viral power and monetise netizen fanbases overseas conducting sell out tours in western markets during the mid-2010s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7654354/kpop-concerts-live-hyuna-got7|title=K-Pop Concerts In 2017: GOT7, B1A4, HyunA & More Are Coming to America|website=Billboard|access-date=25 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601062126/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7654354/kpop-concerts-live-hyuna-got7|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Korean acts such as BIGBANG, EXO, and BTS sold out US tours with little to no promotion or support from mainstream media sources like TV & Radio Airplay.\n\nSoundtracks from films have topped the charts this decade as well, with number 1 singles from [[Lady Gaga]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Wiz Khalifa]], [[Charlie Puth]], [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[Pharrell Williams]], along with top 10 entries by [[The Weeknd]], [[Ellie Goulding]], and others.\n\n[[Dubstep]] and [[drumstep]] became widespread subgenres in the early 2010s on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, especially in its native [[United Kingdom]].

In particular, English rock instrumentalist [[David Bowie]] experienced his most commercially successful period since the 1980s with two U.S. top 5 albums, ''[[The Next Day]]'' (2013) and ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]'' (2016), the latter being released shortly before his death.\n[[File:Imagine Dragons - Ilosaarirock 2013 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Imagine Dragons]] were an instant success after the release of their  debut album, ''[[Night Visions]]''.]]\n[[File:Vampire Weekend Red Rocks 05.20.13.jpg|thumb|[[Vampire Weekend]] followed up their debut album with two number 1 albums in 2010 and 2013.]]\n\n==== Alternative rock ====\n\nAlthough its subgenre, [[indie rock]], was in the spotlight during the 2010s, successful alternative rock bands in this decade were [[Imagine Dragons]], [[Linkin Park]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Coldplay]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Weezer]], [[Kasabian]], [[Thirty Seconds To Mars]], [[Kongos (band)|Kongos]], [[Cage The Elephant]], [[Evanescence]], [[Metric (band)|Metric]], [[Nickelback]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Three Days Grace]], [[The War on Drugs (band)|The War On Drugs]], [[Green Day]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Queens Of The Stone Age]], [[Panic! at the Disco]], [[Kaleo (band)|Kaleo]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Blink-182]], [[Twenty One Pilots]], [[Radiohead]], [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], [[Death from Above (band)|Death from Above 1979]], [[Paramore]], [[Biffy Clyro]], and [[Nothing But Thieves]]. All of these bands had had albums debut in the top 5. With [[Fall Out Boy]] scoring 3 number 1 albums in a row on the [[Billboard 200]] album chart in 2013, 2015, and 2018.\n\n==== Psychedelic rock ====\nThe decade had seen the revival of [[psychedelic rock]] as a popular subgenre for the first time since the 1970s. Bands of the decade had introduced synths and electronic sounds into the genre for the first time. Techniques seen in other genres such as [[Shoegaze]] were also employed to create walls of sound and distortion. Popular acts of the genre in the decade had been [[Animal Collective]], [[Tame Impala]], [[Unknown Mortal Orchestra]], [[Mac DeMarco]], [[The War on Drugs (band)|The War on Drugs]], [[Ariel Pink]], [[Connan Mockasin]], [[Homeshake]], [[King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard]], [[Thee Oh Sees]], [[Pond (Australian band)|Pond]], [[Temples (band)|Temples]], [[MGMT]], [[Allah-Las]], [[Ty Segall]], [[Samsara Blues Experiment]] and [[The Black Angels (band)|The Black Angels]].\n\n==== Progressive and experimental rock ====\nA huge renaissance in [[progressive rock]] occurred in the 2010s. One of the key forms of progressive music in the early 2010s was [[djent]]. It was influenced by mathematically driven metal from the previous decade, particularly [[Meshuggah]]. Guitarists such as [[Misha Mansoor]], Justin Lowe, and [[Tosin Abasi]] made use of [[seven-string guitar|seven-string]], [[eight-string guitar|eight-string]], and [[nine-string guitar]]s and mainly relied on [[polyrhythm]]s, [[palm-muting]], and [[syncopation|syncopated]] guitar riffs, as well as melodic guitar solos. Some of the most popular and influential djent bands were [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]], [[After the Burial]], [[Animals as Leaders]], [[Tesseract (band)|Tesseract]] and [[Born of Osiris]]. Djent's popularity led to more bands including more mathematical elements in their music with it eventually leading to elements in mainstream pop music.\n\nAnother form of progressive rock in this decade was [[post-progressive]], which drew influences from bands such as [[Radiohead]] and [[Porcupine Tree]] from the 2000s. This genre relies far more on simple melodic patterns combined with complex structure, texture and harmonies to create deep, emotionally driven, musical journeys in an effort to return the genre to its roots and make it relevant in the decade. Some newer progressive rock bands that were considered a part of this renaissance were [[Haken (band)|Haken]], [[Leprous]], [[Riverside (band)|Riverside]], [[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]], and [[iamthemorning]]. In addition, the 2010s also saw the return of some older artists including [[Opeth]], [[Devin Townsend]], [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]], and [[Steven Wilson]], who had a mainstream breakthrough with his studio albums ''[[Hand. Cannot. Erase.]]'' and ''[[To the Bone (Steven Wilson album)|To the Bone]]''. In 2019, [[Tool (band)|Tool]] experienced a major comeback with their first studio album in 13 years, ''[[Fear Inoculum]]''.\n\nIn the later part of the decade, this revival led to progressive rock crossing over with an indie-and-metal approach which became popular. Many of these bands are diverse in sound, and are influenced by genres like [[post-hardcore]], [[math rock]], and [[post-rock]] music. Artists making successful albums were part of this genre, like [[Nothing More]], [[Being as an Ocean]], [[Circa Survive]], [[Highly Suspect]], [[Dredg]], [[The Color Morale]], [[Twelve Foot Ninja]], [[The Mars Volta]], [[Hands Like Houses]], [[Code Orange (band)|Code Orange]], [[Sleepwave]], [[Dayshell]], [[Sworn in]], [[Dead Letter Circus]], [[Thank You Scientist]], [[Turbowolf]], [[Letlive]], [[Marmozets]], [[Black Map]], [[Biffy Clyro]], [[Night Verses]], [[Thrice]], [[The Word Alive]], [[Dance Gavin Dance]], [[Shining (Norwegian band)|Shining]], [[Mutoid Man]], [[Arcane Roots]] and [[A Perfect Circle]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==== Pop punk and punk rock ====\nWith a few exceptions (including [[Green Day]], [[The Offspring]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Paramore]], [[Blink-182]] and [[Panic! at the Disco]]), [[pop punk]] had heavily decreased in mainstream popularity during the 2010s and had not been enjoying popular success as it once did in the late 1990s and early 2000s. [[Emo]], which had gained heavy widespread success between 2004 and 2008, had heavily declined in popularity by the early 2010s with the 2013 Breakup of [[My Chemical Romance]] being a likely factor of that. Early 1990s punk rock bands, like [[Bad Religion]], [[NOFX]], and [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], had not had mainstream success since the 1990s or 2000s but still enjoyed heavy touring. Second wave pop punk acts, such as [[Good Charlotte]], [[Sum 41]], [[Simple Plan]], and [[New Found Glory]] had heavily declined in popularity. However, [[DIY ethic]] punk rock had seen somewhat of a cult resurgence with bands, including [[Martha (band)|Martha]], [[The Spook School (band)|The Spook School]], [[Neck Deep]], [[The Story So Far (band)|The Story So Far]], and [[Joanna Gruesome]], growing in popularity and being played on radio stations, like [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]. Garage punk bands such as [[Wavves]], [[FIDLAR]], [[PUP (band)|PUP]], [[Best Coast]], [[The Growlers]], [[Bass Drum of Death]], [[The Garden (band)|The Garden]], [[Ty Segall]], [[Cherry Glazerr]], and [[Thee Oh Sees]] had gained popularity, especially in Southern California. Many of these garage punk bands had signed to [[Burger Records]], who are known for their DIY style ethos and releasing albums on [[cassette tape]].\n\n==== Hard rock and heavy metal ====\n[[File:Peace and Love A Day to Remember 1.JPG|thumb|A Day to Remember was one of the most successful hard rock bands of the 2010s.]]\n\nDuring the 2010s, popular hard rock and heavy metal bands, such as [[Five Finger Death Punch]], [[Avenged Sevenfold]], [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], [[Asking Alexandria]], [[Breaking Benjamin]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Shinedown]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[A Day to Remember (band)|A Day to Remember]], [[Royal Blood (band)|Royal Blood]], [[Ghost (Swedish band)|Ghost]], [[Halestorm]], [[Volbeat]], [[Papa Roach]], [[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle]], [[Black Veil Brides]], [[Nothing More]], [[Parkway Drive]], [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]], and [[Seether]], had released successful albums. With many newer hard rock and heavy metal acts from this decade getting more success (especially with the streaming service success of progressive and experimental rock and metal music), the decade had also seen the return of older hard rock and heavy metal acts; some of which include bands that were previously on hiatus, or had not achieved mainstream popularity in years, like [[Soundgarden]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Deftones]], [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Slayer]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Faith No More]], [[Dream Theater]] and [[Metal Church]]. [[Guns N' Roses]] also experienced a major comeback during the mid-to-late 2010s with the [[Not in This Lifetime... Tour]], which saw a reunion of three-fifths of their classic lineup ([[Axl Rose]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Duff McKagan]]), all of whom last performed live together in 1993, and went on to become one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade.\n\n[[Thrash metal]] was not as popular in the 2010s as it was during the 1980s and early-to-mid-1990s, when the genre declined in popularity, due to the rising success of [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock|alternative]] music. However, the decade had seen several veteran thrash metal bands continue to maintain considerable popularity in the United States, particularly on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Each of \"[[The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria|the big four]]\" of the genre ([[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]) released albums that debuted on the top five or top ten on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref>{{cite web |title=Metallica's 'Hardwired...

Slow jams had largely been replaced by dance numbers and pop ballads. Contemporary R&B had begun to influence hipster musicians, creating a new genre called alternative R&B. New players had emerged from this subgenre, like [[The Weeknd]], [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], [[Dev Hynes|Blood Orange]], [[SZA (singer)|SZA]], [[The Internet (band)|The Internet]], [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Kali Uchis]], [[Syd (singer)|Syd]], [[How to Dress Well]], [[Kilo Kish]], [[Sampha]], [[Lion Babe]], [[Jhene Aiko]], [[Normani]], [[Frank Ocean]], [[Ravyn Lenae]], [[Kehlani]], [[Tinashe]], [[Sabrina Claudio]], [[H.E.R.]], [[Tory Lanez]], [[Gallant (singer)|Gallant]], [[Daniel Caesar]], [[King (R&B group)|King]], [[Moses Sumney]], [[Kelela]], [[dvsn]], [[Jorja Smith]], [[PartyNextDoor]], [[Jeremih]], [[Khalid (singer)|Khalid]], [[Bryson Tiller]], and [[Ella Mai]].\n\nA few top mainstream contemporary R&B artists of the 2010s were [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Chris Brown]], [[Usher (singer)|Usher]], [[Rihanna]], [[Bruno Mars]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[The Weeknd]], [[Trey Songz]], [[Miguel (singer)|Miguel]], [[Bryson Tiller]], [[Alicia Keys]], and [[John Legend]]. There was also a slight revival of soul during the early 2010s, with instrumentalists, such as [[Cee Lo Green]], [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]], and [[Adele]].\n\nDue to the domination of electro and dance-pop, contemporary R&B had partially become more influenced by dance and electropop, and many musicians that were typically contemporary R&B artists had started to release pop. This is notable in players, including Ne-Yo, Usher, Chris Brown, and Rihanna with songs, like \"Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)\" and \"Forever Now,\" \"Scream\" and \"OMG,\" \"Don't Wake Me Up\" and \"Turn Up The Music,\" and \"We Found Love\" and \"Where Have You Been.\" A form of R&B, [[dancehall]], also became popular on the charts in the mid to late 2010s with songs such as \"[[Lean On]]\" by [[Major Lazer]], \"[[One Dance]]\" by [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], and [[Work (Rihanna song)|Work]] by [[Rihanna]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7616664/dancehall-charts-producers|title=Meet the Producers Who Brought Dancehall Back to the Charts In 2016|website=Billboard|access-date=13 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422191448/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7616664/dancehall-charts-producers|archive-date=22 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a resurgence of contemporary R&B acts from the 1990s and 2000s to achieve commercial success during the 2010s, such as [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], [[Kelly Rowland]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Maxwell (singer)|Maxwell]], [[D'Angelo]], and [[Janet Jackson]].\n\nWhile some contemporary R&B artists transitioned to a more dance and electropop sound, many artists still achieved success while still remaining true to contemporary R&B. Songs, including \"Everything to Me\" by Monica, \"Refill\" by Elle Varner, \"Thinking Bout You\" by Frank Ocean, \"Motivation\" by Kelly Rowland, \"Put It Down\" by Brandy, and \"No Sleeep\" by Janet Jackson, are notable for being contemporary R&B and popular hits while still obtaining an authentic contemporary R&B sound.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 became the first artist in Billboard chart history to have her first six albums debut at number-one on the Billboard 200 chart in 2016. Additionally, Beyonc\u00e9 also became the first artist to place 12 tracks from one album within the Hot 100 simultaneously. Continuing her success from the 90s and 2000s, Beyonc\u00e9 received the Billboard Millennium Award at the [[2011 Billboard Music Awards]], the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award]] at the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards]], the Fashion Icon Award from the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]] in 2016, and a [[Peabody Award]] for her universally acclaimed sixth studio album ''[[Lemonade (Beyonc\u00e9 album)|Lemonade]]'' in 2017. In 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 surpassed Madonna as the most-awarded artist at the MTV Video Music Awards (24 wins).

Most successful \"SoundCloud rappers\" might not release all their music on the platform opting instead for streaming services [[Apple Music]] and [[Spotify]] but are still categorized as \"SoundCloud rappers\" or \"Internet\"/\"Underground rappers\" due to their aesthetics, sonics, come up on the platform and collaborations with other rappers and producers in the scene. It is characterized as simplistic, bass heavy beats, often with hazy, lo-fi or shimmering sounding melodies or samples, paired with lyrics that ping-pong between braggadocio and nihilism, with lots of sex and odes to heavy narcotics. The subgenre began to start seeing mainstream popularity in the mid 2010s and takes sonic and aesthetic inspiration from the [[Trap music (EDM)|trap]], [[Drill music|drill]], [[Cloud Rap]], and internet rap scenes that began in the late 2000s and early 2010s on websites such as [[DatPiff]] and rap blogs with artists such as [[Gucci Mane]], [[Lil B]], [[Odd Future]], [[Young Thug]], [[Max B]], [[Lil Ugly Mane]], [[A$AP Mob]], [[SpaceGhostPurrp]] and [[Chief Keef]]. The subgenre was met with some criticism for having less emphasis on lyricism, and the problematic nature of the artists to arise from it, such as Lil Peep's drug abuse that led to his death, the multiple assault charges to XXXTentacion, and the murder charges on Tay-K.  Influential SoundCloud rappers include [[Kodak Black]], [[Yung Bans]], [[Lil Peep]], [[Lil Pump]], [[Lil Uzi Vert]], [[Travis Scott]], Uno The Activist, [[Lil Yachty]], [[Smokepurpp]], [[Tay-K]], [[Ski Mask the Slump God]], ThouxanBanFauni, [[XXXTentacion]], [[21 Savage]], [[6ix9ine]], [[Trippie Redd]], [[Denzel Curry]], [[Lucki]], Warhol.ss, [[Maxo Kream]], Young Nudy, [[Ugly God]], [[Playboi Carti]], Rico Nasty, [[Lil Tracy]], and [[Juice WRLD]].\n\n==== Trap ====\n[[Trap music]] is a style of [[Southern hip hop]] and [[gangsta rap]] that was developed in the late 1990s to early 2000s in the [[Southern United States]].<ref name=\"gq\">{{cite web|last=Phili|first=Stelios|title=Fighting Weight: From the Trap to the Treadmill|url=https://www.gq.com/how-to/rest-of-your-life/201210/dj-scream-trap-music-playlist#slide=1|work=[[GQ]]|accessdate=30 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160816120338/https://www.gq.com/how-to/rest-of-your-life/201210/dj-scream-trap-music-playlist#slide=1|archivedate=16 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=dj-mag>{{cite web|title=The trap phenomenon explained|url=http://djmag.com/content/trap-music-under-lock-key|publisher=[[DJ Magazine|DJ Mag]]|accessdate=30 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723021444/http://djmag.com/content/trap-music-under-lock-key|archivedate=23 July 2013}}</ref> It is typified by [[double-time|double]] or triple-time sub-divided [[hi-hat]]s,<ref name=\"jgenrechar\">{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/2012/6/11/quit-screwing-with-trap-music-an-interview-with-houston-born-producer-l%C5%8Dtic--2|title=Quit Screwing with Trap Music: An Interview with Houston-Born Producer L\u014dtic|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=11 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103061941/http://motherboard.vice.com/2012/6/11/quit-screwing-with-trap-music-an-interview-with-houston-born-producer-l%C5%8Dtic--2|archivedate=3 November 2012}}</ref> heavy, sub-bass layered [[kick drum]]s from the [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine, layered [[synthesizer]]s and an overall dark, ominous or bleak atmosphere and lyrical content.<ref name=\"cr\">{{cite web|last=Raymer|first=Miles|title=Who owns trap?|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/trap-rap-edm-flosstradamus-uz-jeffrees-lex-luger/Content?oid=7975249|publisher=[[Chicago Reader]]|accessdate=30 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527094836/http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/trap-rap-edm-flosstradamus-uz-jeffrees-lex-luger/Content?oid=7975249|archivedate=27 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"topman\">{{cite web|title=Trap Music: The Definitive Guide|url=http://magazine.topman.com/category/ctrl-music/trap-music-the-definitive-guide/|accessdate=14 February 2013|author=Joseph Patterson|publisher=Topman.

In the 2010s, artists crossbred trap with [[dubstep]] to create [[trap music (EDM)|trap EDM]]. It also influenced [[Latin trap]] music.\n\nProminent rappers of the trap music subgenre during the 2010s include [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[2 Chainz]], [[Migos]], [[Young Thug]], [[21 Savage]], [[Kodak Black]], [[Cardi B]], [[Nasty C]] and [[Lil Baby]], among several others. Trap music during the 2010s also helped record producers rise to prominence such as [[Mike Will Made It]], [[Lex Luger (record producer)|Lex Luger]], [[Southside (record producer)|Southside]], [[Metro Boomin]], [[London on da Track]], and more.\n\n=== Electronic ===\n[[File:Skrillex Ottawa Bluesfest.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Grammy Award]]-winning [[Skrillex]], in 2011]]\n\nWhile dance music had periodically conquered the American pop charts, its current incursion had most likely been its deepest since the disco heyday of the 1970s. Throughout the 2010s, various [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]] subgenres had conquered the music scene, such as [[house music|house]], [[dubstep]], [[drumstep]], [[hardstyle]], [[Electro House|electro house]], [[techno]], [[trance music|trance]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]], and [[Trap music (EDM)|trap]]. These genres have many musical influences from 1970s' [[disco]], 1980s' [[hi-NRG]], [[spacesynth]], [[Italo disco]], and [[new wave music|new wave]], and 1990s' and 2000s' [[Eurodance]], [[techno]], [[House music|house]], [[trip hop]], [[Europop]], [[garage rock]], and [[trance music|trance]]. The rise of electronic dance had brought massive success to large festivals, raves, technoparades, algoraves, doofs, and teknivals that mostly take place in the United States and Europe though every year thousands of electronic focused music festivals are held throughout the world. These events are also well known for their long association with the use of recreational drugs, including [[MDMA]], [[LSD]], [[2C-B]], [[Ketamine]], and [[Benzylpiperazine]]. The top mainstream [[Disc jockey|disk jockeys]] in the 2010s were [[Tiesto]], [[David Guetta]], [[Calvin Harris]], [[Steve Aoki]], [[Nicky Romero]], [[Afrojack]], [[Deadmau5]], [[Diplo]], [[Skrillex]], [[Armin Van Buuren]], [[Avicii]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]], [[Martin Garrix]], [[Hardwell]], [[The Chainsmokers]], [[Marshmello]], [[Major Lazer]], [[DJ Snake]], [[Slushii]], and [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]].\n\n=== Country ===\n[[File:Taylor Swift Red Tour 2, 2013.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Taylor Swift]] is one of the most successful country artists of the 2010s.

The most popular country acts during this decade were [[Zac Brown Band]], [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Jason Aldean]], [[The Band Perry]], [[Keith Urban]], [[Luke Bryan]], [[Blake Shelton]], [[Lady Antebellum]], [[Tim Mcgraw|Tim McGraw]], [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], [[Brantley Gilbert]], [[Eric Church]], [[Dierks Bentley]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Thomas Rhett]], [[Cole Swindell]], [[Rascal Flatts]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Jake Owen]], [[Dustin Lynch]], [[Kip Moore]], [[Little Big Town]], [[Chris Young (musician)|Chris Young]], [[Hunter Hayes]], [[Cam]], [[Sam Hunt (musician)|Sam Hunt]], [[Lee Brice]], [[Eli Young Band]], [[Darius Rucker]], [[Randy Houser]], [[Kelsea Ballerini]], [[Maren Morris]], [[Billy Currington]], [[Tyler Farr]], [[Brett Eldredge]], [[Sturgill Simpson]], [[Chris Stapleton]], [[Luke Combs]], [[Kane Brown]], and [[Brett Young (singer)|Brett Young]].\n\nA large number of duos and vocal groups had begun to emerge on the charts during the 2010s, many of which feature close harmony in the lead vocals, a style that roots as far back as the 1940s and 1950s with acts, like The Shelton Brothers, Delmore Brothers, and [[Everly Brothers]]. It saw a resurgence in the 1980s with [[The Judds]] and [[The Bellamy Brothers]] although the more recent acts tend to not be related. Examples of successful duos were [[Florida Georgia Line]], [[Love and Theft (duo)|Love and Theft]], [[Dan + Shay]], The Howboy Catts, and [[Thompson Square]]. In addition to Lady Antebellum, bands, such as The Band Perry, Gloriana, Eli Young Band, and Zac Brown Band had come to occupy a large portion of the new, popular country players. Meanwhile, artists who began their careers as far back as the 1960s and 1970s had continued to be active, including [[Willie Nelson]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]], [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], [[George Strait]], and [[Reba McEntire]].\n\nIn September 2016, \"[[Forever Country]],\" a medley of three classic country songs \u2013 \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]],\" \"[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]\" and \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\"\u2014was recorded to honor the [[50th Annual Country Music Association Awards]]. A celebration of traditional country music and the genre's ongoing popularity, the song blended together 30 stars, ranging from newcomers to veteran to classic stars and acts of the genre. A similar medley, featuring many of the same stars that performed on \"Forever Country\" but with different songs, was performed at the CMA Awards. Both performances received widespread critical acclaim.\n\n==== Hip hop's influence on country ====\nSeveral popular country songs have taken influence from 21st-century hip hop, rock, and pop and have had themes of partying, attractive young women, blue jeans, Southern rock, and pickup trucks. These characteristics are typical in an unofficial subgenre known as [[bro-country]]. Instrumentalists embracing this trend were Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, Eric Church, Florida Georgia Line, Brantley Gilbert, and several others, with songs, like \"[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]],\" \"[[That's My Kind of Night]],\" and Blake Shelton's \"[[Boys 'Round Here]]\" having been the most widespread songs in terms of sales and downloads. While many of the themes of bro-country songs -\u2013 in particular, women and alcohol \u2013- have always been a part of country, the new genre came under fire by listeners, music reviewers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/soundposts/2014/03/04/women-edged-out-by-bro-country-party-song-trend/ |title=Women edged out by \u2018bro-country\u2019 party song trend? |date=4 March 2014 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=24 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105202/http://blogs.seattletimes.com/soundposts/2014/03/04/women-edged-out-by-bro-country-party-song-trend/ |archive-date=31 May 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> and classic country musicians, such as [[Alan Jackson]] and [[Gary Allan]],<ref name=\"smith\">{{cite web |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2013/10/01/country-music-identity-crisis/ |title=How country music went crazy: A comprehensive timeline of the genre's identity crisis |last=Smith |first=Grady |date=1 October 2013 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=24 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214201459/http://music-mix.ew.com/2013/10/01/country-music-identity-crisis/ |archive-date=14 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> and was satirized in the song \"[[Girl in a Country Song]]\" by the duo [[Maddie & Tae]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/maddie-tae-fire-a-shot-at-bro-country-20140715 |title=Maddie & Tae Fire a Shot at 'Bro Country' |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=23 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923145811/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/maddie-tae-fire-a-shot-at-bro-country-20140715 |archive-date=23 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The shifting styles also played a role in a brief feud between Shelton and country legend [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] in 2013, just months before Price's death, after Shelton remarked that \"Nobody wants to listen to their grandpa\u2019s music\" and that younger consumers weren't buying or downloading classic country music because the styles and sounds of songs from the past didn't appeal to them. Price \u2013- who, unlike several of his peers, usually kept quiet in the debate on classic country vs. more modern music \u2013- expressed his disapproval via his Facebook page, stating that it was their styles and success that helped make newer stars' careers possible and paved the way to modern country music. Shelton later retracted his statement, and Price accepted his apology.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nIn March 2019, the song \"[[Old Town Road]],\" a song performed by American rap artist [[Lil Nas X]] (born Montero Hill), began gaining popularity with country music fans, particularly after a remix of the song featuring vocals by [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] was released earlier in the year. The song combined elements of [[country rap]], [[hip hop]], [[Southern hip hop]] and [[trap music|trap]], and used themes of horseback riding and culture clash with urban America in its lyrics. The song became the first to chart on all three of the major ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts \u2013 [[Hot 100]], [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] and Hot Country Songs \u2013 in nearly 60 years, charting at No. 19 on the country chart. However, one week after its debut on the country chart, ''Billboard'' removed the song from the chart, disqualifying the song on the grounds that it did not fit the [[Country music|country]] genre.<ref name=\"RS\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-810844/|title=Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road' Was a Country Hit.

[[Mindy McCready]], a rising star of the late 1990s whose personal problems soon overshadowed her music, committed suicide during early 2013. [[Glen Campbell]], a vastly influential country guitarist and vocalist from the 1960s onward, was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] in late 2010 and consequently retired from show business in 2013; he died in 2017. [[Randy Travis]], a neo-traditionalist star who helped revive the genre in the mid-to-late 1980s, had several run-ins with the law in 2012 and in 2013 suffered a massive stroke. Troy Gentry of [[Montgomery Gentry]], one of the genre's most popular duos, was killed in a helicopter crash in 2017. Also in 2017, 58 concertgoers at the [[Route 91 Harvest]] festival event in Las Vegas, Nevada \u2013 where Jason Aldean was performing at the time gunfire broke out \u2013 were killed in [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|a mass shooting]]; Aldean escaped the incident uninjured and a week later paid tribute to the victims on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.\n\nProminent [[classic country]] players who had died during the decade, besides Glen Campbell, were [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]], [[Kitty Wells]], [[Patti Page]], [[Jack Greene]], [[Slim Whitman]], [[George Jones]], Ray Price, [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Lynn Anderson]], [[Jim Ed Brown]], [[Sonny James]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Jean Shepard]], [[Don Williams]], [[Mel Tillis]], [[Freddie Hart]], [[Roy Clark]], [[Dave & Sugar|Dave Rowland]] (lead singer of the 1970s trio Dave and Sugar), [[Earl Thomas Conley]] and all three of the [[Tompall & the Glaser Brothers|Glaser Brothers]] ([[Tompall Glaser|Tompall]] in 2013, and brothers [[Jim Glaser|Jim]] and Chuck in 2019). Besides Mindy McCready and Troy Gentry, several performers from the 1990s and later who were popular with audiences also died: [[Kevin Sharp]], [[Lari White]] and [[Daryle Singletary]]. Also, [[Glenn Frey]], a member of [[The Eagles|Eagles]], a rock band whose style has been vastly influential in country from the 1970s onward, died during the decade. Additionally, longtime radio personality [[Bob Kingsley]], who presented many of the above-mentioned classic artists' songs during his tenures hosting the radio programs ''[[American Country Countdown]]'' and ''[[Bob Kingsley's Country Top 40]]'', died in the fall of 2019, shortly after revealing his diagnosis of cancer.<ref>\"Bob Kingsley Dies At Age 80,\" All Access Music Group, October 17, 2019.

Bands like [[Two Door Cinema Club]], [[Foals (band)|Foals]], and [[Bombay Bicycle Club]], which emerged in the late 2000s, had succeeded in the album chart. The genre had had a stronger presence album-wise, with acts such as [[The 1975]], [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]], [[alt-J]], and [[The Vaccines]] enjoying success. [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]] had scored two number 2 singles on the UK chart, with their sound bordering on mainstream pop music in the charts. [[Royal Blood (band)|Royal Blood]] was the first band formed during the decade to win a [[Brit award|Brit Award]] for the best British group in 2014, only one year after forming. Royal Blood's sound is similar to 2000s garage rock, and they received positive reviews upon the release of their debut album.\n\nEuropean rock had also seen the return of successful instrumentalists from the past. [[David Bowie]]-in particular had two UK number 1 albums\u2014''The Next Day'' and ''Blackstar''. Upon its release, ''[[The Next Day]]'' (2013) became Bowie's most successful album in 30 years, followed by ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]'' (2016).\n\nActs, including [[Tribes (band)|Tribes]], [[White Lies (band)|White Lies]], [[The Maccabees (band)|The Maccabees]], [[Miles Kane]] and [[Hard-Fi]], had also witnessed success, mostly exclusive to the album chart.\n\n[[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] and [[hard rock]] had been seeing a relatively increased presence in the UK albums chart, thanks to releases by [[Bullet For My Valentine]] and [[Enter Shikari]]. Many new British heavy metal bands are seeing worldwide success after years of American dominance, primarily [[Bring Me the Horizon]] and [[Asking Alexandria]], although the latter entirely moved to the U.S. in 2009.

French singer [[Zaz (singer)|Zaz]] was one of very few singers to have become internationally mainstream since [[Vanessa Paradis]]. The girlbands also had success, one of them being the winners of the eighth season of [[The X Factor]], [[Little Mix]].\n\n=== Electronic ===\n[[Dubstep]] and [[drumstep]] started to become popular by 2010. This was particularly true in Britain, where it evolved from [[UK garage|UK Garage]], a genre that became widespread during the early 2000s. [[DJ Snake]] is known for having introduced [[Trap music (EDM)|trap]] into the mainstream in Europe during 2013. [[Eurodance]]-which has been consistently popular in Europe since the early 1990s-had become popular outside Europe, in a more modern style than the first wave into North America in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Australian radio station [[Triple J]] had played a large role in promoting new Australian music, especially through the [[Triple J Hottest 100]], a worldwide public poll on each individual's favourite music from each given year. During 2010, Australian pop instrumentalists to feature substantially in the countdown were [[Birds of Tokyo]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Megan Washington|Washington]], and [[Triple J Unearthed]] group [[Gypsy & The Cat]]. Australian acts that were placed high on the countdown were [[Angus & Julia Stone]], [[Little Red (band)|Little Red]]-Unearthed-[[Art vs. Science]]-Unearthed-[[Sia Furler|Sia]], and [[The Jezabels]]-Unearthed. The correlation between the Triple J Hottest 100, the [[ARIA Singles Chart|ARIA]] singles chart, and [[iTunes]] singles chart had been distinctly evident. The number one song of 2010, \"[[Big Jet Plane]],\" reached number 6 on the iTunes singles chart and number 32 on the ARIA singles chart, the week following the announcement of the Hottest 100 on 26 January. In 2014, [[Iggy Azalea]] started to make hits on music charts worldwide, sparking a trend for female rappers.

The chart success of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] song ''[[Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)]]'', which featured South African band [[Freshlyground]]-resulted in one of the country's first major chart topping hits by their own artist, launching a great amount of inspiration to other local instrumentalists.

Such acts like Wizkid and Davido had gained major success. Wizkid had won artist of the year at the MTV Africa Music Awards in 2016 and was involved with the writing production of Drake's \"One Dance.\" By June 2016, he had received a total of 34 awards from 106 nominations.

Ghana had many contemporary styles of music due to the geographical scale in Africa but these evolved into a much more contemporary style.

In the decade movements like [[Trap music (hip hop)|Trap music]], [[Cloud rap]], [[Drill music]], and [[Emo hip hop]] became mainstream. The 2010s are also notable for the increasing prominence of rap producers; examples being [[Young Chop]], [[Sonny Digital]], [[DJ Mustard]], [[Metro Boomin]] and [[DJ Khaled]].\n\n[[Progressive Rock|Progressive]] and [[Experimental Rock|experimental rock]] have started to become widespread, mainly in the second half of the decade. Artists, such as [[Nothing More]], [[Highly Suspect]], [[Twelve Foot Ninja]], [[Dead Letter Circus]], and [[Marmozets]], and DIY ethic bands, including Bad Omens, Sylar, \u00c6ges, and Silver Snakes, have enjoyed success through concerts and streaming services.\n\n[[Electronic dance music|EDM]] had become more mainstream due to the releases of [[Britney Spears]]' ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' and [[Kanye West]]'s \"[[Stronger (Kanye West song)|Stronger]]\"; some 2010s successes include [[David Guetta]], [[Skrillex]], [[Steve Aoki]], [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Headhunterz]], [[Wildstylez]], Da Tweekaz, [[Clean Bandit]], [[Major Lazer]], [[DVBBS]], [[Avicii]], [[Alesso]], [[Owl City]], [[The Chainsmokers]], [[Calvin Harris]], [[DJ Snake]], [[Diplo]], [[ShockOne]], [[Drumsound & Bassline Smith]], [[Blasterjaxx]], [[Martin Garrix]], [[Marshmello]], [[Alan Walker (music producer)|Alan Walker]] and [[Zedd]].\n\nThe genres of [[Europop]] and [[Eurodance]] have also achieved notable commercial success, evidenced by Swedish producer Max Martin's ubiquity in the decade's most successful pop albums. [[Katy Perry]]'s ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' (2010) drew heavily from this style and became the first album by a female artist in history to release five number one U.S. singles. Europop and electronica were used more extensively in the early 2010s as a result of the success of disk jockeys, like [[David Guetta]] and [[Calvin Harris]], also influencing the work of female solo acts like [[Rihanna]], [[Lady Gaga]], and [[Kesha]]. Some of the best-selling songs of the decade, including \"[[Only Girl (In the World)]]\" and \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\" by [[Rihanna]], were strongly influenced by Eurodance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 2012, a large number of songs by American instrumentalists featured quintessential Eurodance elements, especially synthesizer and strong beats during the [[Refrain|chorus]] mixed with rapping or vocals for verses. [[Flo Rida]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[LMFAO]], and [[The Black Eyed Peas]] were popular hip house acts from the early half of the 2010s.\n\n[[Teen pop]] had made a significant comeback throughout the decade, with the likes of [[Demi Lovato]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Ariana Grande]] Like their predecessors, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake, who rose to fame in the late 90s and early 2000s, most of these stars were exclusively associated or with [[Disney Channel]] and [[Nickelodeon]] at the genesis of careers.  An exception is Canadian artist Justin Bieber who rose fame through [[YouTube]] and social media. Throughout the 2010s, they have expanded control over their careers and come of age with their music to varying degrees of success, and many teen pop musicians outside the former companies have continued to launch promising careers throughout the 2010s.\n\nSince 2011, boy bands and girl groups have returned to mainstream popularity for the first time after the early 2000s, with the most popular examples being British-Irish boy band [[One Direction]] and American boy band [[Big Time Rush (band)|Big Time Rush]]. A new generation of successful girl groups was ushered in by acts such as [[Little Mix]] and [[Fifth Harmony]]. In addition to this, [[K-Pop]] groups, benefitting from high visibility on Social Media and Video sharing sites like [[YouTube]], began to capitalise on their viral power and monetise netizen fanbases overseas conducting sell out tours in western markets during the mid-2010s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7654354/kpop-concerts-live-hyuna-got7|title=K-Pop Concerts In 2017: GOT7, B1A4, HyunA & More Are Coming to America|website=Billboard|access-date=25 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601062126/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7654354/kpop-concerts-live-hyuna-got7|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Korean acts such as BIGBANG, EXO, and BTS sold out US tours with little to no promotion or support from mainstream media sources like TV & Radio Airplay.\n\nSoundtracks from films have topped the charts this decade as well, with number 1 singles from [[Lady Gaga]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Wiz Khalifa]], [[Charlie Puth]], [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[Pharrell Williams]], along with top 10 entries by [[The Weeknd]], [[Ellie Goulding]], and others.\n\n[[Dubstep]] and [[drumstep]] became widespread subgenres in the early 2010s on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, especially in its native [[United Kingdom]].

Mainstream rock since the early 2010s had become softer and more refined because of indie rock. Rock was reportedly still the most widely consumed genre in the United States during 2014 and 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/rock-music-twice-popular-pop-america-rb-rules-streaming/|title=Rock music is twice as popular as pop in America - but R&B rules streaming|date=11 January 2015|website=Music Business Worldwide|access-date=25 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301005018/https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/rock-music-twice-popular-pop-america-rb-rules-streaming/|archive-date=1 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The decade had also seen the return of successful rock artists from the past, including [[AC/DC]], [[David Bowie]], [[Metallica]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Blink 182|Blink-182]], [[Radiohead]], [[Green Day]], and [[Alice in Chains]]. All of these acts had albums debut within the top 5. In particular, English rock instrumentalist [[David Bowie]] experienced his most commercially successful period since the 1980s with two U.S. top 5 albums, ''[[The Next Day]]'' (2013) and ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]'' (2016), the latter being released shortly before his death.\n[[File:Imagine Dragons - Ilosaarirock 2013 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Imagine Dragons]] were an instant success after the release of their  debut album, ''[[Night Visions]]''.]]\n[[File:Vampire Weekend Red Rocks 05.20.13.jpg|thumb|[[Vampire Weekend]] followed up their debut album with two number 1 albums in 2010 and 2013.]]\n\n==== Alternative rock ====\n\nAlthough its subgenre, [[indie rock]], was in the spotlight during the 2010s, successful alternative rock bands in this decade were [[Imagine Dragons]], [[Linkin Park]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Coldplay]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Weezer]], [[Kasabian]], [[Thirty Seconds To Mars]], [[Kongos (band)|Kongos]], [[Cage The Elephant]], [[Evanescence]], [[Metric (band)|Metric]], [[Nickelback]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Three Days Grace]], [[The War on Drugs (band)|The War On Drugs]], [[Green Day]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Queens Of The Stone Age]], [[Panic! at the Disco]], [[Kaleo (band)|Kaleo]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Blink-182]], [[Twenty One Pilots]], [[Radiohead]], [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], [[Death from Above (band)|Death from Above 1979]], [[Paramore]], [[Biffy Clyro]], and [[Nothing But Thieves]]. All of these bands had had albums debut in the top 5. With [[Fall Out Boy]] scoring 3 number 1 albums in a row on the [[Billboard 200]] album chart in 2013, 2015, and 2018.\n\n==== Psychedelic rock ====\nThe decade had seen the revival of [[psychedelic rock]] as a popular subgenre for the first time since the 1970s. Bands of the decade had introduced synths and electronic sounds into the genre for the first time. Techniques seen in other genres such as [[Shoegaze]] were also employed to create walls of sound and distortion. Popular acts of the genre in the decade had been [[Animal Collective]], [[Tame Impala]], [[Unknown Mortal Orchestra]], [[Mac DeMarco]], [[The War on Drugs (band)|The War on Drugs]], [[Ariel Pink]], [[Connan Mockasin]], [[Homeshake]], [[King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard]], [[Thee Oh Sees]], [[Pond (Australian band)|Pond]], [[Temples (band)|Temples]], [[MGMT]], [[Allah-Las]], [[Ty Segall]], [[Samsara Blues Experiment]] and [[The Black Angels (band)|The Black Angels]].\n\n==== Progressive and experimental rock ====\nA huge renaissance in [[progressive rock]] occurred in the 2010s. One of the key forms of progressive music in the early 2010s was [[djent]]. It was influenced by mathematically driven metal from the previous decade, particularly [[Meshuggah]]. Guitarists such as [[Misha Mansoor]], Justin Lowe, and [[Tosin Abasi]] made use of [[seven-string guitar|seven-string]], [[eight-string guitar|eight-string]], and [[nine-string guitar]]s and mainly relied on [[polyrhythm]]s, [[palm-muting]], and [[syncopation|syncopated]] guitar riffs, as well as melodic guitar solos. Some of the most popular and influential djent bands were [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]], [[After the Burial]], [[Animals as Leaders]], [[Tesseract (band)|Tesseract]] and [[Born of Osiris]]. Djent's popularity led to more bands including more mathematical elements in their music with it eventually leading to elements in mainstream pop music.\n\nAnother form of progressive rock in this decade was [[post-progressive]], which drew influences from bands such as [[Radiohead]] and [[Porcupine Tree]] from the 2000s. This genre relies far more on simple melodic patterns combined with complex structure, texture and harmonies to create deep, emotionally driven, musical journeys in an effort to return the genre to its roots and make it relevant in the decade. Some newer progressive rock bands that were considered a part of this renaissance were [[Haken (band)|Haken]], [[Leprous]], [[Riverside (band)|Riverside]], [[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]], and [[iamthemorning]]. In addition, the 2010s also saw the return of some older artists including [[Opeth]], [[Devin Townsend]], [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]], and [[Steven Wilson]], who had a mainstream breakthrough with his studio albums ''[[Hand. Cannot. Erase.]]'' and ''[[To the Bone (Steven Wilson album)|To the Bone]]''. In 2019, [[Tool (band)|Tool]] experienced a major comeback with their first studio album in 13 years, ''[[Fear Inoculum]]''.\n\nIn the later part of the decade, this revival led to progressive rock crossing over with an indie-and-metal approach which became popular. Many of these bands are diverse in sound, and are influenced by genres like [[post-hardcore]], [[math rock]], and [[post-rock]] music. Artists making successful albums were part of this genre, like [[Nothing More]], [[Being as an Ocean]], [[Circa Survive]], [[Highly Suspect]], [[Dredg]], [[The Color Morale]], [[Twelve Foot Ninja]], [[The Mars Volta]], [[Hands Like Houses]], [[Code Orange (band)|Code Orange]], [[Sleepwave]], [[Dayshell]], [[Sworn in]], [[Dead Letter Circus]], [[Thank You Scientist]], [[Turbowolf]], [[Letlive]], [[Marmozets]], [[Black Map]], [[Biffy Clyro]], [[Night Verses]], [[Thrice]], [[The Word Alive]], [[Dance Gavin Dance]], [[Shining (Norwegian band)|Shining]], [[Mutoid Man]], [[Arcane Roots]] and [[A Perfect Circle]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==== Pop punk and punk rock ====\nWith a few exceptions (including [[Green Day]], [[The Offspring]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Paramore]], [[Blink-182]] and [[Panic! at the Disco]]), [[pop punk]] had heavily decreased in mainstream popularity during the 2010s and had not been enjoying popular success as it once did in the late 1990s and early 2000s. [[Emo]], which had gained heavy widespread success between 2004 and 2008, had heavily declined in popularity by the early 2010s with the 2013 Breakup of [[My Chemical Romance]] being a likely factor of that. Early 1990s punk rock bands, like [[Bad Religion]], [[NOFX]], and [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], had not had mainstream success since the 1990s or 2000s but still enjoyed heavy touring. Second wave pop punk acts, such as [[Good Charlotte]], [[Sum 41]], [[Simple Plan]], and [[New Found Glory]] had heavily declined in popularity. However, [[DIY ethic]] punk rock had seen somewhat of a cult resurgence with bands, including [[Martha (band)|Martha]], [[The Spook School (band)|The Spook School]], [[Neck Deep]], [[The Story So Far (band)|The Story So Far]], and [[Joanna Gruesome]], growing in popularity and being played on radio stations, like [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]. Garage punk bands such as [[Wavves]], [[FIDLAR]], [[PUP (band)|PUP]], [[Best Coast]], [[The Growlers]], [[Bass Drum of Death]], [[The Garden (band)|The Garden]], [[Ty Segall]], [[Cherry Glazerr]], and [[Thee Oh Sees]] had gained popularity, especially in Southern California. Many of these garage punk bands had signed to [[Burger Records]], who are known for their DIY style ethos and releasing albums on [[cassette tape]].\n\n==== Hard rock and heavy metal ====\n[[File:Peace and Love A Day to Remember 1.JPG|thumb|A Day to Remember was one of the most successful hard rock bands of the 2010s.]]\n\nDuring the 2010s, popular hard rock and heavy metal bands, such as [[Five Finger Death Punch]], [[Avenged Sevenfold]], [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], [[Asking Alexandria]], [[Breaking Benjamin]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Shinedown]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[A Day to Remember (band)|A Day to Remember]], [[Royal Blood (band)|Royal Blood]], [[Ghost (Swedish band)|Ghost]], [[Halestorm]], [[Volbeat]], [[Papa Roach]], [[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle]], [[Black Veil Brides]], [[Nothing More]], [[Parkway Drive]], [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]], and [[Seether]], had released successful albums. With many newer hard rock and heavy metal acts from this decade getting more success (especially with the streaming service success of progressive and experimental rock and metal music), the decade had also seen the return of older hard rock and heavy metal acts; some of which include bands that were previously on hiatus, or had not achieved mainstream popularity in years, like [[Soundgarden]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Deftones]], [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Slayer]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Faith No More]], [[Dream Theater]] and [[Metal Church]]. [[Guns N' Roses]] also experienced a major comeback during the mid-to-late 2010s with the [[Not in This Lifetime... Tour]], which saw a reunion of three-fifths of their classic lineup ([[Axl Rose]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Duff McKagan]]), all of whom last performed live together in 1993, and went on to become one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade.\n\n[[Thrash metal]] was not as popular in the 2010s as it was during the 1980s and early-to-mid-1990s, when the genre declined in popularity, due to the rising success of [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock|alternative]] music. However, the decade had seen several veteran thrash metal bands continue to maintain considerable popularity in the United States, particularly on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Each of \"[[The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria|the big four]]\" of the genre ([[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]) released albums that debuted on the top five or top ten on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref>{{cite web |title=Metallica's 'Hardwired...

Slow jams had largely been replaced by dance numbers and pop ballads. Contemporary R&B had begun to influence hipster musicians, creating a new genre called alternative R&B. New players had emerged from this subgenre, like [[The Weeknd]], [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], [[Dev Hynes|Blood Orange]], [[SZA (singer)|SZA]], [[The Internet (band)|The Internet]], [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Kali Uchis]], [[Syd (singer)|Syd]], [[How to Dress Well]], [[Kilo Kish]], [[Sampha]], [[Lion Babe]], [[Jhene Aiko]], [[Normani]], [[Frank Ocean]], [[Ravyn Lenae]], [[Kehlani]], [[Tinashe]], [[Sabrina Claudio]], [[H.E.R.]], [[Tory Lanez]], [[Gallant (singer)|Gallant]], [[Daniel Caesar]], [[King (R&B group)|King]], [[Moses Sumney]], [[Kelela]], [[dvsn]], [[Jorja Smith]], [[PartyNextDoor]], [[Jeremih]], [[Khalid (singer)|Khalid]], [[Bryson Tiller]], and [[Ella Mai]].\n\nA few top mainstream contemporary R&B artists of the 2010s were [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Chris Brown]], [[Usher (singer)|Usher]], [[Rihanna]], [[Bruno Mars]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[The Weeknd]], [[Trey Songz]], [[Miguel (singer)|Miguel]], [[Bryson Tiller]], [[Alicia Keys]], and [[John Legend]]. There was also a slight revival of soul during the early 2010s, with instrumentalists, such as [[Cee Lo Green]], [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]], and [[Adele]].\n\nDue to the domination of electro and dance-pop, contemporary R&B had partially become more influenced by dance and electropop, and many musicians that were typically contemporary R&B artists had started to release pop. This is notable in players, including Ne-Yo, Usher, Chris Brown, and Rihanna with songs, like \"Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)\" and \"Forever Now,\" \"Scream\" and \"OMG,\" \"Don't Wake Me Up\" and \"Turn Up The Music,\" and \"We Found Love\" and \"Where Have You Been.\" A form of R&B, [[dancehall]], also became popular on the charts in the mid to late 2010s with songs such as \"[[Lean On]]\" by [[Major Lazer]], \"[[One Dance]]\" by [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], and [[Work (Rihanna song)|Work]] by [[Rihanna]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7616664/dancehall-charts-producers|title=Meet the Producers Who Brought Dancehall Back to the Charts In 2016|website=Billboard|access-date=13 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422191448/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7616664/dancehall-charts-producers|archive-date=22 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a resurgence of contemporary R&B acts from the 1990s and 2000s to achieve commercial success during the 2010s, such as [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], [[Kelly Rowland]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Maxwell (singer)|Maxwell]], [[D'Angelo]], and [[Janet Jackson]].\n\nWhile some contemporary R&B artists transitioned to a more dance and electropop sound, many artists still achieved success while still remaining true to contemporary R&B. Songs, including \"Everything to Me\" by Monica, \"Refill\" by Elle Varner, \"Thinking Bout You\" by Frank Ocean, \"Motivation\" by Kelly Rowland, \"Put It Down\" by Brandy, and \"No Sleeep\" by Janet Jackson, are notable for being contemporary R&B and popular hits while still obtaining an authentic contemporary R&B sound.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 became the first artist in Billboard chart history to have her first six albums debut at number-one on the Billboard 200 chart in 2016. Additionally, Beyonc\u00e9 also became the first artist to place 12 tracks from one album within the Hot 100 simultaneously. Continuing her success from the 90s and 2000s, Beyonc\u00e9 received the Billboard Millennium Award at the [[2011 Billboard Music Awards]], the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award]] at the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards]], the Fashion Icon Award from the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]] in 2016, and a [[Peabody Award]] for her universally acclaimed sixth studio album ''[[Lemonade (Beyonc\u00e9 album)|Lemonade]]'' in 2017. In 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 surpassed Madonna as the most-awarded artist at the MTV Video Music Awards (24 wins). In 2018, her [[Beyonc\u00e9 2018 Coachella performance|performance]] made history as the most watched live-streamed performance of all time, and was also called \"historic\" and dubbed the single best performance of all time by many newspapers.\n\nThe late 2010s had seen a resurgence of mainstream popularity in R&B, with albums such as ''[[24K Magic (album)|24K Magic]]'' by Bruno Mars, ''[[Heartbreak on a Full Moon]]'' by Chris Brown and songs such as \"[[Redbone (song)|Redbone]]\" by [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]] and \"Boo\u2019d Up\" by [[Ella Mai]].\n\n=== Hip hop ===\nOn 17 July 2017, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]/[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] (which [[Nielsen SoundScan]] classifies as the same genre) had recently usurped [[Rock music|rock]] as the most consumed [[musical genre]], becoming the most popular genre in music for the first time in U.S. history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2017/07/hip-hop-popular-genre-nielsen-music|title=Hip-Hop Becomes Most Popular Genre In Music For First Time In U.S. History|date=18 July 2017|website=Vibe|access-date=26 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027061543/https://www.vibe.com/2017/07/hip-hop-popular-genre-nielsen-music/|archive-date=27 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2017/07/17/hip-hoprb-has-now-become-the-dominant-genre-in-the-u-s-for-the-first-time/|title=Report: Hip-Hop/R&B Is The Dominant Genre In The U.S. For The First Time|first=Hugh|last=McIntyre|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027021720/https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2017/07/17/hip-hoprb-has-now-become-the-dominant-genre-in-the-u-s-for-the-first-time/|archive-date=27 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/07/nielsen-hip-hop-rb-most-consumed-genres-u-s/|title=Nielsen Says Hip-Hop/R&B Is Now Most Consumed Genre in U.S. \u2013 XXL|website=XXL Mag|access-date=26 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027021640/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/07/nielsen-hip-hop-rb-most-consumed-genres-u-s/|archive-date=27 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://hypebeast.com/2017/7/hip-hop-rock-most-consumed-music-genre-united-states|title=Hip-Hop Takes the Throne, Passes Rock as Most Consumed Genre in U.S.|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027061512/https://hypebeast.com/2017/7/hip-hop-rock-most-consumed-music-genre-united-states|archive-date=27 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA number of hip hop labels had also grown influential during this decade, among which had been [[Grand Hustle Records]], [[GOOD Music]], [[Cash Money Records]], [[Roc Nation]], [[Maybach Music Group]], [[Top Dawg Entertainment]], and [[Def Jam Recordings]].

Most successful \"SoundCloud rappers\" might not release all their music on the platform opting instead for streaming services [[Apple Music]] and [[Spotify]] but are still categorized as \"SoundCloud rappers\" or \"Internet\"/\"Underground rappers\" due to their aesthetics, sonics, come up on the platform and collaborations with other rappers and producers in the scene. It is characterized as simplistic, bass heavy beats, often with hazy, lo-fi or shimmering sounding melodies or samples, paired with lyrics that ping-pong between braggadocio and nihilism, with lots of sex and odes to heavy narcotics. The subgenre began to start seeing mainstream popularity in the mid 2010s and takes sonic and aesthetic inspiration from the [[Trap music (EDM)|trap]], [[Drill music|drill]], [[Cloud Rap]], and internet rap scenes that began in the late 2000s and early 2010s on websites such as [[DatPiff]] and rap blogs with artists such as [[Gucci Mane]], [[Lil B]], [[Odd Future]], [[Young Thug]], [[Max B]], [[Lil Ugly Mane]], [[A$AP Mob]], [[SpaceGhostPurrp]] and [[Chief Keef]]. The subgenre was met with some criticism for having less emphasis on lyricism, and the problematic nature of the artists to arise from it, such as Lil Peep's drug abuse that led to his death, the multiple assault charges to XXXTentacion, and the murder charges on Tay-K.  Influential SoundCloud rappers include [[Kodak Black]], [[Yung Bans]], [[Lil Peep]], [[Lil Pump]], [[Lil Uzi Vert]], [[Travis Scott]], Uno The Activist, [[Lil Yachty]], [[Smokepurpp]], [[Tay-K]], [[Ski Mask the Slump God]], ThouxanBanFauni, [[XXXTentacion]], [[21 Savage]], [[6ix9ine]], [[Trippie Redd]], [[Denzel Curry]], [[Lucki]], Warhol.ss, [[Maxo Kream]], Young Nudy, [[Ugly God]], [[Playboi Carti]], Rico Nasty, [[Lil Tracy]], and [[Juice WRLD]].\n\n==== Trap ====\n[[Trap music]] is a style of [[Southern hip hop]] and [[gangsta rap]] that was developed in the late 1990s to early 2000s in the [[Southern United States]].<ref name=\"gq\">{{cite web|last=Phili|first=Stelios|title=Fighting Weight: From the Trap to the Treadmill|url=https://www.gq.com/how-to/rest-of-your-life/201210/dj-scream-trap-music-playlist#slide=1|work=[[GQ]]|accessdate=30 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160816120338/https://www.gq.com/how-to/rest-of-your-life/201210/dj-scream-trap-music-playlist#slide=1|archivedate=16 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=dj-mag>{{cite web|title=The trap phenomenon explained|url=http://djmag.com/content/trap-music-under-lock-key|publisher=[[DJ Magazine|DJ Mag]]|accessdate=30 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723021444/http://djmag.com/content/trap-music-under-lock-key|archivedate=23 July 2013}}</ref> It is typified by [[double-time|double]] or triple-time sub-divided [[hi-hat]]s,<ref name=\"jgenrechar\">{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/2012/6/11/quit-screwing-with-trap-music-an-interview-with-houston-born-producer-l%C5%8Dtic--2|title=Quit Screwing with Trap Music: An Interview with Houston-Born Producer L\u014dtic|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=11 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103061941/http://motherboard.vice.com/2012/6/11/quit-screwing-with-trap-music-an-interview-with-houston-born-producer-l%C5%8Dtic--2|archivedate=3 November 2012}}</ref> heavy, sub-bass layered [[kick drum]]s from the [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine, layered [[synthesizer]]s and an overall dark, ominous or bleak atmosphere and lyrical content.<ref name=\"cr\">{{cite web|last=Raymer|first=Miles|title=Who owns trap?|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/trap-rap-edm-flosstradamus-uz-jeffrees-lex-luger/Content?oid=7975249|publisher=[[Chicago Reader]]|accessdate=30 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527094836/http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/trap-rap-edm-flosstradamus-uz-jeffrees-lex-luger/Content?oid=7975249|archivedate=27 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"topman\">{{cite web|title=Trap Music: The Definitive Guide|url=http://magazine.topman.com/category/ctrl-music/trap-music-the-definitive-guide/|accessdate=14 February 2013|author=Joseph Patterson|publisher=Topman.

In the 2010s, artists crossbred trap with [[dubstep]] to create [[trap music (EDM)|trap EDM]].

Trap music during the 2010s also helped record producers rise to prominence such as [[Mike Will Made It]], [[Lex Luger (record producer)|Lex Luger]], [[Southside (record producer)|Southside]], [[Metro Boomin]], [[London on da Track]], and more.\n\n=== Electronic ===\n[[File:Skrillex Ottawa Bluesfest.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Grammy Award]]-winning [[Skrillex]], in 2011]]\n\nWhile dance music had periodically conquered the American pop charts, its current incursion had most likely been its deepest since the disco heyday of the 1970s. Throughout the 2010s, various [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]] subgenres had conquered the music scene, such as [[house music|house]], [[dubstep]], [[drumstep]], [[hardstyle]], [[Electro House|electro house]], [[techno]], [[trance music|trance]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]], and [[Trap music (EDM)|trap]]. These genres have many musical influences from 1970s' [[disco]], 1980s' [[hi-NRG]], [[spacesynth]], [[Italo disco]], and [[new wave music|new wave]], and 1990s' and 2000s' [[Eurodance]], [[techno]], [[House music|house]], [[trip hop]], [[Europop]], [[garage rock]], and [[trance music|trance]]. The rise of electronic dance had brought massive success to large festivals, raves, technoparades, algoraves, doofs, and teknivals that mostly take place in the United States and Europe though every year thousands of electronic focused music festivals are held throughout the world. These events are also well known for their long association with the use of recreational drugs, including [[MDMA]], [[LSD]], [[2C-B]], [[Ketamine]], and [[Benzylpiperazine]]. The top mainstream [[Disc jockey|disk jockeys]] in the 2010s were [[Tiesto]], [[David Guetta]], [[Calvin Harris]], [[Steve Aoki]], [[Nicky Romero]], [[Afrojack]], [[Deadmau5]], [[Diplo]], [[Skrillex]], [[Armin Van Buuren]], [[Avicii]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]], [[Martin Garrix]], [[Hardwell]], [[The Chainsmokers]], [[Marshmello]], [[Major Lazer]], [[DJ Snake]], [[Slushii]], and [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]].\n\n=== Country ===\n[[File:Taylor Swift Red Tour 2, 2013.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Taylor Swift]] is one of the most successful country artists of the 2010s.

The most popular country acts during this decade were [[Zac Brown Band]], [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Jason Aldean]], [[The Band Perry]], [[Keith Urban]], [[Luke Bryan]], [[Blake Shelton]], [[Lady Antebellum]], [[Tim Mcgraw|Tim McGraw]], [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], [[Brantley Gilbert]], [[Eric Church]], [[Dierks Bentley]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Thomas Rhett]], [[Cole Swindell]], [[Rascal Flatts]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Jake Owen]], [[Dustin Lynch]], [[Kip Moore]], [[Little Big Town]], [[Chris Young (musician)|Chris Young]], [[Hunter Hayes]], [[Cam]], [[Sam Hunt (musician)|Sam Hunt]], [[Lee Brice]], [[Eli Young Band]], [[Darius Rucker]], [[Randy Houser]], [[Kelsea Ballerini]], [[Maren Morris]], [[Billy Currington]], [[Tyler Farr]], [[Brett Eldredge]], [[Sturgill Simpson]], [[Chris Stapleton]], [[Luke Combs]], [[Kane Brown]], and [[Brett Young (singer)|Brett Young]].\n\nA large number of duos and vocal groups had begun to emerge on the charts during the 2010s, many of which feature close harmony in the lead vocals, a style that roots as far back as the 1940s and 1950s with acts, like The Shelton Brothers, Delmore Brothers, and [[Everly Brothers]]. It saw a resurgence in the 1980s with [[The Judds]] and [[The Bellamy Brothers]] although the more recent acts tend to not be related. Examples of successful duos were [[Florida Georgia Line]], [[Love and Theft (duo)|Love and Theft]], [[Dan + Shay]], The Howboy Catts, and [[Thompson Square]]. In addition to Lady Antebellum, bands, such as The Band Perry, Gloriana, Eli Young Band, and Zac Brown Band had come to occupy a large portion of the new, popular country players. Meanwhile, artists who began their careers as far back as the 1960s and 1970s had continued to be active, including [[Willie Nelson]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]], [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], [[George Strait]], and [[Reba McEntire]].\n\nIn September 2016, \"[[Forever Country]],\" a medley of three classic country songs \u2013 \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]],\" \"[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]\" and \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\"\u2014was recorded to honor the [[50th Annual Country Music Association Awards]]. A celebration of traditional country music and the genre's ongoing popularity, the song blended together 30 stars, ranging from newcomers to veteran to classic stars and acts of the genre. A similar medley, featuring many of the same stars that performed on \"Forever Country\" but with different songs, was performed at the CMA Awards. Both performances received widespread critical acclaim.\n\n==== Hip hop's influence on country ====\nSeveral popular country songs have taken influence from 21st-century hip hop, rock, and pop and have had themes of partying, attractive young women, blue jeans, Southern rock, and pickup trucks. These characteristics are typical in an unofficial subgenre known as [[bro-country]]. Instrumentalists embracing this trend were Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, Eric Church, Florida Georgia Line, Brantley Gilbert, and several others, with songs, like \"[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]],\" \"[[That's My Kind of Night]],\" and Blake Shelton's \"[[Boys 'Round Here]]\" having been the most widespread songs in terms of sales and downloads. While many of the themes of bro-country songs -\u2013 in particular, women and alcohol \u2013- have always been a part of country, the new genre came under fire by listeners, music reviewers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/soundposts/2014/03/04/women-edged-out-by-bro-country-party-song-trend/ |title=Women edged out by \u2018bro-country\u2019 party song trend? |date=4 March 2014 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=24 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105202/http://blogs.seattletimes.com/soundposts/2014/03/04/women-edged-out-by-bro-country-party-song-trend/ |archive-date=31 May 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> and classic country musicians, such as [[Alan Jackson]] and [[Gary Allan]],<ref name=\"smith\">{{cite web |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2013/10/01/country-music-identity-crisis/ |title=How country music went crazy: A comprehensive timeline of the genre's identity crisis |last=Smith |first=Grady |date=1 October 2013 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=24 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214201459/http://music-mix.ew.com/2013/10/01/country-music-identity-crisis/ |archive-date=14 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> and was satirized in the song \"[[Girl in a Country Song]]\" by the duo [[Maddie & Tae]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/maddie-tae-fire-a-shot-at-bro-country-20140715 |title=Maddie & Tae Fire a Shot at 'Bro Country' |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=23 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923145811/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/maddie-tae-fire-a-shot-at-bro-country-20140715 |archive-date=23 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The shifting styles also played a role in a brief feud between Shelton and country legend [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] in 2013, just months before Price's death, after Shelton remarked that \"Nobody wants to listen to their grandpa\u2019s music\" and that younger consumers weren't buying or downloading classic country music because the styles and sounds of songs from the past didn't appeal to them. Price \u2013- who, unlike several of his peers, usually kept quiet in the debate on classic country vs. more modern music \u2013- expressed his disapproval via his Facebook page, stating that it was their styles and success that helped make newer stars' careers possible and paved the way to modern country music. Shelton later retracted his statement, and Price accepted his apology.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nIn March 2019, the song \"[[Old Town Road]],\" a song performed by American rap artist [[Lil Nas X]] (born Montero Hill), began gaining popularity with country music fans, particularly after a remix of the song featuring vocals by [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] was released earlier in the year. The song combined elements of [[country rap]], [[hip hop]], [[Southern hip hop]] and [[trap music|trap]], and used themes of horseback riding and culture clash with urban America in its lyrics. The song became the first to chart on all three of the major ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts \u2013 [[Hot 100]], [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] and Hot Country Songs \u2013 in nearly 60 years, charting at No. 19 on the country chart. However, one week after its debut on the country chart, ''Billboard'' removed the song from the chart, disqualifying the song on the grounds that it did not fit the [[Country music|country]] genre.<ref name=\"RS\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-810844/|title=Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road' Was a Country Hit.

[[Mindy McCready]], a rising star of the late 1990s whose personal problems soon overshadowed her music, committed suicide during early 2013. [[Glen Campbell]], a vastly influential country guitarist and vocalist from the 1960s onward, was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] in late 2010 and consequently retired from show business in 2013; he died in 2017. [[Randy Travis]], a neo-traditionalist star who helped revive the genre in the mid-to-late 1980s, had several run-ins with the law in 2012 and in 2013 suffered a massive stroke. Troy Gentry of [[Montgomery Gentry]], one of the genre's most popular duos, was killed in a helicopter crash in 2017. Also in 2017, 58 concertgoers at the [[Route 91 Harvest]] festival event in Las Vegas, Nevada \u2013 where Jason Aldean was performing at the time gunfire broke out \u2013 were killed in [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|a mass shooting]]; Aldean escaped the incident uninjured and a week later paid tribute to the victims on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.\n\nProminent [[classic country]] players who had died during the decade, besides Glen Campbell, were [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]], [[Kitty Wells]], [[Patti Page]], [[Jack Greene]], [[Slim Whitman]], [[George Jones]], Ray Price, [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Lynn Anderson]], [[Jim Ed Brown]], [[Sonny James]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Jean Shepard]], [[Don Williams]], [[Mel Tillis]], [[Freddie Hart]], [[Roy Clark]], [[Dave & Sugar|Dave Rowland]] (lead singer of the 1970s trio Dave and Sugar), [[Earl Thomas Conley]] and all three of the [[Tompall & the Glaser Brothers|Glaser Brothers]] ([[Tompall Glaser|Tompall]] in 2013, and brothers [[Jim Glaser|Jim]] and Chuck in 2019). Besides Mindy McCready and Troy Gentry, several performers from the 1990s and later who were popular with audiences also died: [[Kevin Sharp]], [[Lari White]] and [[Daryle Singletary]]. Also, [[Glenn Frey]], a member of [[The Eagles|Eagles]], a rock band whose style has been vastly influential in country from the 1970s onward, died during the decade. Additionally, longtime radio personality [[Bob Kingsley]], who presented many of the above-mentioned classic artists' songs during his tenures hosting the radio programs ''[[American Country Countdown]]'' and ''[[Bob Kingsley's Country Top 40]]'', died in the fall of 2019, shortly after revealing his diagnosis of cancer.<ref>\"Bob Kingsley Dies At Age 80,\" All Access Music Group, October 17, 2019.

Bands like [[Two Door Cinema Club]], [[Foals (band)|Foals]], and [[Bombay Bicycle Club]], which emerged in the late 2000s, had succeeded in the album chart. The genre had had a stronger presence album-wise, with acts such as [[The 1975]], [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]], [[alt-J]], and [[The Vaccines]] enjoying success. [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]] had scored two number 2 singles on the UK chart, with their sound bordering on mainstream pop music in the charts. [[Royal Blood (band)|Royal Blood]] was the first band formed during the decade to win a [[Brit award|Brit Award]] for the best British group in 2014, only one year after forming.

Australian radio station [[Triple J]] had played a large role in promoting new Australian music, especially through the [[Triple J Hottest 100]], a worldwide public poll on each individual's favourite music from each given year. During 2010, Australian pop instrumentalists to feature substantially in the countdown were [[Birds of Tokyo]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Megan Washington|Washington]], and [[Triple J Unearthed]] group [[Gypsy & The Cat]]. Australian acts that were placed high on the countdown were [[Angus & Julia Stone]], [[Little Red (band)|Little Red]]-Unearthed-[[Art vs. Science]]-Unearthed-[[Sia Furler|Sia]], and [[The Jezabels]]-Unearthed. The correlation between the Triple J Hottest 100, the [[ARIA Singles Chart|ARIA]] singles chart, and [[iTunes]] singles chart had been distinctly evident. The number one song of 2010, \"[[Big Jet Plane]],\" reached number 6 on the iTunes singles chart and number 32 on the ARIA singles chart, the week following the announcement of the Hottest 100 on 26 January. In 2014, [[Iggy Azalea]] started to make hits on music charts worldwide, sparking a trend for female rappers.

Outside Asia, social media and video sharing sites such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], [[Tumblr]], [[Reddit]] and [[Twitter]] had a significant influence in promulgating awareness of Korean pop to new western audiences. Shareable, high-production value music videos, eye-catching fashion and slick choreographies paired with music influenced by western pop trends helped establish K-pop as an intriguing online spectacle. The genre proved it could convert viral success into commercial success in 2012, when [[Psy]]'s \"[[Gangnam Style]]\" became a breakout viral hit topping the music charts of more than 30 countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, and the United Kingdom as well as No.2 in the United States.\n\nGlobalisation had afforded K-pop groups continued expansion into the Western markets, most notably the United States, through tours, online downloads and streaming services like [[Spotify]] and [[Apple Music]], who added more K-pop to their libraries in response to increased demand from K-fans. Korean Female group [[2NE1]] and male groups [[Exo (band)|Exo]] and [[BTS (band)|BTS]] all charted on the Billboard 200 albums chart with Korean language albums in the 2010s. These albums, although recorded in Korean, incorporated English-language phrases and slang terms into their lyrics and used popular western music trends of the time such as Hip-Hop, R&B, EDM, Tropical House, Deep House and Trap Music to their benefit.  Similar to the bubblegum pop groups of the 1990s, K-pop occupies a predominantly youth demographic despite the language barrier.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/arts/music/shinee-and-south-korean-k-pop-groups-at-madison-square-garden-review.html |work=The New York Times |first=Jon |last=Caramanica |title=SHINee and South Korean K-Pop Groups at Madison Square Garden \u2013 Review |date=24 October 2011 |access-date=26 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217224440/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/arts/music/shinee-and-south-korean-k-pop-groups-at-madison-square-garden-review.html?_r=0 |archive-date=17 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Leading K-pop acts were [[Girls' Generation]], [[2NE1]], [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]], [[Super Junior]], [[Psy]], [[Exo (band)|Exo]], [[BTS (band)|BTS]], [[2PM]], [[Mamamoo]], [[GFriend]], [[Blackpink]], [[Twice (group)|Twice]] and [[Red Velvet (group)|Red Velvet]].
