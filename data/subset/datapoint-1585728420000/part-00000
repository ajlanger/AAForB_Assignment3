It was among the first birds to be scientifically described in [[Australia]], and was initially named ''Certhia novaehollandiae''.\n\n==Description==\nThe bird is around 18 centimeters long and is mainly black, with a white iris, white facial tufts and yellow margins on its wing and tail feathers. It is a very active bird and rarely sits long enough to give an extended view. When danger approaches a New Holland honeyeater, such as a [[bird of prey]], a group of honeyeaters will form together and give a warning call. Sexes are similar in looks with the exception that females are, on average, slightly smaller. Young honeyeaters (<1 year old) have similar colouring but have grey eyes and a yellow [[gape]] and \"whiskers\" near the [[Beak#Nares|nares]]. They appear to be a socially [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous]] bird with no sign of co-operative breeding, but this observation is yet to be examined.\n\n==Breeding==\nThe breeding behaviour of the New Holland honeyeater has been relatively well documented. In southern and eastern Australia, breeding commonly occurs during autumn and spring, although certain coastal populations may breed at any time of the year given suitable conditions, including sufficient food and absence of adverse weather. In Western Australia, New Holland honeyeaters have been observed to breed once annually from July to November, when nectar is abundant<ref name=McFarland>McFarland, D. C.

Emu 86, 161\u2013167.</ref>.\n\nIn breeding territories, males spend a large proportion of their time defending the nest and food resources, while the females invest a large proportion of their time in reproductive labour including nest construction, incubation, and a majority of the nestling care <ref name=McFarland></ref><ref name=Clarke>Clarke, R.

Emu 106, 113\u2013118.</ref>.\n\n==Diet==\nNew Holland honeyeaters obtain most of their carbohydrate requirements from the [[nectar]] of flowers. Consequently, they are key pollinators of many flowering plant species, many of which are endemic to Australia, such as ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Hakea]]'', ''[[Xanthorrhoea]]'', and ''[[Acacia]]''. New Holland honeyeaters may also consume honeydew, a sugary secretion produced by members of the family [[Psyllidae]]. Despite feeding primarily on nectar, New Holland honeyeaters are not strictly nectarivorous. Nectar does not contain protein, so New Holland honeyeaters must supplement their diet with invertebrates, such as spiders and insects that are rich in protein. They sometimes feed alone but usually gather in groups.\n\n==Subspecies==\nThere are currently five described subspecies of ''Phylidonyris novaehollandiae'':\n*'' P. novaehollandiae novaehollandiae'' (South-eastern mainland Australia; Latham, 1790)\n*'' P. novaehollandiae canescens'' (Tasmania; Latham, 1790),\n*'' P. novaehollandiae campbelli'' (Kangaroo Island, South Australia; Matthews, 1923)\n*'' P. novaehollandiae longirostris'' (Western Australia; Gould, 1846)\n*'' P. novaehollandiae caudatus'' (Bass Strait islands; Salomonsen, 1966).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Newhollandhoneyeater.jpg|New Holland honeyeater, 2005\nImage:New Holland.jpg|New Holland honeyeater, Lindisfarne, Tasmania\nImage:New_holland_honeyeater_nest.jpg|New Holland honeyeater nest, eggs and chicks, Western Australia\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Phylidonyris novaehollandiae|New Holland honeyeater (''Phylidonyris novaehollandiae'')}}\n{{Wikispecies|Phylidonyris novaehollandiae}}\n\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.freesound.org/people/digifishmusic/sounds/42794 Call of New Holland honeyeaters]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q380225}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:honeyeater, New Holland}}\n[[Category:Phylidonyris|New Holland honeyeater]]\n[[Category:Pollinator birds]]\n[[Category:Birds of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Birds of South Australia]]\n[[Category:Birds of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Birds of Victoria (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Birds of Tasmania]]\n[[Category:Endemic birds of Australia]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1790|New Holland honeyeater]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| name = New Holland honeyeater\n| image = New Holland Honeyeater 1.jpg\n| image_caption = New Holland honeyeater at Victoria, Australia\n| status = LC\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22704361/0 |title=''Phylidonyris novaehollandiae'' |author=BirdLife International |author-link=BirdLife International |year=2012 |access-date=26 November 2013|ref=harv}}</ref>\n| taxon = Phylidonyris novaehollandiae\n| authority = ([[John Latham (ornithologist)|Latham]], 1790)\n}}\n\nThe '''New Holland honeyeater''' (''Phylidonyris novaehollandiae'') is a [[honeyeater]] species found throughout [[southern Australia]].
