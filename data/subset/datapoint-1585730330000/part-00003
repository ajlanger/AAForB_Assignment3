The architect viewed videos of [[Olympic cauldron]] on YouTube as part of the design process and concluded that the 2019 Southeast Asian Games cauldron \"must be Filipino\" and directed his firm to look into his original design for the unbuilt [[Centennial Tower (Philippines)|Centennial Tower]] which was inspired from the sulo, a traditional Filipino torch.
