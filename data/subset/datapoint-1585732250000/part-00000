Early international cricket was disrupted by the [[French Revolution]] and the [[American Civil War]]. The earliest international cricket match was between [[United States v Canada (1844)|USA and Canada]], on 24 and 25 September 1844.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/usa/engine/match/318995.html United States of America v Canada 1844] \u2013 [[ESPNcricinfo]].</ref> This has never been officially considered a \"Test match\". Tours of national English sides abroad took place, particularly to the US, Australia and New Zealand. The [[Australian Aborigines]] team became the first organised overseas cricketers to [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868|tour England]] in [[1868 English cricket season|1868]].\n\nTwo rival English tours of Australia were proposed in the early months of 1877, with [[James Lillywhite]] campaigning for a professional tour and [[Fred Grace]] for an amateur one. Grace's tour fell through and it was Lillywhite's team that toured New Zealand and Australia in 1876\u201377. Two matches against a combined Australian XI were later classified as the first official Test matches. The first match was won by Australia, by 45 runs and the second by England. After reciprocal tours established a pattern of international cricket, [[The Ashes]] was established as a competition during the Australian tour of England in 1882. Surprisingly beaten, a mock obituary of English cricket was published in the ''Sporting Times'' the following day: the phrase \"The body shall be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\" prompted the subsequent creation of the Ashes urn. The series of 1884\u201385 was the first to be held over five matches: Shaw, writing in 1901, considered the side to be \"the best ever to have left England\".\n\nSouth Africa became the third team to play Test cricket in 1888\u201389, when they hosted a tour by an under-strength England side.\n\n==Test status==\nTest matches are the highest level of cricket, played between national representative teams with \"Test status\", as determined by the [[International Cricket Council]]. {{As of|June 2017}}, twelve national teams have Test status, the most recently promoted being Afghanistan and Ireland on 22 June 2017.<ref name=AI_test>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/40364481 |title=Ireland & Afghanistan awarded Test status by International Cricket Council |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=22 June 2017 |website=BBC News |publisher= |access-date=22 June 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Teams with Test status===\nTest status is conferred upon a country or group of countries by the ICC. There are currently twelve men's teams that have been granted this status. International teams that do not have Test status can play [[first-class cricket]] in the [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]], under conditions which are similar to Tests.\n\nThe teams with Test status (with the date of each team's Test debut) are:\n#{{cr|Australia}} ([[English cricket team in Australia in 1876\u201377#First Test: England v Australia (15\u201319 March 1877)|15 March 1877]])\n#{{cr|England}} ([[English cricket team in Australia in 1876\u201377#First Test: England v Australia (15\u201319 March 1877)|15 March 1877]])\n#{{cr|South Africa}} ([[English cricket team in South Africa in 1888\u201389#First Test - South Africa v England (12\u201313 March 1889)|12 March 1889]])\n#{{cr|West Indies}} ([[West Indian cricket team in England in 1928#The First Test, Lord's, 23\u201326 June 1928|23 June 1928]])\n#{{cr|New Zealand}} ([[English cricket team in New Zealand in 1929\u201330#Test series summary|10 January 1930]])\n#{{cr|India}} ([[Indian cricket team in England in 1932#Only Test match|25 June 1932]])\n#{{cr|Pakistan}} ([[Pakistani cricket team in India in 1952\u201353#1st Test|16 October 1952]])\n#{{cr|Sri Lanka}} ([[English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 1981\u201382#Only Test|17 February 1982]]) \n#{{cr|Zimbabwe}} ([[Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 1992\u201393#Only Test|18 October 1992]])\n#{{cr|Bangladesh}} ([[2000\u201301 Bangladeshi cricket season#Indian cricket team in Bangladesh|10 November 2000]])\n#{{cr|Ireland}} ([[Pakistani cricket team in Ireland in 2018#Only Test|11 May 2018]])\n#{{cr|Afghanistan}} ([[Afghan cricket team in India in 2018\u201319#Only Test|14 June 2018]])\n\nMost of these teams represent independent sovereign nations. The exceptions are the England cricket team, which represents the [[countries of the UK|constituent countries]] of [[England]] and [[Wales]]; the West Indies, a combined team from fifteen Caribbean nations and territories; and Ireland, representing both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nZimbabwe's Test status was voluntarily suspended in 2006 because of poor performances.

Performances in first-class matches count towards only the first-class statistical record, but performances in Test matches count towards both the Test statistics and the first-class statistics.\n\nStatisticians have developed criteria to determine which matches count as Tests, if they were played before the formal definition of Test status. The first list of matches considered to be \"Tests\" was drawn up by Clarence Moody, an Australian, in the mid-1890s. Representative matches played by simultaneous England touring sides of 1891\u201392 ([[English cricket team in Australia in 1891\u201392|in Australia]] and [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1891\u201392|South Africa]]) and 1929\u201330 ([[English cricket team in the West Indies in 1929\u201330|in the West Indies]] and [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 1929\u201330|New Zealand]]) are deemed to have \"Test status\".\n\nIn 1970, a series of five \"Test matches\" was played in England between England and a Rest of the World XI. These matches, originally scheduled between England and South Africa, were amended after South Africa was suspended from international cricket because of their government's policy of [[apartheid]]. Although initially given Test status (and included as Test matches in some record books, including ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]''), this was later withdrawn and a principle was established that official Test matches can only be between nations (although the geographically and demographically small countries of the West Indies have since 1928 been permitted to field a coalition side). Despite this, in 2005, the ICC ruled that the six-day [[ICC Super Series 2005|Super Series]] match that took place in October 2005, between Australia and a World XI, was an official Test match. Some cricket writers and statisticians, including [[Bill Frindall]], ignored the ICC's ruling and excluded the 2005 match from their records. The series of \"Test matches\" played in Australia between Australia and a World XI in 1971\u201372 do not have Test status. The commercial \"[[World Series Cricket|Supertests]]\" organised by [[Kerry Packer]] as part of his [[World Series Cricket]] enterprise and played between \"WSC Australia\", \"WSC World XI\" and \"WSC West Indies\" from 1977 to 1979 have never been regarded as official Test matches.\n\n==Conduct of the game==\n\n===Playing time===\n{{See also|Playing time (cricket)}}\nA standard day of Test cricket consists of three sessions of two hours each, the breaks between sessions being 40 minutes for lunch and 20 minutes for tea. However, the times of sessions and intervals may be altered in certain circumstances: if bad weather or a change of innings occurs close to a scheduled break, the break may be taken immediately; if there has been a loss of playing time, for example because of bad weather, the session times may be adjusted to make up the lost time; if the batting side is nine [[dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] down at the scheduled tea break, then the interval may be delayed until either 30 minutes has elapsed or the team is ''all out'';<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-15-intervals,41,AR.html |title=The Laws of Cricket \u2013 Law 15.8 |publisher=Lords.org |accessdate=18 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124062128/http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-15-intervals,41,AR.html |archivedate=24 November 2012  }}</ref> the final session may be extended by up to 30 minutes if 90 or more [[over (cricket)|overs]] have not been [[bowling (cricket)|bowled]] in that day's play (subject to any reduction for adverse weather);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://l.yimg.com/t/icccricket/pdfs/test_playing_conditions.pdf |title=ICC Standard Test Match Playing Conditions (\"Playing Conditions\") cl 16.1.1 |format=PDF |accessdate=18 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111201928/http://l.yimg.com/t/icccricket/pdfs/test_playing_conditions.pdf |archivedate=11 January 2012  }}</ref> the final session may be extended by 30 minutes (except on the 5th day) if the umpires believe the result can be decided within that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://l.yimg.com/t/icccricket/pdfs/test_playing_conditions.pdf |title=Playing Conditions cl 16.2 |format=PDF |accessdate=18 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111201928/http://l.yimg.com/t/icccricket/pdfs/test_playing_conditions.pdf |archivedate=11 January 2012  }}</ref>\n\nToday, Test matches are scheduled to be played across five consecutive days. However, in the [[History of Test cricket (to 1883)|early days]] of Test cricket, matches were played for three or four days.

In each innings, one team [[Batting (cricket)|bats]] and the other [[Bowling (cricket)|bowls]] (or [[Fielding (cricket)|fields]]). Ordinarily four innings are played in a Test match, and each team bats twice and bowls twice. Before the start of play on the first day, the two team captains and the match referee [[the toss|toss a coin]]; the captain who wins the toss decides whether his team will bat or bowl first.\n\nIn the following scenarios, the team that bats first is referred to as ''Team A'' and their opponents as ''Team B''.\n\nUsually the teams will alternate at the completion of each innings. Thus, Team A will bat (and Team B will bowl) until its innings ends, and then Team B will bat and Team A will bowl. When Team B's innings ends, Team A begin their second innings, and this is followed by Team B's second innings. The winning team is the one that scores more runs in their two innings.\n\nA team's innings ends in one of the following ways:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-13-innings/ |title=LAW 13 - INNINGS |publisher=Lords.org |accessdate=22 December 2017}}</ref>\n* The team is \"all out\". This typically occurs when a team has lost ten wickets (ten of the eleven batsmen having been [[Dismissal (cricket)|dismissed]]) and are \"bowled out\". It may occasionally occur with the loss of fewer wickets if one or more batsmen are unavailable to bat (through injury, for example).\n* The team's captain [[Declaration and forfeiture|declares]] the innings closed, usually because they believe they have enough runs. A declaration before the innings starts is called an innings forfeiture.\n* The team batting fourth score the required number of runs to win.\n* The prescribed time for the match expires.\n\nIf, at the completion of its first innings, Team B's first innings total is 200 or more fewer than Team A's, the captain of Team A may (but is not required to) order Team B to have ''their'' second innings next. This is called enforcing the [[follow on]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-14-the-follow-on/ |title=Law 14 \u2013 The follow-on |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}</ref> In this case, the usual order of the third and fourth innings is reversed: Team A will bat in the fourth innings. It is rare for a team forced to follow on to win the match. In Test cricket it has only happened three times, although over 285 follow-ons have been enforced: Australia was the losing team on each occasion, twice to England, in 1894 and in 1981, and once to India in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Matches/MatchFollowOn.asp?FollowOn=T&Result=Lost |title=HowSTAT! Winning after Following-On |publisher=Howstat.com |accessdate=22 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIf the whole of the first day's play of a Test match has been lost because of bad weather or other reasons like bad light, then Team A may enforce the follow on if Team B's first innings total is 150 or more fewer than Team A's. During the [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2013#2nd Test|2nd Test]] between England and New Zealand at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] in 2013, England batted first after the first day was lost because of rain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/566922.html |title=2nd Test: England v New Zealand at Leeds, May 24\u201328, 2013 &#124; Cricket Scorecard |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=18 July 2013}}</ref> New Zealand, batting second, scored 180 runs fewer than England, meaning England could have enforced the follow on, though chose not to. This is similar to four-day first-class cricket, where the follow on can be enforced if the difference is 150 runs or fewer. If the Test is 2 days or fewer then the \"follow-on\" value is 100 runs.\n\nAfter 80 overs, the captain of the bowling side may take a [[Cricket ball|new ball]], although this is not required.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-4-the-ball/ |title=Law 4 \u2013 The ball |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}</ref> The captain will usually take the new ball: being harder and smoother than an old ball, a new ball generally favours faster bowlers who can make it bounce more variably. The roughened, softer surface of an old ball can be more conducive to spin bowlers, or those using [[reverse swing]]. The captain may delay the decision to take the new ball if he wishes to continue with his spinners (because the pitch favours spin). After a new ball has been taken, should an innings last a further 80 overs, then the captain will have the option to take another new ball.\n\nA Test match may end in one of six [[Result (cricket)|results]]:\n*'''All four innings are complete.''' The team batting fourth are ''all out'' before overtaking the other team, usually before matching the other team's score. The team that batted third are the winners by a margin equal to the difference in the aggregate runs scored by the two teams (for example, \"Team A won by 95 runs\"). Very rarely (in over 2,000 Test matches played, [[Tied Test|it has only happened twice]]) the scores can end level, resulting in a [[Tie (cricket)|tie]].\n*'''The team batting in the fourth innings overtakes the opposing team's run total.''' The match ends, and the team batting fourth is the winner by a margin equal to the number of wickets still to fall in the innings (for example, \"Team B won by five wickets\").\n*'''The third innings concludes with the team that batted twice still trailing the team that batted once.''' The match ends without playing a fourth innings. The team that batted only once is the winner by a margin equal to \"an innings\" plus the difference in aggregate run totals of the teams (for example, \"Team B won by an innings and 26 runs\").\n*'''Time for the match expires without a result being reached.''' This usually occurs at the end of the last day of the match. The result is a [[Draw (cricket)|draw]]: there is no winner, no matter how superior the position of one of the sides.

Often there is a perpetual trophy that is awarded to the winner, the most famous of which is [[the Ashes]] contested between England and Australia. There have been two exceptions to the bilateral nature of Test cricket: the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]], a three-way competition between England, Australia and South Africa (hosted by England), and the [[Asian Test Championship]], an event held in 1998\u201399 and 2001\u201302.\n\nThe number of matches in Test series has varied from one to seven.<ref name=\"Seven tests\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63065.html |title=Australia v England, Seventh Test, 1970\u201371 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=18 July 2013}}</ref> Up until the early 1990s,<ref name=\"Neutral umpires\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/511175.html|title=Neutral umpires|last=Rajesh|first=S.|date=16 April 2011|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref> Test series between international teams were organised between the two national cricket organisations with [[Umpire (cricket)|umpires]] provided by the home team. With the entry of more countries into Test cricket, and a wish by the ICC to maintain public interest in Tests in the face of the popularity of [[one-day cricket]], a rotation system was introduced that sees all ten Test teams playing each other over a six-year cycle, and an official [[ICC Test Championship|ranking system]] (with a trophy held by the highest-ranked team). In this system, umpires are provided by the ICC. An [[Elite Panel of ICC Umpires|elite panel of eleven umpires]] was maintained since 2002, and the panel is supplemented by an additional [[ICC International umpire panel|International Panel]] that includes three umpires named by each Test-playing country. The elite umpires officiate almost all Test matches, though usually not Tests involving their home country.\n\n====Perpetual trophies====\nSeveral pairs of Test teams have established perpetual trophies which are competed for whenever teams play each other in Test series.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left; width:95%\"\n|-\n!

Early international cricket was disrupted by the [[French Revolution]] and the [[American Civil War]].

Tours of national English sides abroad took place, particularly to the US, Australia and New Zealand. The [[Australian Aborigines]] team became the first organised overseas cricketers to [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868|tour England]] in [[1868 English cricket season|1868]].\n\nTwo rival English tours of Australia were proposed in the early months of 1877, with [[James Lillywhite]] campaigning for a professional tour and [[Fred Grace]] for an amateur one. Grace's tour fell through and it was Lillywhite's team that toured New Zealand and Australia in 1876\u201377. Two matches against a combined Australian XI were later classified as the first official Test matches. The first match was won by Australia, by 45 runs and the second by England. After reciprocal tours established a pattern of international cricket, [[The Ashes]] was established as a competition during the Australian tour of England in 1882. Surprisingly beaten, a mock obituary of English cricket was published in the ''Sporting Times'' the following day: the phrase \"The body shall be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\" prompted the subsequent creation of the Ashes urn. The series of 1884\u201385 was the first to be held over five matches: Shaw, writing in 1901, considered the side to be \"the best ever to have left England\".\n\nSouth Africa became the third team to play Test cricket in 1888\u201389, when they hosted a tour by an under-strength England side.\n\n==Test status==\nTest matches are the highest level of cricket, played between national representative teams with \"Test status\", as determined by the [[International Cricket Council]]. {{As of|June 2017}}, twelve national teams have Test status, the most recently promoted being Afghanistan and Ireland on 22 June 2017.<ref name=AI_test>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/40364481 |title=Ireland & Afghanistan awarded Test status by International Cricket Council |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=22 June 2017 |website=BBC News |publisher= |access-date=22 June 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Teams with Test status===\nTest status is conferred upon a country or group of countries by the ICC.

Performances in first-class matches count towards only the first-class statistical record, but performances in Test matches count towards both the Test statistics and the first-class statistics.\n\nStatisticians have developed criteria to determine which matches count as Tests, if they were played before the formal definition of Test status. The first list of matches considered to be \"Tests\" was drawn up by Clarence Moody, an Australian, in the mid-1890s. Representative matches played by simultaneous England touring sides of 1891\u201392 ([[English cricket team in Australia in 1891\u201392|in Australia]] and [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1891\u201392|South Africa]]) and 1929\u201330 ([[English cricket team in the West Indies in 1929\u201330|in the West Indies]] and [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 1929\u201330|New Zealand]]) are deemed to have \"Test status\".\n\nIn 1970, a series of five \"Test matches\" was played in England between England and a Rest of the World XI. These matches, originally scheduled between England and South Africa, were amended after South Africa was suspended from international cricket because of their government's policy of [[apartheid]]. Although initially given Test status (and included as Test matches in some record books, including ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]''), this was later withdrawn and a principle was established that official Test matches can only be between nations (although the geographically and demographically small countries of the West Indies have since 1928 been permitted to field a coalition side). Despite this, in 2005, the ICC ruled that the six-day [[ICC Super Series 2005|Super Series]] match that took place in October 2005, between Australia and a World XI, was an official Test match. Some cricket writers and statisticians, including [[Bill Frindall]], ignored the ICC's ruling and excluded the 2005 match from their records.

However, in the [[History of Test cricket (to 1883)|early days]] of Test cricket, matches were played for three or four days. Four-day Test matches were last played in 1973, between [[Pakistani cricket team in New Zealand in 1972\u201373|New Zealand and Pakistan]].<ref name=\"NZPak\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/21814480/cremer-senses-opportunity-shorter-contest |title=Cremer senses opportunity in shorter contest |accessdate=19 December 2017 |work=ESPN Cricinfo}}</ref> Until the 1980s, it was usual to include a 'rest day,' often a Sunday. There have also been '[[Timeless Test]]s', which have no predetermined maximum time. In 2005, Australia played a match scheduled for six days against a World XI, which the ICC sanctioned as an official Test match, though the match reached a conclusion on the fourth day. In October 2017, the ICC approved a request for a four-day Test match, between [[Zimbabwean cricket team in South Africa in 2017\u201318#Only Test|South Africa and Zimbabwe]], which started on 26 December 2017 and ended on the second day, 27 December.<ref name=\"approve\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/21006055/test-odi-leagues-approved-icc-board |title=Test, ODI leagues approved by ICC Board |accessdate=13 October 2017 |work=ESPN Cricinfo}}</ref> The ICC trialed the four-day Test format until the [[2019 Cricket World Cup]].<ref name=\"trial\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/21008545/south-africa-play-zimbawe-inaugural-four-day-test |title=South Africa to play Zimbabwe in inaugural four-day Test |accessdate=13 October 2017 |work=ESPN Cricinfo}}</ref> In December 2019, [[Cricket Australia]] were considering playing four-day Tests, subject to consensus with other Test nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/sport/cricket/australian-cricket-board-to-seriously-consider-four-day-test-matches-1.957158 |title=Australian cricket board to 'seriously consider' four-day Test matches |work=The National |accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref> Later the same month, the ICC considered the possibility of making four-day Test matches mandatory for the [[ICC World Test Championship]] from 2023.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28394321/icc-consider-mandatory-four-day-tests |title=ICC to consider mandatory four-day Tests |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere have been attempts by the ICC, the sport's governing body, to introduce day-night Test matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/397240.html |title=Lord's could host first day night Test in May 2010 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=18 July 2013}}</ref> In 2012, The International Cricket Council passed playing conditions that allowed for the staging of day-night Test matches.<ref name=\"ICC paves way for Day-Night Tests\"/> The first day-night Test took place during [[New Zealand cricket team in Australia in 2015\u201316|New Zealand's tour to Australia]] in November 2015.<ref name=\"Adelaide\" />\n\n===Play===\n{{further|Cricket#Rules and game-play}}\n\nTest cricket is played in ''innings'' (the word denotes both the singular and the plural). In each innings, one team [[Batting (cricket)|bats]] and the other [[Bowling (cricket)|bowls]] (or [[Fielding (cricket)|fields]]). Ordinarily four innings are played in a Test match, and each team bats twice and bowls twice. Before the start of play on the first day, the two team captains and the match referee [[the toss|toss a coin]]; the captain who wins the toss decides whether his team will bat or bowl first.\n\nIn the following scenarios, the team that bats first is referred to as ''Team A'' and their opponents as ''Team B''.\n\nUsually the teams will alternate at the completion of each innings. Thus, Team A will bat (and Team B will bowl) until its innings ends, and then Team B will bat and Team A will bowl. When Team B's innings ends, Team A begin their second innings, and this is followed by Team B's second innings. The winning team is the one that scores more runs in their two innings.\n\nA team's innings ends in one of the following ways:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-13-innings/ |title=LAW 13 - INNINGS |publisher=Lords.org |accessdate=22 December 2017}}</ref>\n* The team is \"all out\". This typically occurs when a team has lost ten wickets (ten of the eleven batsmen having been [[Dismissal (cricket)|dismissed]]) and are \"bowled out\". It may occasionally occur with the loss of fewer wickets if one or more batsmen are unavailable to bat (through injury, for example).\n* The team's captain [[Declaration and forfeiture|declares]] the innings closed, usually because they believe they have enough runs. A declaration before the innings starts is called an innings forfeiture.\n* The team batting fourth score the required number of runs to win.\n* The prescribed time for the match expires.\n\nIf, at the completion of its first innings, Team B's first innings total is 200 or more fewer than Team A's, the captain of Team A may (but is not required to) order Team B to have ''their'' second innings next. This is called enforcing the [[follow on]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-14-the-follow-on/ |title=Law 14 \u2013 The follow-on |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}</ref> In this case, the usual order of the third and fourth innings is reversed: Team A will bat in the fourth innings. It is rare for a team forced to follow on to win the match. In Test cricket it has only happened three times, although over 285 follow-ons have been enforced: Australia was the losing team on each occasion, twice to England, in 1894 and in 1981, and once to India in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Matches/MatchFollowOn.asp?FollowOn=T&Result=Lost |title=HowSTAT! Winning after Following-On |publisher=Howstat.com |accessdate=22 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIf the whole of the first day's play of a Test match has been lost because of bad weather or other reasons like bad light, then Team A may enforce the follow on if Team B's first innings total is 150 or more fewer than Team A's. During the [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2013#2nd Test|2nd Test]] between England and New Zealand at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] in 2013, England batted first after the first day was lost because of rain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/566922.html |title=2nd Test: England v New Zealand at Leeds, May 24\u201328, 2013 &#124; Cricket Scorecard |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=18 July 2013}}</ref> New Zealand, batting second, scored 180 runs fewer than England, meaning England could have enforced the follow on, though chose not to. This is similar to four-day first-class cricket, where the follow on can be enforced if the difference is 150 runs or fewer. If the Test is 2 days or fewer then the \"follow-on\" value is 100 runs.\n\nAfter 80 overs, the captain of the bowling side may take a [[Cricket ball|new ball]], although this is not required.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-4-the-ball/ |title=Law 4 \u2013 The ball |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}</ref> The captain will usually take the new ball: being harder and smoother than an old ball, a new ball generally favours faster bowlers who can make it bounce more variably. The roughened, softer surface of an old ball can be more conducive to spin bowlers, or those using [[reverse swing]]. The captain may delay the decision to take the new ball if he wishes to continue with his spinners (because the pitch favours spin). After a new ball has been taken, should an innings last a further 80 overs, then the captain will have the option to take another new ball.\n\nA Test match may end in one of six [[Result (cricket)|results]]:\n*'''All four innings are complete.''' The team batting fourth are ''all out'' before overtaking the other team, usually before matching the other team's score. The team that batted third are the winners by a margin equal to the difference in the aggregate runs scored by the two teams (for example, \"Team A won by 95 runs\"). Very rarely (in over 2,000 Test matches played, [[Tied Test|it has only happened twice]]) the scores can end level, resulting in a [[Tie (cricket)|tie]].\n*'''The team batting in the fourth innings overtakes the opposing team's run total.''' The match ends, and the team batting fourth is the winner by a margin equal to the number of wickets still to fall in the innings (for example, \"Team B won by five wickets\").\n*'''The third innings concludes with the team that batted twice still trailing the team that batted once.''' The match ends without playing a fourth innings. The team that batted only once is the winner by a margin equal to \"an innings\" plus the difference in aggregate run totals of the teams (for example, \"Team B won by an innings and 26 runs\").\n*'''Time for the match expires without a result being reached.''' This usually occurs at the end of the last day of the match. The result is a [[Draw (cricket)|draw]]: there is no winner, no matter how superior the position of one of the sides. Rain causing a loss of playing time is a common factor in drawn matches, although matches may be drawn even without interference from the weather: usually as a result of poor time management or an intentional effort on the part of one team to avoid losing.\n*'''The match is abandoned because the ground is declared unfit for play.'''  This has occurred three times, resulting each time in a draw being declared: England v Australia at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]], [[Leeds]], 1975 (vandalism);<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/19/newsid_2534000/2534763.stm |work=BBC News  | title=On This Day: 19 August | accessdate=18 December 2010}}</ref> West Indies v England at [[Sabina Park]], [[Kingston, Jamaica]], 1998 (dangerous ground);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63783.html |title=1st Test: West Indies v England at Kingston, Jan 29 \u2013 Feb 2, 1998 &#124; Cricket Scorecard |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=18 July 2013}}</ref> West Indies v England at [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]], [[Antigua]], 2009 (dangerous ground).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wiveng2009/engine/current/match/352662.html |title=2nd Test: West Indies v England at North Sound, Feb 13\u201317, 2009 &#124; Cricket Scorecard |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=18 July 2013}}</ref>\n*'''The match is awarded through a forfeiture.'''

Often there is a perpetual trophy that is awarded to the winner, the most famous of which is [[the Ashes]] contested between England and Australia. There have been two exceptions to the bilateral nature of Test cricket: the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]], a three-way competition between England, Australia and South Africa (hosted by England), and the [[Asian Test Championship]], an event held in 1998\u201399 and 2001\u201302.\n\nThe number of matches in Test series has varied from one to seven.<ref name=\"Seven tests\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63065.html |title=Australia v England, Seventh Test, 1970\u201371 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=18 July 2013}}</ref> Up until the early 1990s,<ref name=\"Neutral umpires\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/511175.html|title=Neutral umpires|last=Rajesh|first=S.|date=16 April 2011|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref> Test series between international teams were organised between the two national cricket organisations with [[Umpire (cricket)|umpires]] provided by the home team. With the entry of more countries into Test cricket, and a wish by the ICC to maintain public interest in Tests in the face of the popularity of [[one-day cricket]], a rotation system was introduced that sees all ten Test teams playing each other over a six-year cycle, and an official [[ICC Test Championship|ranking system]] (with a trophy held by the highest-ranked team). In this system, umpires are provided by the ICC. An [[Elite Panel of ICC Umpires|elite panel of eleven umpires]] was maintained since 2002, and the panel is supplemented by an additional [[ICC International umpire panel|International Panel]] that includes three umpires named by each Test-playing country. The elite umpires officiate almost all Test matches, though usually not Tests involving their home country.\n\n====Perpetual trophies====\nSeveral pairs of Test teams have established perpetual trophies which are competed for whenever teams play each other in Test series.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left; width:95%\"\n|-\n!
