The region plays a vital role in India's economy as it supplies nearly two third of India's total oil import, bilateral trade is also flourishing in recent years particularly with UAE and other Gulf states. Over the years millions of Indians mostly working class have migrated to the gulf looking for jobs and they account for a sizeable share in the total remittances received from abroad.\n\n===Link West policy===\nIn an attempt to strengthen ties with India's western neighbors specially the [[Persian gulf|gulf countries]], Modi proposed this policy to complement his [[Act East policy]] concerning East Asia.
