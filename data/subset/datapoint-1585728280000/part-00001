His second term expired at noon on January 20, 1961.]]\nThe '''1960 United States presidential election''' was the 44th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. It was held on Tuesday, November 8, 1960. In a closely contested election, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[John F. Kennedy]] defeated incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee. This was the first election in which fifty states participated and the last in which the [[District of Columbia]] did not. It was also the first election in which an incumbent president was ineligible to run for a third term because of the term limits established by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]]. It is also the last election where the losing candidate won [[Ohio]].\n\nNixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Kennedy, a junior [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], established himself as the Democratic front-runner with his strong performance in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1960|1960 Democratic primaries]], including a key victory in [[West Virginia]] over [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Hubert Humphrey]]. He defeated Senate Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on the first presidential ballot of the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], and asked Johnson to serve as his running mate. The issue of the [[Cold War]] dominated the election, as tensions were high between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nKennedy won a 303 to 219 [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] victory and is generally considered to have won the national popular vote by 112,827, a margin of 0.17 percent, though some argue that Nixon should be credited with the popular vote victory,<ref>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/10/19/did_jfk_lose_the_popular_vote_115833.html</ref> as the issue of the popular vote was complicated by the presence of several [[unpledged elector]]s in the [[Deep South]]. Fourteen unpledged electors from [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] cast their vote for Senator [[Harry F. Byrd]], as did a [[faithless elector]] from [[Oklahoma]]. The 1960 presidential election was the closest election since [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]], and this closeness can be explained by a number of factors.<ref>Rorabaugh (2009)</ref> Kennedy benefited from the [[Recession of 1958|economic recession of 1957\u201358]], which hurt the standing of the [[incumbent]] Republican Party, and he had the advantage of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ann Mari |last=May |title=President Eisenhower, Economic Policy, and the 1960 Presidential Election |journal=[[Journal of Economic History]] |volume=50 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=417\u2013427 |jstor=2123282 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700036536|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&context=cbafacpub }}</ref> Furthermore, the new votes that Kennedy, the first [[Roman Catholic]] president, gained among Catholics almost neutralized the new votes Nixon gained among [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestants]].<ref>Casey (2009)</ref> Kennedy's campaigning skills decisively outmatched Nixon's, who wasted time and resources campaigning in all fifty states while Kennedy focused on campaigning in populous [[swing states]].

Several other candidates sought support in their home state or region as \"[[favorite son]]\" candidates without any realistic chance of winning the nomination. Symington, Stevenson, and Johnson all declined to campaign in the presidential primaries. While this reduced their potential delegate count going into the Democratic National Convention, each of these three candidates hoped that the other leading contenders would stumble in the primaries, thus causing the convention's delegates to choose him as a \"compromise\" candidate acceptable to all factions of the party.\n\nKennedy was initially dogged by suggestions from some [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] elders (such as former [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], who was supporting Symington) that he was too youthful and inexperienced to be president; these critics suggested that he should agree to be the [[running mate]] for another Democrat. Realizing that this was a strategy touted by his opponents to keep the public from taking him seriously, Kennedy stated frankly, \"I'm not running for vice president, I'm running for president.\"<ref>[[Jeff Zeleny|Zeleny, Jeff]]; Bosman, Julie (March 11, 2008).

Kennedy's [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religion was an issue. Kennedy first challenged Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey in the Wisconsin primary and defeated him. Kennedy's attractive sisters, brothers, and wife Jacqueline combed the state looking for votes, leading Humphrey to complain that he \"felt like an independent merchant competing against a chain store.\"<ref>Humphrey, Hubert H.

The first televised debate of 1960 was held in West Virginia, and Kennedy outperformed Humphrey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/EventDetail.html?EventID=43 |title=Our Campaigns \u2013 Event \u2013 Kennedy-Humphrey Primary Debate \u2013 May 4, 1960 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=November 4, 2008}}</ref> Humphrey's campaign was low on funds and could not compete for advertising and other \"get-out-the-vote\" drives with Kennedy's well-financed and well-organized campaign. In the end, Kennedy defeated Humphrey with over 60% of the vote, and Humphrey ended his presidential campaign. [[West Virginia]] showed that Kennedy, a Catholic, could win in a heavily Protestant state.

Even though Stevenson had twice been the Democratic Party's presidential candidate and retained a loyal following of liberals, his two landslide defeats to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower]] led most party leaders and delegates to search for a \"fresh face\" who could win a national election. Following the primaries, Kennedy traveled around the nation speaking to state delegations and their leaders. As the Democratic Convention opened, Kennedy was far in the lead, but was still seen as being just short of the delegate total he needed to win.\n\n====Democratic convention====\nThe [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] was held in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]. In the week before the convention opened, Kennedy received two new challengers when Lyndon B. Johnson, the powerful [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] from Texas, and Adlai Stevenson, the party's nominee in 1952 and 1956, officially announced their candidacies (they had both privately been working for the nomination for some time). However, neither Johnson nor Stevenson was a match for the talented and highly efficient Kennedy campaign team led by [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Johnson challenged Kennedy to a televised debate before a joint meeting of the Texas and Massachusetts delegations, to which Kennedy accepted. Most observers believed that Kennedy won the debate, and Johnson was unable to expand his delegate support beyond the South. Stevenson's failure to launch his candidacy publicly until the week of the convention meant that many liberal delegates who might have supported him were already pledged to Kennedy, and Stevenson\u2014despite the energetic support of former First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]\u2014could not break their allegiance. Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot.\n\nThen, in a move that surprised many, Kennedy asked Johnson to be his running mate. He realized that he could not be elected without the support of traditional [[Southern Democrats]], most of whom had backed Johnson. He offered Johnson the vice presidential nomination at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel]] at 10:15&nbsp;a.m. on July 14, 1960, the morning after being nominated for president.<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135.

[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], and [[Seymour Hersh]] quoted Robert Kennedy's version of events, writing that John Kennedy \"would have preferred [[Stuart Symington]] as his [[running-mate]]\" and that Johnson teamed with [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]] to \"pressure Kennedy to offer the nomination\". Hersh goes on to present an alternative version of events; he writes that Kennedy was essentially blackmailed into offering the vice presidency to Johnson. The same story was originally presented by [[Anthony Summers]] in his biography of FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. [[Evelyn Lincoln]], Kennedy's personal secretary, told Summers in an interview that she was convinced in mid-1960 that J. Edgar Hoover and Johnson had conspired. Hoover was known to keep detailed files on the personal lives of many political figures and Kennedy was no exception. Hoover obtained information about Jack's womanizing prior to the election from at least two different sources. In January 1942, while Jack was serving in the [[United States Navy]], FBI surveillance records confirmed that he was having an affair with a woman named [[Inga Arvad]]; then, in 1958, a couple named Leonard and Florence Kater found out that their tenant, [[Pamela Turnure]], a secretary in Kennedy's Senate office, had been having an affair with the soon-to-be president. The Katers rigged up a tape recorder to pick up the sounds of the couple's lovemaking and snapped a picture of Kennedy himself. The Katers sent this information to the newspapers and one company - Stearn Publications - passed it along to Hoover. Soon after, \"he quietly obtained a copy of the compromising sex tapes and offered them to Lyndon Johnson as campaign ammunition.\" Lincoln said that Johnson \"had been using all the information Hoover could find on Kennedy - during the campaign, even before the Convention. And Hoover was in on the pressure on Kennedy at the Convention.\" A few days after the offer was made, [[Pierre Salinger]], the campaign's press secretary, had asked Jack Kennedy whether he really expected Johnson to accept the offer or if he was merely making a polite gesture. Kennedy responded cryptically: \"The whole story will never be known. And it's just as well that it won't be.\" \"The only people who were involved in the discussions were Jack and myself,\" said Robert Kennedy. \"We both promised each other that we'd never tell what happened.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J.

Hersh]], ''The Dark Side of Camelot'', 1997, Chapter 12</ref>\n\nBiographers [[Robert Caro]] and [[W. Marvin Watson]] offer a different perspective; they write that the Kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast to be a very close race against [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]]. Johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry votes from Texas and the [[Southern United States]]. Caro's research showed that on July 14, Kennedy started the process while Johnson was still asleep. At 6:30&nbsp;a.m., Kennedy asked his brother to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes, \"including Texas.\"<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> Robert Kennedy called [[Pierre Salinger]] and [[Kenneth O'Donnell]] to assist him. Realizing the ramifications of counting Texas votes as their own, Salinger asked him whether he was considering a Kennedy-Johnson ticket, and Robert replied, \"yes\".<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> Between 9 and 10 a.m., John Kennedy called Pennsylvania governor [[David L. Lawrence]], a Johnson backer, to request that Lawrence nominate Johnson for vice president if Johnson were to accept the role and then went to Johnson's suite to discuss a mutual ticket at 10:15&nbsp;a.m. John Kennedy then returned to his suite to announce the Kennedy-Johnson ticket to his closest supporters and Northern political bosses. He accepted the congratulations of [[List of governors of Ohio|Ohio Governor]] [[Michael DiSalle]], [[List of governors of Connecticut|Connecticut Governor]] [[Abraham A. Ribicoff]], [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]], and [[Mayor of New York City|New York City mayor]] [[Robert F. Wagner Jr.]]. Lawrence said that \"Johnson has the strength where you need it most\"; he then left to begin writing the nomination speech.<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> O'Donnell remembers being angry at what he considered a betrayal by John Kennedy, who had previously cast Johnson as anti-labor and anti-liberal. Afterward, Robert Kennedy visited with labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of Johnson and after seeing the depth of labor opposition to Johnson, he ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and Johnson, apparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without John Kennedy's authorization and to get Johnson to agree to be the Democratic Party chairman rather than vice president. Johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from John Kennedy. Despite his brother's interference, John Kennedy was firm that Johnson was who he wanted as running mate and met with staffers such as [[Larry O'Brien]], his national campaign manager, to say Johnson was to be vice president. O'Brien recalled later that John Kennedy's words were wholly unexpected, but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation, he thought \"it was a stroke of genius\".<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135.

However, Rockefeller announced that he would not be a candidate for president after a national tour revealed that the great majority of Republicans favored Nixon.<ref>(White, pp. 91\u201392)</ref>\n\nAfter Rockefeller's withdrawal, Nixon faced no significant opposition for the Republican nomination. At the [[1960 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], Nixon was the overwhelming choice of the delegates, with conservative Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] from Arizona receiving 10 votes from conservative delegates. In earning the nomination, Nixon became the first sitting vice president to run for president since [[John C. Breckinridge]] exactly a century prior. Nixon then chose former Massachusetts Senator and [[United Nations]] Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], as his vice presidential running mate. Nixon chose Lodge because his foreign-policy credentials fit into Nixon's strategy to campaign more on foreign policy than domestic policy, which he believed favored the Democrats. Nixon had previously sought Rockefeller as his running mate, but the governor had no ambitions to be vice president.

He promised that the new Democratic administration would fully appreciate the importance of space accomplishments for the national security and international prestige of the United States. Nixon responded that, if elected, he would continue the \"peace and prosperity\" that Eisenhower had brought the nation in the 1950s.  Nixon also argued that with the nation engaged in the Cold War with the Soviets, that Kennedy was too young and inexperienced to be trusted with the presidency. Had Nixon been elected, at 48 years, 11 days, he would have been [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|the fourth-youngest]] president at the date of inauguration. Kennedy, by contrast, was 43 years, 236 days, on the date of his inauguration; the second-youngest man to begin a Presidency (at 42 [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who [[First inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt|assumed the Presidency]] upon the [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassination of United States President William McKinley]] 60 years previously, was the youngest).\n\nDuring Kennedy's campaign he relied on his youth and promised to bring about change. Kennedy had a slogan emphasizing his youth reading, \"who's seasoned through and through/but not so dog-gone seasoned that he won't try something new.\" He was also endorsed by celebrities such as [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Harry Belafonte]]. Nixon relied on his experience in politics. He emphasized to the American voters that he was more qualified to hold the office of president.

However, Nixon was plagued by bad luck throughout the fall campaign. In August, President Eisenhower, who had long been ambivalent about Nixon, held a televised press conference in which a reporter, Charles Mohr of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', mentioned Nixon's claims that he had been a valuable administration insider and adviser. Mohr asked Eisenhower if he could give an example of a major idea of Nixon's that he had heeded. Eisenhower responded with the flip comment, \"If you give me a week, I might think of one.\"<ref>Ambrose, Stephen E. (1991). ''Eisenhower: Soldier and President'', p. 525. Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-74758-4}}.</ref> Although both Eisenhower and Nixon later claimed that he was merely joking with the reporter, the remark hurt Nixon, as it undercut his claims of having greater decision-making experience than Kennedy. The remark proved so damaging to Nixon that the Democrats turned Eisenhower's statement into a television commercial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nixon's Experience?

This pledge backfired when, in August, Nixon injured his knee on a car door while campaigning in [[North Carolina]]. The knee became infected and Nixon had to cease campaigning for two weeks while the infection was treated with [[Antibacterial|antibiotics]]. When he left [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]], Nixon refused to abandon his pledge to visit every state; he thus wound up wasting valuable time visiting states that he had no chance of winning, or that had few electoral votes and would be of little help at the election, or states that he would almost certainly win regardless. For example, in his effort to visit all 50 states, Nixon spent the vital weekend before the election campaigning in Alaska, which had only three electoral votes, while Kennedy campaigned in more populous states, such as New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.\n\nNixon visited Atlanta, Georgia on August 26 and acquired a very large turnout to his event. Nixon rode through a parade in Atlanta and was greeted by 150,000 people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=The Nixon-Kennedy Campaigns In Georgia|last=Fleming|first=K|date=November 1960|work=The Atlanta-Journal and Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> Nixon mentioned in his speech in Atlanta, \"in the last quarter of a century there hasn't been a Democratic candidate for President that has bothered to campaign in the State of Georgia.\"<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25759|title=John F.

Kennedy would change that statistic and visit some surprising states, including Georgia. Senator Kennedy visited the cities of Columbus, Warm Springs, and Lagrange on his campaign trail in Georgia. In his visit to Warm Springs, state troopers tried to keep Kennedy from an immense crowd, however Kennedy reached out to shake hands of those who were sick with polio.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Cheering Throng Engulfs Kennedy|last=Galphin|first=B|date=October 11, 1960|work=The Atlanta-Journal Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> He also visited small towns across Georgia on his trip and saw a mass of 100,000 people during the entire visit. Kennedy spoke at a rehabilitation facility in Warm Springs. Warm Springs was near and dear to Kennedy's heart due to the effects the facility had on [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt spent time at the rehabilitation facility and died there in 1945.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\"/>\n\nIn Warm Springs, Kennedy spoke to supporters at the facility and mentioned Franklin D. Roosevelt in his speech. He admired Roosevelt and commended him for sticking up for the farmers, workers, small towns, big cities, those in poverty, and those who were sick.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\" /> He said Roosevelt had a \"spirit of strength and progress to get America moving.\"<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\" /> Kennedy discussed his six-point plan for healthcare. He wanted a medical program set up for retirement and federal funding for the construction of medical schools and hospitals. He also planned for the government to loan students money to attend medical school and provide grants to renovate old hospitals. He called for more money to be spent on medical research and finally, expand effort for rehabilitation and come up with new ways to assist those in need.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\" /> Many Republicans disapproved Kennedy's plans and described them as an \"appeal to socialism\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Kennedy's Plans Altered: Crowd of 50,000 Is Seen|last=Gaines|first=Marion|date=October 6, 1960|work=The Atlanta-Journal Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> People around Warm Springs were supportive of Kennedy.

Nixon insisted on campaigning until just a few hours before the first debate started. He had not completely recovered from his stay in hospital and thus looked pale, sickly, underweight, and tired.<ref name=\"Nixon, p. 270\">(Nixon, p. 270)</ref> His eyes moved across the room during the debate, and at various moments sweat was visible on his face. He also refused make-up for the first debate, and as a result his facial stubble showed prominently on the black-and-white TV screens at the time. Furthermore, the debate set appeared darker once the paint dried up, causing Nixon's suit color to blend in with the background which reduced his stature.<ref name=\"Nixon, p. 270\"/> Nixon's poor appearance on television in the first debate is reflected by the fact that his mother called him immediately following the debate to ask if he was sick.<ref>(Nixon, p. 271)</ref>{{efn|name=\"addisons\"|His tanned appearance was likely darkening ([[hyperpigmentation]]) of the skin due to [[Addison's disease#Notable cases|Addison's disease]].

Contrary to popular belief, the Sindlinger evidence suggests not that Kennedy won on television but that the candidates tied on television while Nixon won on radio. However, no details about the sample have ever been reported, and it is unclear whether the survey results can be generalized to a larger population. Moreover, since 87% of American households had a television in 1960 [and that the] fraction of Americans lacking access to television in 1960 was concentrated in rural areas and particularly in southern and western states, places that were unlikely to hold significant proportions of Catholic voters.<ref name=schlinder>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.las.illinois.edu/salthaus/Publications/media%20and%20politics%20encyclopedia_kennedy-nixon%20debates.pdf|author=Scott L.

This debate was a monumental step for television. For the first time ever, split-screen technology was used to bring two people from opposite sides of the country together so they were able to converse in real time. Nixon was in Los Angeles while Kennedy was in New York. The men appear to be in the same room, thanks to identical sets. Both candidates had monitors in their respective studios containing the feed from the opposite studio so they could respond to questions. Bill Shadel moderated the debate from a third television studio in Chicago.

Some historians criticize Nixon for not taking greater advantage of Eisenhower's popularity (which was around 60\u201365% throughout 1960 and on election day) and for not discussing the prosperous economy of the Eisenhower presidency more often in his campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-08/uoc--int081409.php |title=It's not the economy, stupid \u2013 it's what you do with it |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date=August 14, 2009 |access-date=June 24, 2012}}</ref> As the campaign moved into the final two weeks, the polls and most political pundits predicted a Kennedy victory. However, President Eisenhower, who had largely sat out the campaign, made a vigorous campaign tour for Nixon over the last 10 days before the election.

Nixon also criticized Kennedy for stating that [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], two small islands off the coast of Communist China that were held by Nationalist Chinese forces based in Taiwan, were outside the treaty of protection the United States had signed with the Nationalist Chinese. Nixon claimed the islands were included in the treaty and accused Kennedy of showing weakness towards Communist aggression.<ref>(Ambrose, pp. 579\u2013580)</ref> Aided by the Quemoy and Matsu issue, and by Eisenhower's support, Nixon began to gain momentum and by election day the polls indicated a virtual tie.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Results===\n[[Image:PresidentialCounty1960Colorbrewer.gif|thumb|right|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage for the winning candidate.

However, as later returns came in from [[rural]] and [[suburban]] areas in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], the Rocky Mountain states and the Pacific Coast states, Nixon began to steadily close the gap on Kennedy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/business/media/no-concession-no-sleep-glued-to-the-tv-on-election-night-1960.html|title=No Concession, No Sleep: Glued to the TV on Election Night 1960|last=Beschloss|first=Michael|date=2016-10-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-01-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nBefore midnight, ''[[The New York Times]]'' had gone to press with the headline \"Kennedy Elected President\".

So close was the popular vote that a shift of 18,858 votes in Illinois and Missouri, both won by Kennedy by less than 1%, would have left both Kennedy and Nixon short of the 269 electoral votes required to win, thus forcing a contingent election in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219.

With Lyndon Johnson's help, he also carried most of the South, including the large states of North Carolina, Georgia, and Texas. Nixon carried all but three of the Western states (including California), and he ran strong in the farm belt states, where his biggest victory was in Ohio.\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'', summarizing the discussion in late November, spoke of a \"narrow consensus\" among the experts that Kennedy had won more than he lost \"as a result of his Catholicism\",<ref>''The New York Times'', November 20, 1960, Section 4, p.

Interviewing people who voted in both 1956 and 1960, a [[University of Michigan]] team analyzing the election returns discovered that people who voted Democratic in 1956 split 33\u20136 for Kennedy, while the Republican voters of 1956 split 44\u201317 for Nixon. That is, Nixon lost 28% ({{sfrac|17|61}}) of the Eisenhower voters, while Kennedy lost only 15% of the Stevenson voters.

Johnson was senator, and Illinois, home of Mayor [[Richard J. Daley|Richard Daley]]'s powerful [[Chicago political machine]].<ref name=\"salon\"/> These two states were important because if Nixon had carried both, he would have earned 270 electoral votes, one more than the 269 needed to win the majority in the Electoral College and the presidency. Republican senators such as [[Everett Dirksen]] and [[Barry Goldwater]] also thought that vote fraud \"played a role in the election\",<ref name=\"wash post\"/> and that Nixon actually won the national popular vote. Republicans tried and failed to overturn the results in both Illinois and Texas at the time, as well as in nine other states.<ref name=\"greenberg slate\">{{Cite journal| url = http://www.slate.com/id/91350/| last = Greenberg| first = David| authorlink = David Greenberg (writer)| title = Was Nixon Robbed?| journal = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| date = October 16, 2000 }}</ref> Some journalists also later claimed that mobster [[Sam Giancana]] and his [[Chicago Outfit|Chicago crime syndicate]] \"played a role\" in Kennedy's victory in Illinois.<ref name=\"greenberg slate\"/>\n\nNixon's campaign staff urged him to pursue recounts and challenge the validity of Kennedy's victory in several states, especially in Illinois, Missouri, and New Jersey, where large majorities in Catholic precincts handed Kennedy the election.<ref name=\"wash post\"/> However, Nixon gave a speech three days after the election stating that he would not contest the election.<ref name=\"wash post\"/> The Republican National Chairman, Senator [[Thruston Ballard Morton]] of Kentucky, visited [[Key Biscayne, Florida]], where Nixon had taken his family for a vacation, and pushed for a recount.<ref name=\"wash post\"/> Morton did challenge the results in 11 states,<ref name=\"salon\"/> keeping challenges in the courts into mid-1961; however, the only result of these challenges was the loss of Hawaii to Kennedy on a recount.\n\nKennedy won Illinois by less than 9,000 votes out of 4.75 million cast, or a margin of 0.2%.<ref name=\"salon\"/> However, Nixon carried 92 of the state's 101 counties.

Yet when the Republican [[Chicago Tribune]] went to press, 79 percent of Cook County precincts had reported, compared with just 62 percent of Illinois's precincts overall. Moreover, Nixon never led in Illinois, and Kennedy's lead merely shrank as election night went on.<ref name=\"wash post von hippel\"/> [[Earl Mazo]], a reporter for the pro-Nixon ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and his biographer, investigated the voting in Chicago and \"claimed to have discovered sufficient evidence of vote fraud to prove that the state was stolen for Kennedy.\"<ref name=\"salon\"/>\n\nIn Texas, Kennedy defeated Nixon by a 51 to 49% margin, or 46,000 votes.<ref name=\"salon\"/> Some Republicans argued that Johnson's formidable political machine had stolen enough votes in counties along the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexican border]] to give Kennedy the victory. Kennedy's defenders, such as his speechwriter and special assistant [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]], have argued that Kennedy's margin in Texas was simply too large for vote fraud to have been a decisive factor. Russell D. Renka, a former political science professor at Southeastern Missouri State University,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/rdrenka/|title=Renka's Home Page|publisher=}}</ref> acknowledged that it was more than likely that Johnson's political machine in the state's lower Rio Grande Valley counties, including the notorious [[Duval County, Texas|Duval County]], could have \"managed to produce a significant number of forged votes\" for Kennedy.<ref name=renka1960>[http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/renka/ui320-75/presidents/kennedy/1960_election.asp The 1960 Kennedy v.

For example, [[Fannin County, Texas|Fannin County]] had only 4,895 registered voters, yet 6,138 votes were cast in that county, three-quarters for Kennedy.<ref name=\"wash post\"/> In an [[Angelina County, Texas|Angelina County]] precinct, Kennedy received 187 votes to Nixon's 24, though there were only a total of 86 registered voters in the precinct.<ref name=\"wash post\"/>  When Republicans demanded a statewide recount, they learned that the state Board of Elections, whose members were all Democrats, had already \"certified\" Kennedy as the official winner in Texas.<ref name=\"wash post\"/> This analysis, though, is flawed as the fact was registered voter figures only measured individuals who had paid the [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]], and that certain groups were exempt from having to pay that tax.<ref>''The Houston Chronicle'', April 13, 2012, [https://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Vote-ID-law-is-a-waste-of-money-3481335.php \"Vote ID law is a waste of money\"] by Terri Burke</ref>\n\nIn Illinois, Schlesinger and others have pointed out that, even if Nixon had carried Illinois, the state alone would not have given him the victory, as Kennedy would still have won 276 electoral votes to Nixon's 246 (with 269 needed to win). More to the point, Illinois was the site of the most extensive challenge process, which fell short despite repeated efforts spearheaded by Cook County state's attorney, Benjamin Adamowski, a Republican, who also lost his re-election bid. Despite demonstrating net errors favoring both Nixon and Adamowski (some precincts\u201440% in Nixon's case\u2014showed errors favoring them, a factor suggesting error, rather than fraud), the totals found fell short of reversing the results for either candidate. While a Daley-connected circuit judge, Thomas Kluczynski (who would later be appointed a federal judge by Kennedy, at Daley's recommendation), threw out a federal lawsuit \"filed to contend\" the voting totals,<ref name=\"wash post\"/> the Republican-dominated State Board of Elections unanimously rejected the challenge to the results. Furthermore, there were signs of possible irregularities in downstate areas controlled by Republicans, which Democrats never seriously pressed, since the Republican challenges went nowhere.<ref>''Slate'', October 16, 2000, [http://www.slate.com/id/91350/ \"Was Nixon Robbed?

Instead of having the voters choose from slates of electors, the Alabama ballot had voters choose the [[US Presidential Electors|electors]] individually. Traditionally, in such a situation, a given candidate is assigned the popular vote of the elector who received the most votes. For instance, candidates pledged to Nixon received anywhere from 230,951 votes (for George Witcher) to 237,981 votes (for Cecil Durham); Nixon is therefore assigned 237,981 popular votes from Alabama.\n\nThe situation was more complicated on the Democratic side. The statewide Democratic primary had chosen eleven candidates for the Electoral College, five of whom were pledged to vote for Kennedy, and six of whom were free to vote for anyone they chose. All of these candidates won in the general election, and all six unpledged electors voted against Kennedy. The actual number of popular votes received by Kennedy is therefore difficult to allocate. Traditionally, Kennedy is assigned either 318,303 votes (the votes won by the most popular Kennedy elector) or 324,050 votes (the votes won by the most popular unpledged Democratic elector); the results table below is based on Kennedy winning 318,303 votes in Alabama.<ref name=\"trende\">{{cite news| title = Did JFK Lose the Popular Vote?| publisher = RealClearPolitics| date = October 22, 2012| url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/10/19/did_jfk_lose_the_popular_vote_115833.html| accessdate = October 23, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=====Georgia=====\nThe actual number of popular votes received by Kennedy and Nixon in Georgia is also difficult to determine because voters voted for 12 separate electors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Novotny|first1=Patrick|title=John F.

The average vote totals for the 12 electors were 455,629 votes for the Democratic electors and 273,110 votes for the Republican electors.

Alabama put up a mixed slate of five loyal electors and six unpledged electors. Mississippi put up two distinct slates, one of loyalists and one of unpledged electors. Louisiana also put up two distinct slates, although the unpledged slate did not receive the \"Democratic\" label. Georgia freed its Democratic electors from pledges to vote for Kennedy.

In addition, Byrd received one electoral vote from a faithless Oklahoma elector for a total of 15 electoral votes.

Garfield]] in 1880 to not carry California; since then, [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976, [[George W. Bush]] in 2000 and 2004, and [[Donald Trump]] in 2016, won the White House despite losing California.\n* This was the first election that Arizona participated in which it did not back the winning candidate.\n* Kennedy was the first Democrat to win the presidency without carrying Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma and Virginia, the last to win without Ohio and Wisconsin, and the first to win without Tennessee and Kentucky since 1852.\n* Kennedy is the last candidate from either party elected without carrying Ohio, and only [[Bill Clinton]] in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] has won without Florida since.\n* Since [[1840 United States presidential election|1840]], this is the second and most recent presidential election in which [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] have had a different popular vote victor. (Mississippi was also unable to vote in [[1868 United States presidential election|1868]] due to [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]). However, the majority of Alabama's electoral votes went to [[Harry F. Byrd]] instead of John F. Kennedy. All of Mississippi's electoral votes went to Byrd.\n* This election marked the first time since [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] that the Democratic candidate's share of the popular vote went up as opposed to down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/popular-vote/|title=Popular Votes 1940-2012 - Roper Center|publisher=}}</ref>\n* This was the first election where both major party candidates were born in the 20th century.\n* It marked the first election of two incumbent U.S. senators as president and vice president, a phenomenon that was repeated by [[Barack Obama]] and [[Joe Biden]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]]. In both instances, the President-elect was the younger of the two and also the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior senator]] from his state.\n* Kennedy was both the last Northern Democrat and sitting United States senator to win either the presidency or popular vote until the election of Barack Obama in 2008.\n* This was the first presidential election since [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]] that the incumbent Vice President was a presidential nominee.\n* Barry Goldwater was the only person to come in fourth for either President or vice president in the electoral college during the 20th century, and the first since 1872.\n* As of the 2016 Presidential Election this is the last time that Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee did not all vote for the same candidate.\n* This was the only presidential election where both major candidates were less than fifty years of age.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of the United States (1945\u20131964)]]\n* [[Inauguration of John F.

His second term expired at noon on January 20, 1961.]]\nThe '''1960 United States presidential election''' was the 44th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. It was held on Tuesday, November 8, 1960. In a closely contested election, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[John F. Kennedy]] defeated incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee. This was the first election in which fifty states participated and the last in which the [[District of Columbia]] did not. It was also the first election in which an incumbent president was ineligible to run for a third term because of the term limits established by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]]. It is also the last election where the losing candidate won [[Ohio]].\n\nNixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Kennedy, a junior [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], established himself as the Democratic front-runner with his strong performance in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1960|1960 Democratic primaries]], including a key victory in [[West Virginia]] over [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Hubert Humphrey]]. He defeated Senate Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on the first presidential ballot of the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], and asked Johnson to serve as his running mate. The issue of the [[Cold War]] dominated the election, as tensions were high between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nKennedy won a 303 to 219 [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] victory and is generally considered to have won the national popular vote by 112,827, a margin of 0.17 percent, though some argue that Nixon should be credited with the popular vote victory,<ref>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/10/19/did_jfk_lose_the_popular_vote_115833.html</ref> as the issue of the popular vote was complicated by the presence of several [[unpledged elector]]s in the [[Deep South]]. Fourteen unpledged electors from [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] cast their vote for Senator [[Harry F. Byrd]], as did a [[faithless elector]] from [[Oklahoma]]. The 1960 presidential election was the closest election since [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]], and this closeness can be explained by a number of factors.<ref>Rorabaugh (2009)</ref> Kennedy benefited from the [[Recession of 1958|economic recession of 1957\u201358]], which hurt the standing of the [[incumbent]] Republican Party, and he had the advantage of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ann Mari |last=May |title=President Eisenhower, Economic Policy, and the 1960 Presidential Election |journal=[[Journal of Economic History]] |volume=50 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=417\u2013427 |jstor=2123282 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700036536|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&context=cbafacpub }}</ref> Furthermore, the new votes that Kennedy, the first [[Roman Catholic]] president, gained among Catholics almost neutralized the new votes Nixon gained among [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestants]].<ref>Casey (2009)</ref> Kennedy's campaigning skills decisively outmatched Nixon's, who wasted time and resources campaigning in all fifty states while Kennedy focused on campaigning in populous [[swing states]].

Several other candidates sought support in their home state or region as \"[[favorite son]]\" candidates without any realistic chance of winning the nomination. Symington, Stevenson, and Johnson all declined to campaign in the presidential primaries. While this reduced their potential delegate count going into the Democratic National Convention, each of these three candidates hoped that the other leading contenders would stumble in the primaries, thus causing the convention's delegates to choose him as a \"compromise\" candidate acceptable to all factions of the party.\n\nKennedy was initially dogged by suggestions from some [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] elders (such as former [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], who was supporting Symington) that he was too youthful and inexperienced to be president; these critics suggested that he should agree to be the [[running mate]] for another Democrat. Realizing that this was a strategy touted by his opponents to keep the public from taking him seriously, Kennedy stated frankly, \"I'm not running for vice president, I'm running for president.\"<ref>[[Jeff Zeleny|Zeleny, Jeff]]; Bosman, Julie (March 11, 2008).

Kennedy's [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religion was an issue. Kennedy first challenged Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey in the Wisconsin primary and defeated him. Kennedy's attractive sisters, brothers, and wife Jacqueline combed the state looking for votes, leading Humphrey to complain that he \"felt like an independent merchant competing against a chain store.\"<ref>Humphrey, Hubert H.

The first televised debate of 1960 was held in West Virginia, and Kennedy outperformed Humphrey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/EventDetail.html?EventID=43 |title=Our Campaigns \u2013 Event \u2013 Kennedy-Humphrey Primary Debate \u2013 May 4, 1960 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=November 4, 2008}}</ref> Humphrey's campaign was low on funds and could not compete for advertising and other \"get-out-the-vote\" drives with Kennedy's well-financed and well-organized campaign. In the end, Kennedy defeated Humphrey with over 60% of the vote, and Humphrey ended his presidential campaign. [[West Virginia]] showed that Kennedy, a Catholic, could win in a heavily Protestant state.

Even though Stevenson had twice been the Democratic Party's presidential candidate and retained a loyal following of liberals, his two landslide defeats to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower]] led most party leaders and delegates to search for a \"fresh face\" who could win a national election. Following the primaries, Kennedy traveled around the nation speaking to state delegations and their leaders. As the Democratic Convention opened, Kennedy was far in the lead, but was still seen as being just short of the delegate total he needed to win.\n\n====Democratic convention====\nThe [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] was held in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]. In the week before the convention opened, Kennedy received two new challengers when Lyndon B. Johnson, the powerful [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] from Texas, and Adlai Stevenson, the party's nominee in 1952 and 1956, officially announced their candidacies (they had both privately been working for the nomination for some time). However, neither Johnson nor Stevenson was a match for the talented and highly efficient Kennedy campaign team led by [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Johnson challenged Kennedy to a televised debate before a joint meeting of the Texas and Massachusetts delegations, to which Kennedy accepted. Most observers believed that Kennedy won the debate, and Johnson was unable to expand his delegate support beyond the South. Stevenson's failure to launch his candidacy publicly until the week of the convention meant that many liberal delegates who might have supported him were already pledged to Kennedy, and Stevenson\u2014despite the energetic support of former First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]\u2014could not break their allegiance. Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot.\n\nThen, in a move that surprised many, Kennedy asked Johnson to be his running mate. He realized that he could not be elected without the support of traditional [[Southern Democrats]], most of whom had backed Johnson. He offered Johnson the vice presidential nomination at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel]] at 10:15&nbsp;a.m. on July 14, 1960, the morning after being nominated for president.<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135.

[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], and [[Seymour Hersh]] quoted Robert Kennedy's version of events, writing that John Kennedy \"would have preferred [[Stuart Symington]] as his [[running-mate]]\" and that Johnson teamed with [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]] to \"pressure Kennedy to offer the nomination\". Hersh goes on to present an alternative version of events; he writes that Kennedy was essentially blackmailed into offering the vice presidency to Johnson. The same story was originally presented by [[Anthony Summers]] in his biography of FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. [[Evelyn Lincoln]], Kennedy's personal secretary, told Summers in an interview that she was convinced in mid-1960 that J. Edgar Hoover and Johnson had conspired. Hoover was known to keep detailed files on the personal lives of many political figures and Kennedy was no exception. Hoover obtained information about Jack's womanizing prior to the election from at least two different sources. In January 1942, while Jack was serving in the [[United States Navy]], FBI surveillance records confirmed that he was having an affair with a woman named [[Inga Arvad]]; then, in 1958, a couple named Leonard and Florence Kater found out that their tenant, [[Pamela Turnure]], a secretary in Kennedy's Senate office, had been having an affair with the soon-to-be president. The Katers rigged up a tape recorder to pick up the sounds of the couple's lovemaking and snapped a picture of Kennedy himself. The Katers sent this information to the newspapers and one company - Stearn Publications - passed it along to Hoover. Soon after, \"he quietly obtained a copy of the compromising sex tapes and offered them to Lyndon Johnson as campaign ammunition.\" Lincoln said that Johnson \"had been using all the information Hoover could find on Kennedy - during the campaign, even before the Convention. And Hoover was in on the pressure on Kennedy at the Convention.\" A few days after the offer was made, [[Pierre Salinger]], the campaign's press secretary, had asked Jack Kennedy whether he really expected Johnson to accept the offer or if he was merely making a polite gesture. Kennedy responded cryptically: \"The whole story will never be known. And it's just as well that it won't be.\" \"The only people who were involved in the discussions were Jack and myself,\" said Robert Kennedy. \"We both promised each other that we'd never tell what happened.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J.

Hersh]], ''The Dark Side of Camelot'', 1997, Chapter 12</ref>\n\nBiographers [[Robert Caro]] and [[W. Marvin Watson]] offer a different perspective; they write that the Kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast to be a very close race against [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]]. Johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry votes from Texas and the [[Southern United States]]. Caro's research showed that on July 14, Kennedy started the process while Johnson was still asleep. At 6:30&nbsp;a.m., Kennedy asked his brother to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes, \"including Texas.\"<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> Robert Kennedy called [[Pierre Salinger]] and [[Kenneth O'Donnell]] to assist him. Realizing the ramifications of counting Texas votes as their own, Salinger asked him whether he was considering a Kennedy-Johnson ticket, and Robert replied, \"yes\".<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> Between 9 and 10 a.m., John Kennedy called Pennsylvania governor [[David L. Lawrence]], a Johnson backer, to request that Lawrence nominate Johnson for vice president if Johnson were to accept the role and then went to Johnson's suite to discuss a mutual ticket at 10:15&nbsp;a.m. John Kennedy then returned to his suite to announce the Kennedy-Johnson ticket to his closest supporters and Northern political bosses. He accepted the congratulations of [[List of governors of Ohio|Ohio Governor]] [[Michael DiSalle]], [[List of governors of Connecticut|Connecticut Governor]] [[Abraham A. Ribicoff]], [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]], and [[Mayor of New York City|New York City mayor]] [[Robert F. Wagner Jr.]]. Lawrence said that \"Johnson has the strength where you need it most\"; he then left to begin writing the nomination speech.<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> O'Donnell remembers being angry at what he considered a betrayal by John Kennedy, who had previously cast Johnson as anti-labor and anti-liberal. Afterward, Robert Kennedy visited with labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of Johnson and after seeing the depth of labor opposition to Johnson, he ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and Johnson, apparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without John Kennedy's authorization and to get Johnson to agree to be the Democratic Party chairman rather than vice president. Johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from John Kennedy. Despite his brother's interference, John Kennedy was firm that Johnson was who he wanted as running mate and met with staffers such as [[Larry O'Brien]], his national campaign manager, to say Johnson was to be vice president. O'Brien recalled later that John Kennedy's words were wholly unexpected, but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation, he thought \"it was a stroke of genius\".<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135.

Eisenhower could not run for the office of president again; he had been elected in 1952 and 1956.\n\nIn 1959, it looked as if Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] might face a serious challenge for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination from New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the leader of the Republican moderate-liberal wing. However, Rockefeller announced that he would not be a candidate for president after a national tour revealed that the great majority of Republicans favored Nixon.<ref>(White, pp. 91\u201392)</ref>\n\nAfter Rockefeller's withdrawal, Nixon faced no significant opposition for the Republican nomination. At the [[1960 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], Nixon was the overwhelming choice of the delegates, with conservative Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] from Arizona receiving 10 votes from conservative delegates. In earning the nomination, Nixon became the first sitting vice president to run for president since [[John C. Breckinridge]] exactly a century prior. Nixon then chose former Massachusetts Senator and [[United Nations]] Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], as his vice presidential running mate. Nixon chose Lodge because his foreign-policy credentials fit into Nixon's strategy to campaign more on foreign policy than domestic policy, which he believed favored the Democrats. Nixon had previously sought Rockefeller as his running mate, but the governor had no ambitions to be vice president. However, he later served as [[Gerald Ford]]'s vice president from 1974 to 1977.<ref>(White, pp. 242\u2013243)</ref>\n\n==General election==\n\n===Campaign promises===\n[[File:Dwight David Eisenhower, photo portrait by Bachrach, 1952.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the incumbent president in 1960, whose term expired on January 20, 1961]]\nDuring the campaign, Kennedy charged that under Eisenhower and the Republicans the nation had fallen behind the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]], both militarily and economically, and that as president he would \"get America moving again.\" The Eisenhower administration had established NASA in 1958, but Kennedy believed that the Republican Party had ignored the need to catch up to the Soviet Union in the Space Race. He promised that the new Democratic administration would fully appreciate the importance of space accomplishments for the national security and international prestige of the United States. Nixon responded that, if elected, he would continue the \"peace and prosperity\" that Eisenhower had brought the nation in the 1950s.  Nixon also argued that with the nation engaged in the Cold War with the Soviets, that Kennedy was too young and inexperienced to be trusted with the presidency. Had Nixon been elected, at 48 years, 11 days, he would have been [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|the fourth-youngest]] president at the date of inauguration. Kennedy, by contrast, was 43 years, 236 days, on the date of his inauguration; the second-youngest man to begin a Presidency (at 42 [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who [[First inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt|assumed the Presidency]] upon the [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassination of United States President William McKinley]] 60 years previously, was the youngest).\n\nDuring Kennedy's campaign he relied on his youth and promised to bring about change. Kennedy had a slogan emphasizing his youth reading, \"who's seasoned through and through/but not so dog-gone seasoned that he won't try something new.\" He was also endorsed by celebrities such as [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Harry Belafonte]]. Nixon relied on his experience in politics. He emphasized to the American voters that he was more qualified to hold the office of president. He wanted voters to know that he had the abilities to take on Communist threats.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Byung Joon|date=September 2016|title=Attacking the Airwaves: How Television Changed the American Presidential Campaign|url=|journal=The New England Journal of History|volume=73|pages=1\u201327}}</ref>\n\n===Campaign events===\n[[File:John F.

However, Nixon was plagued by bad luck throughout the fall campaign. In August, President Eisenhower, who had long been ambivalent about Nixon, held a televised press conference in which a reporter, Charles Mohr of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', mentioned Nixon's claims that he had been a valuable administration insider and adviser. Mohr asked Eisenhower if he could give an example of a major idea of Nixon's that he had heeded. Eisenhower responded with the flip comment, \"If you give me a week, I might think of one.\"<ref>Ambrose, Stephen E. (1991). ''Eisenhower: Soldier and President'', p. 525. Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-74758-4}}.</ref> Although both Eisenhower and Nixon later claimed that he was merely joking with the reporter, the remark hurt Nixon, as it undercut his claims of having greater decision-making experience than Kennedy. The remark proved so damaging to Nixon that the Democrats turned Eisenhower's statement into a television commercial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nixon's Experience?

This pledge backfired when, in August, Nixon injured his knee on a car door while campaigning in [[North Carolina]]. The knee became infected and Nixon had to cease campaigning for two weeks while the infection was treated with [[Antibacterial|antibiotics]]. When he left [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]], Nixon refused to abandon his pledge to visit every state; he thus wound up wasting valuable time visiting states that he had no chance of winning, or that had few electoral votes and would be of little help at the election, or states that he would almost certainly win regardless. For example, in his effort to visit all 50 states, Nixon spent the vital weekend before the election campaigning in Alaska, which had only three electoral votes, while Kennedy campaigned in more populous states, such as New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.\n\nNixon visited Atlanta, Georgia on August 26 and acquired a very large turnout to his event. Nixon rode through a parade in Atlanta and was greeted by 150,000 people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=The Nixon-Kennedy Campaigns In Georgia|last=Fleming|first=K|date=November 1960|work=The Atlanta-Journal and Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> Nixon mentioned in his speech in Atlanta, \"in the last quarter of a century there hasn't been a Democratic candidate for President that has bothered to campaign in the State of Georgia.\"<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25759|title=John F.

Kennedy would change that statistic and visit some surprising states, including Georgia. Senator Kennedy visited the cities of Columbus, Warm Springs, and Lagrange on his campaign trail in Georgia. In his visit to Warm Springs, state troopers tried to keep Kennedy from an immense crowd, however Kennedy reached out to shake hands of those who were sick with polio.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Cheering Throng Engulfs Kennedy|last=Galphin|first=B|date=October 11, 1960|work=The Atlanta-Journal Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> He also visited small towns across Georgia on his trip and saw a mass of 100,000 people during the entire visit. Kennedy spoke at a rehabilitation facility in Warm Springs. Warm Springs was near and dear to Kennedy's heart due to the effects the facility had on [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt spent time at the rehabilitation facility and died there in 1945.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\"/>\n\nIn Warm Springs, Kennedy spoke to supporters at the facility and mentioned Franklin D. Roosevelt in his speech. He admired Roosevelt and commended him for sticking up for the farmers, workers, small towns, big cities, those in poverty, and those who were sick.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\" /> He said Roosevelt had a \"spirit of strength and progress to get America moving.\"<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\" /> Kennedy discussed his six-point plan for healthcare. He wanted a medical program set up for retirement and federal funding for the construction of medical schools and hospitals. He also planned for the government to loan students money to attend medical school and provide grants to renovate old hospitals. He called for more money to be spent on medical research and finally, expand effort for rehabilitation and come up with new ways to assist those in need.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\" /> Many Republicans disapproved Kennedy's plans and described them as an \"appeal to socialism\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Kennedy's Plans Altered: Crowd of 50,000 Is Seen|last=Gaines|first=Marion|date=October 6, 1960|work=The Atlanta-Journal Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> People around Warm Springs were supportive of Kennedy.

Johnson vigorously campaigned for Kennedy and was instrumental in helping the Democrats to carry several Southern states skeptical of him, especially Johnson's home state of Texas. Johnson made a \"last-minute change of plans and scheduled two 12-minute whistlestop speeches in Georgia\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Johnson Due in State Tonight|last=|first=|date=October 11, 1960|work=The Atlanta Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> One of these visits included stopping in Atlanta to speak from the rear of a train at Terminal Station.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=|title=New President Johnson An Old Friend to Georgia|last=|first=|date=November 23, 1963|work=The Atlanta Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> On the other hand, Ambassador Lodge, Nixon's running mate, ran a lethargic campaign and made several mistakes that hurt Nixon. Among them was a pledge\u2014not approved by Nixon\u2014that as President, Nixon would name a black person to his cabinet.

Nixon insisted on campaigning until just a few hours before the first debate started. He had not completely recovered from his stay in hospital and thus looked pale, sickly, underweight, and tired.<ref name=\"Nixon, p. 270\">(Nixon, p. 270)</ref> His eyes moved across the room during the debate, and at various moments sweat was visible on his face. He also refused make-up for the first debate, and as a result his facial stubble showed prominently on the black-and-white TV screens at the time. Furthermore, the debate set appeared darker once the paint dried up, causing Nixon's suit color to blend in with the background which reduced his stature.<ref name=\"Nixon, p. 270\"/> Nixon's poor appearance on television in the first debate is reflected by the fact that his mother called him immediately following the debate to ask if he was sick.<ref>(Nixon, p. 271)</ref>{{efn|name=\"addisons\"|His tanned appearance was likely darkening ([[hyperpigmentation]]) of the skin due to [[Addison's disease#Notable cases|Addison's disease]].

Contrary to popular belief, the Sindlinger evidence suggests not that Kennedy won on television but that the candidates tied on television while Nixon won on radio.

Nixon was in Los Angeles while Kennedy was in New York. The men appear to be in the same room, thanks to identical sets. Both candidates had monitors in their respective studios containing the feed from the opposite studio so they could respond to questions.

More to the point, Illinois was the site of the most extensive challenge process, which fell short despite repeated efforts spearheaded by Cook County state's attorney, Benjamin Adamowski, a Republican, who also lost his re-election bid. Despite demonstrating net errors favoring both Nixon and Adamowski (some precincts\u201440% in Nixon's case\u2014showed errors favoring them, a factor suggesting error, rather than fraud), the totals found fell short of reversing the results for either candidate.

Instead of having the voters choose from slates of electors, the Alabama ballot had voters choose the [[US Presidential Electors|electors]] individually. Traditionally, in such a situation, a given candidate is assigned the popular vote of the elector who received the most votes. For instance, candidates pledged to Nixon received anywhere from 230,951 votes (for George Witcher) to 237,981 votes (for Cecil Durham); Nixon is therefore assigned 237,981 popular votes from Alabama.\n\nThe situation was more complicated on the Democratic side. The statewide Democratic primary had chosen eleven candidates for the Electoral College, five of whom were pledged to vote for Kennedy, and six of whom were free to vote for anyone they chose. All of these candidates won in the general election, and all six unpledged electors voted against Kennedy. The actual number of popular votes received by Kennedy is therefore difficult to allocate. Traditionally, Kennedy is assigned either 318,303 votes (the votes won by the most popular Kennedy elector) or 324,050 votes (the votes won by the most popular unpledged Democratic elector); the results table below is based on Kennedy winning 318,303 votes in Alabama.<ref name=\"trende\">{{cite news| title = Did JFK Lose the Popular Vote?| publisher = RealClearPolitics| date = October 22, 2012| url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/10/19/did_jfk_lose_the_popular_vote_115833.html| accessdate = October 23, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=====Georgia=====\nThe actual number of popular votes received by Kennedy and Nixon in Georgia is also difficult to determine because voters voted for 12 separate electors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Novotny|first1=Patrick|title=John F.

Garfield]] in 1880 to not carry California; since then, [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976, [[George W. Bush]] in 2000 and 2004, and [[Donald Trump]] in 2016, won the White House despite losing California.\n* This was the first election that Arizona participated in which it did not back the winning candidate.\n* Kennedy was the first Democrat to win the presidency without carrying Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma and Virginia, the last to win without Ohio and Wisconsin, and the first to win without Tennessee and Kentucky since 1852.\n* Kennedy is the last candidate from either party elected without carrying Ohio, and only [[Bill Clinton]] in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] has won without Florida since.\n* Since [[1840 United States presidential election|1840]], this is the second and most recent presidential election in which [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] have had a different popular vote victor. (Mississippi was also unable to vote in [[1868 United States presidential election|1868]] due to [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]). However, the majority of Alabama's electoral votes went to [[Harry F. Byrd]] instead of John F. Kennedy. All of Mississippi's electoral votes went to Byrd.\n* This election marked the first time since [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] that the Democratic candidate's share of the popular vote went up as opposed to down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/popular-vote/|title=Popular Votes 1940-2012 - Roper Center|publisher=}}</ref>\n* This was the first election where both major party candidates were born in the 20th century.\n* It marked the first election of two incumbent U.S. senators as president and vice president, a phenomenon that was repeated by [[Barack Obama]] and [[Joe Biden]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]]. In both instances, the President-elect was the younger of the two and also the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior senator]] from his state.\n* Kennedy was both the last Northern Democrat and sitting United States senator to win either the presidency or popular vote until the election of Barack Obama in 2008.\n* This was the first presidential election since [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]] that the incumbent Vice President was a presidential nominee.\n* Barry Goldwater was the only person to come in fourth for either President or vice president in the electoral college during the 20th century, and the first since 1872.\n* As of the 2016 Presidential Election this is the last time that Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee did not all vote for the same candidate.\n* This was the only presidential election where both major candidates were less than fifty years of age.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of the United States (1945\u20131964)]]\n* [[Inauguration of John F.
