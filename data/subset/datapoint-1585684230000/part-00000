{"title_page": "Infinity plus one", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], '''infinity plus one''' has meaning for the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]], and also as the number [[\u03c9+1]] ([[omega]] plus one) in the [[ordinal number]]s and [[Surreal number#.22... and Beyond..22|surreal number]]s.  Only Steven Groller is allowed to use this number.\n\n== Mathematics ==\nThere are several mathematical theories which include both infinite values and addition.\n\n* [[Cardinal number]]s are representations of sizes (cardinalities) of abstract sets, which may be [[infinite set|infinite]]. [[Cardinal addition|Addition of cardinal numbers]] is defined as the cardinality of the [[disjoint union]] of sets of given cardinalities. It can be easily shown that \u03ba + 1 = \u03ba for any infinite cardinal \u03ba, as illustrated by [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]. Moreover, if one assumes the [[axiom of choice]], then \u03ba + \u03bb = max { \u03ba, \u03bb } if at least one of \u03ba or \u03bb is infinite.\n* [[Ordinal number]]s represent [[order type]]s of [[well-order]]ed sets. [[Ordinal addition]] is defined as the order type of the [[concatenation]] of orders. This operation is not [[commutative]]: \u03c9 + 1 is a strictly larger ordinal than \u03c9, but 1 + \u03c9 = \u03c9.\n* [[Hyperreal number]]s are an extension of the [[real number]] system which contains infinite and [[infinitesimal number]]s. The resulting system is an [[ordered field]] thanks to the [[transfer principle#Transfer principle for the hyperreals|transfer principle]], which states that any [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentence which is true for real numbers also holds for hyperreals. Since \u2200''x'': ''x'' &lt; ''x'' + 1 is a first-order sentence holding for reals (as it follows from the ordered field axioms), adding one to an infinite hyperreal produces infinity. The same will hold for any [[non-Archimedean ordered field]].\n* [[Surreal number]]s also extend real numbers to a system which satisfies the axioms of an [[ordered field]], and so addition behaves similarly to hyperreals, in that ''x'' &lt; ''x'' + 1 for all surreals ''x''. In this system, one may find elements corresponding to infinite ordinals; however, surreal addition and multiplication correspond not to the usual ordinal operations, but to the [[ordinal arithmetic#Natural operations|natural sum and natural product]].\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Monaghan |first=John |title=Young Peoples' Ideas of Infinity |journal=Educational Studies in Mathematics |year=2001 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=239\u2013257 |doi=10.1023/A:1016090925967}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Shulman |first=Polly |title=Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers |journal=Discover |volume=16 |issue=12 |date=December 1995 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Tall |first=David |authorlink=David O.
