There is however general consensus among Austronesianists that Enggano belongs to the Austronesian language family.{{sfnp|Lafeber|1922}}<ref>Nothofer 1986.</ref><ref>Blust, R. A. (2013).

'Local Languages in the PAN Area'. In Reiner Carle et al. ed., ''Gava\u2018: Studies in Austronesian languages and cultures dedicated to Hans K\u00e4hler'', trans. Geoffrey Sutton, 1-15, p. 4.</ref><ref name=Blench>Blench, Roger. 2014. The Enggano: archaic foragers and their interactions with the Austronesian world. m.s.</ref>\n\nWhen first contacted by Europeans, the [[Enggano people]] had more cultural commonalities with indigenous peoples of the [[Nicobar Islands]] than those of with Austronesian Sumatra. For instance, beehive houses were typical of both Enggano Island and the Nicobar Islands. However, there are no apparent linguistic connections with [[Nicobarese language|Nicobarese]] or other [[Austroasiatic languages]].\n\n==Classification==\nThe classification of Enggano is controversial,{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=54\u201355}} ranging from proposals that negate its inclusion in the Austronesian family all the way to classifications that place Enggano in the [[Northwest Sumatra\u2013Barrier Islands languages|Northwest Sumatra\u2013Barrier Islands]] subgroup together with other [[Austronesian languages]] of the area (e.g. [[Nias language|Nias]]). \n\nBased on the low number of apparent Austronesian cognates, Capell (1982) concludes that Enggano is a [[language isolate]] rather than Austronesian as previously assumed.<ref name=Capell/> Blench (2014)<ref name=Blench/> considers Enggano to be a [[language isolate]] that has picked up Austronesian loanwords, and notes many basic vocabulary items in Enggano are of non-Austronesian origin. Based on lexical evidence from the Enggano language, he considers the Enggano people to be descendants of [[Pleistocene]] (pre-Neolithic) [[hunter-gatherer]]s that had preceded the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesians]].\n\nEdwards (2015) demonstrates that pronouns, numerals and many affixes in Enggano can be directly derived from [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language|Proto-Malayo-Polynesian]].{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=70\u201379}} Based on this evidence, together with regular sound changes from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian to Enggano, Edwards concludes that Enggano clearly belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the Austronesian languages. Within Malayo-Polynesian, he considers Enggano to be a primary branch.{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|p=93}}\n\nEdwards thus rejects Capell's and Blench's proposal that Enggano is a non-Austronesian language with Austronesian loanwords, and considers it to be clearly Austronesian. While a large portion of its lexicon obviously cannot be derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, it remains unclear whether this represents a non-Austronesian [[substratum]] from an unknown source language, or the result of internal lexical replacement.{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=91\u201392}}. He notes that Enggano possesses many aberrant phonological features (such as a small phonological inventory) and a low lexical retention rate, which is more typical of Austronesian languages spoken in eastern Indonesia and Melanesia than rather than those of western Indonesia. Enggano's lexical retention rate (i.e., percentage of lexical items that are cognate with reconstructed [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] forms) is only 21% (46 out of 217 words), while the lexical retention rate for [[Malay language|Malay]] is 59% (132.5 out of 223 words).{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|p=76}} Some non-Austronesian languages in Southeast Asia, such as [[Nancowry language|Nancowry]], [[Semelai language|Semelai]], and [[Abui language|Abui]] also have low lexical retention rates.{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|p=76}}\n\n==Evolution==\nEnggano has historically undergone [[nasal harmony]] in its identifiable Austronesian vocabulary, where all [[stop consonant|stop consonants]] and vowels in a word became nasal after a nasal vowel, and oral after an oral vowel, so that there is no longer a phonemic distinction between them. For example, *e\u0169\u2019ada\u2019a became ''e\u0169\u2019\u00e3n\u00e3\u2019\u00e3'', while nasal consonants are no longer found in ''\u2019ub'' 'house' or ''\u2019a-rib'' 'five' (cf. Malay ''rumah, lima'').\n\nEnggano is the only western Austronesian language in which *t shifted to {{IPA|/k/}}, an unusual change that occurred independently several times in [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] after *k shifted to [[glottal stop]].{{sfnp|Blust|2004|p=383}}\n\n== Phonology ==\nThe only major linguistic treatment of Enggano was conducted by Hans K\u00e4hler in 1937; he published a grammar (1940), texts, and a dictionary (1987). However, phonology is limited to a simple inventory and a short paragraph of basic features; the grammar and dictionary disagree with each other, the dictionary is not consistent, some words are not legible, and doubts have been raised about the accuracy of the transcriptions. Nothofer (1992) discusses loanwords and also lists phonemes.<ref name=\"Nothofer\">Nothofer, 1986, p. 97, after K\u00e4hler (1940).</ref> Yoder (2011) is a thesis on Enggano vowels, with some comments on consonants; it will be followed here.<ref>[http://www.und.edu/dept/linguistics/theses/2011Yoder.PDF Yoder, 2011.]</ref>\n\nStress was once reported to be penultimate but appears to occur on the final syllable. Alternating syllables preceding it have secondary stress.\n\nYoder and Nothofer report seven oral and seven nasal vowels:<ref>K\u00e4hler's dictionary is similar, but lacks {{IPA|/\u0268 \u0268\u0303/}}.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\" \n|- align=\"center\" \n!\n! front\n! central\n! back\n|- align=\"center\"\n! close\n| i \u0129\n| \u0268 \u0268\u0303\n| u \u0169\n|- align=\"center\"\n! mid\n| e \u1ebd\n| \u0258 \u0258\u0303\n| o \u00f5\n|- align=\"center\"\n! open\n| colspan=2| a \u00e3 \n|  \n|}\nDiphthongs are {{IPA|/ai, a\u0268, au, ei, \u0258i, oi/}}.\n\nVowels do not occur word-initially in Enggano apart from what Yoder analyzes as {{IPA|/i u/}} before another vowel; these are then pronounced as semivowels {{IPA|[j w]}}. (Nothofer counts these as consonants {{IPA|/j, w/}} restricted to initial position, which avoids the problem of not uncommon {{IPA|[ji]}} being analyzed as {{IPA|/ii/}}, when sequences of the same vowel are  otherwise quite rare.) The vowels {{IPA|/i \u0268 u e o/}} are all pronounced as semivowels in vowel sequences after medial glottal consonants {{IPA|/\u0294 h/}}, as in {{IPA|/k\u00f5\u0294\u0129\u00e3/ [k\u00f5\u0294j\u00e3]}} (a sp. tree) and {{IPA|/bohoe/ [boho\u032fe]}} 'wild'; otherwise, apart from diphthongs, vowel sequences are disyllabic, as in {{IPA|/\u0294a-piah/ [\u0294api.ah]}} 'to graze'. {{IPA|/i/}} optionally triggers a glide after a following glottal consonant, as in {{IPA|/ki-\u0294u/ [ki\u0294u ~ ki\u0294ju]}} 'to say'. Diphthongs lower to {{IPA|[a\u026a, a\u028a]}} etc. before a coda stop, as in {{IPA|/kipa\u0294\u00e3\u0169p/ [k\u0129p\u00e3\u0294\u00e3\u028a\u0303p]}} 'ten', and undergo metathesis when that stop is glottal, as in {{IPA|/kahai\u0294 kak/ [kaha\u0294\u026akak]}} 'twenty'. An [[intrusive vowel]] {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306]}} appears between glottal stop and another consonant (though not semivowels), as in {{IPA|/ka\u0294h\u0268\u0258/ [ka\u0294.\u0259\u0306.h\u0268.\u0258]}} 'female leader'; this does not affect the pattern of stress.\n\nIn many words, a final vowel transcribed by K\u00e4hler is not found in Yoder.\n\nThe offglide of diphthongs lowers before glottal consonants, and a glottal stop may intrude when another word follows, as in {{IPA|/kahai\u0294 m\u0258h/}} {{IPA|[kaha\u0294\u026am\u0258\u0303h]}} 'another'.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! \n!

Approximant\n| \n| (l) \n| j ?\n| w ?\n|  \n|}\nYoder notes that the voiced stops {{IPA|[b~m, d~n]}} are in [[complementary distribution]], depending on whether the word has nasal vowels, but lists them separately. Voiced oral consonants, {{IPA|[b d l r]}}, do not occur in words with nasal consonants or vowels. Nasal consonants nasalize all vowels in a word, and there is therefore no contrast between {{IPA|[m n]}} and {{IPA|[b d]}} apart from the contrast between nasal and oral vowels. For example, with the oral stem ''tax'' 'bag', the possessive forms are ''tahi\u2019'' 'my bag' and ''tahib'' 'your bag', but with the nasal stem 'age', the forms are ''\u2019umunu\u2019'' 'my age' and ''\u2019umunum'' 'your age'.\n\n{{IPA|/l/}} occurs in only a few native words. {{IPA|/s ~ x/}} are infrequent and apparently a single phoneme; they only occur word finally, where they contrast with {{IPA|/h/}}: {{IPA|[x]}} occurs after the non-front vowels {{IPA|/\u0268 \u0259 u/}}, {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} after the front vowels {{IPA|/i a \u00e3/}}, and {{IPA|[s]}} after vowel sequences ending in {{IPA|/i/}} (including {{IPA|/ii, ui/}}). The resulting {{IPA|[a\u00e7 \u00e3\u00e7]}} may actually be {{IPA|/aix \u00e3\u0129x/}}, as most such words are attested with alternation like {{IPA|[ka\u00e7 ~ kais]}} 'box'. When a suffix is added, so that this consonant is no longer word-final, it becomes {{IPA|/h/}}, as in ''tahi\u2019'' 'my bag' above.\n\nNothofer is similar, but does not list the uncommon consonants {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/s ~ x/}} and counts {{IPA|[j w]}} as consonants rather than allophones of vowels. K\u00e4hler's dictionary adds {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, as well as {{IPA|/f t\u0283 d\u0292/}} as marginal phonemes, and claims that {{IPA|/t r/}} are only found in southern villages. However, Yoder states that at the time of his research in 2010 there were no differences among the six villages on Enggano Island, and that initial {{IPA|/t r/}} and final {{IPA|/t d/}} are rare in native words. Medial {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} are in free variation in a few words, with older people preferring {{IPA|/d/}} and younger speakers {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n==Grammar==\nThe main reference on the syntax and morphology of the Enggano language is the grammar produced by the German scholar Hans K\u00e4hler, which was published in 1940.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940}} There are also some references to syntax and morphology in more recent work, such as Yoder (2011) and Edwards (2015). This section compares some of the findings in K\u00e4hler (1940) with those of Yoder (2011), where the language appears to have undergone some changes.\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nThe pronouns listed in K\u00e4hler (1940) are as follows:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=106}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There is also a phonological process whereby a vowel is inserted between the [[glottal stop]] and the u in the 1sg enclitic ''-'u''. This is the final vowel of the stem to which the suffix attaches, e.g. ''euba'' 'house' > ''euba'au'' 'my house', ''ebohe'' 'spear' > ''ebohe'eu'' 'my {{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=96}} Possession can also be indicated using the proclitic pronouns above.\n\nThe pronouns listed in Yoder (2011) are as follows:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Enggano pronouns\n|-\n! Pronoun !! Independent !! Suffix\n|-\n| 1sg ||\u2019u || -\u2019\n|-\n| we.{{sc|EXCL}} ||\u2019a ||\n|-\n| we.{{sc|INCL}} ||\u2019ik || -k\n|-\n| 2sg ||\u2019\u0259\u2019 || -b ~ -m\n|-\n| 2pl ||\u2019ari || -du ~ -nu\n|-\n| 3sg ||ki || rowspan=2| -d(e) ~ -n(e)\n|-\n| 3pl ||ham\u0259\u2019 \n|-\n| this ||(p\u1ebd)\u2019\u1ebd\u2019\n|-\n| that ||\u2019\u1ebd\u00f5\u2019\n|-\n| who ||h\u00e3\n|-\n| what ||\u2019i.ah\n|}\nMost of these appear to be Austronesian: Compare Malay 1sg ''aku ~ ku'', 1.{{sc|ex}} ''kami'', 1.{{sc|in}} ''kita'', 2pl ''kalian'', 3sg/pl ''dia'', and suffixes 1sg ''-ku'', 2sg ''-mu'', 3sg ''-nya'', with *k, *t (d), *l, *m, *n having shifted to ''\u2019, k, r, b, d'' in Enggano, and with final consonants and (where possible) vowels being lost. The possessive suffixes appear on nouns, and they are often preceded by a vowel. Few forms are attested, but this vowel is ''i'' or ''ai'' after {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} (as with 'bag' in the phonology section), an [[echo vowel]] after several other consonants, and with several words not predictable on current evidence: ''\u2019eam \u2013 \u2019ami\u2019'' '(my) fishing rod'.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nNouns in Enggano can be subcategorised into three different classes: humans, proper nouns and common nouns. They take different articles to indicate singular and plural reference:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=85}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Articles in Enggano\n!Noun Class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n|Human\n|e-\n|ka-\n|-\n|Proper\n|\u2205-\n|\u2205-\n|-\n|Common\n|e-\n|e-\n|}\nBlench notes that ''e-'' may be a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]<ref name=\"Blench\" /> and Edwards argues that the articles not only mark [[noun class]] but also [[Grammatical case|case]].{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=60\u201361}} Nouns marked with ''e-'' and the other articles above can express both subjects and objects. The prefix ''e-'' can also be used to derive [[Gerund|gerunds]] from verbal stems.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940}} Plural number can also be indicated through [[reduplication]].{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=87}} In this case, the meaning is exhaustive, e.g. all of the nouns.\n\nNouns with an oblique function, e.g. those expressing nominal possessors, subjects of gerunds and any noun that follows the [[Oblique argument|oblique]] marker ''i'ioo'', take the article ''u-'' in place of ''e-''. Finally, [[Locative case|locative nouns]] take the locative prefix ''i-''.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940}}\n\nNouns in Enggano can be modified by demonstratives and relative clauses. As in other Austronesian languages, these typically follow the nominal head. There are three demonstratives in Enggano:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=92}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Demonstratives in Enggano\n!Demonstrative\n!Enggano\n!Rough Translation\n|-\n|Proximal\n|ei'ie\n|this\n|-\n|Medial\n|e'ana\n|that\n|-\n|Distal\n|ea'a\n|that\n|}\nRelative clauses are introduced by a relativiser ''m\u00f5'\u00f5''. K\u00e4hler suggests that older speakers of Enggano would use different relativisers depending on whether the head noun was singular (''hem\u00f5\u2019\u00f5'') or plural (''h\u00f5m\u00f5\u2019\u00f5''). However, in 1937 when he was conducting research, this practice was already uncommon in everyday language.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=93}} An example of a relative clause in Enggano is given below. This shows that demonstratives also follow relative clauses:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=93}}\n<br />\n{|\n|(1)\n|ka'u'ua-da'a\n|e-uba\n|m\u00f5'\u00f5\n|'am\u0169h\u00f5\n|ei'ie\n|-\n|\n|beautiful-<small>PRED</small>\n|<small>ART</small>-house\n|<small>REL</small>\n|big\n|<small>PROX.DEM</small>\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"5\" |'This house which is big is beautiful'\n|}\n\nK\u00e4hler describes some processes of [[Morphological derivation|nominal derivation]] in Enggano. Specifically, he notes that instrumental nouns can be formed via the addition of a vowel or ''paV-'' to a verbal root, e.g. ''poko'' 'to chisel' > ''e-opoko'' 'a chisel' or ''kui'' 'to sew' > ''e-paukui'' 'needle'. Locative nouns are formed with an ''-a'' suffix, e.g. ''parudu'' 'gather' > ''e-parudu-a'' 'gathering place'.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|pp=316\u2013318}}\n\n=== Verbs and Adjectives ===\nAdjectives commonly have prefixes ''ka-, ka\u2019-, ki-''; the first two are attested in derivation, and the last is assumed as it is very common and many such adjectives otherwise appear to be reduplicated, as in ''kinanap'' 'smooth' (Yoder 2011).\n\nVerbs may have one or two prefixes and sometimes a suffix. Attested prefixes are ''ba-, ba\u2019-, ia-, iah-, ka-, ka\u2019-, kah-, ki-, kir-, ko-, pa-, pah-, \u2019a-.'' The functions of these are unknown. ''Ki-'' and ''pa-'' may occur together, as in ''pe, pape, kipe, kipape'', all glossed as 'give'. The three attested verbal suffixes are ''-i, -ar, -a\u2019'' (Yoder 2011).\n\n=== Numerals ===\nThe counting system is, or at least once was, [[vigesimal]]: K\u00e4hler recorded ''kahai'i ekaka'' 'one man' = 20, ''ariba ekaka'' 'five man' = 100, ''kahai'i edudodoka'' 'one our-body' = 400. (The last may be based on two people counting together: each time I count all twenty of my digits, you count one of yours, so that when you have counted all of your digits, the number is 20\u00d720 = 400.) However, most people now use Malay numerals when speaking Enggano, especially for higher numbers. Yoder (2011) recorded the following:<ref>Also found [https://web.archive.org/web/20101230153201/http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/numeral/Enggano.htm here]</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n! Numeral !!

Compare the remaining ''-hai\u2019, -ru, -k\u0259r, -up, -rib'' with [[Lampung language|Lampung]] ''\u0259say, rua, t\u0259lu, \u0259pat, lima''; *s, *t, *l, *m have shifted to ''h, k, r, b'' in Enggano, and final consonants and (simple) vowels have been lost. \n''\u2019aki\u2019akin'' 6 may be reduplication of ''\u2019ak\u0259r'' 3. ''\u2019arib he \u2019aru'' 7 is 'five and two'. The two forms for 8 mean 'hugging', from the verb ''p\u00e3\u2019\u0129\u00f5p'' 'to hug', and 9 appears to be 'eight, one coming'; it may be shortened to ''kaba kahai\u2019'' (no ''-i'') in enumeration. Yoder believes 10 may also be a verb, based on an unelicited root ''\u2019\u00e3\u0169p'', as ''ki-'' and ''pa-'' are verbal prefixes (as in ''ki-pa-pe'' 'to give'); indeed, the apparent prefixes on 1\u20135 are identical to verbal prefixes as well.\n\nNumbers above 10 and 20 are formed with ''he ~ hi'' 'and': ''k\u0129p\u00e3\u2019\u00e3\u0169p he \u2019aru'' 'ten and two' for 12, ''kahai\u2019 kak he k\u0129p\u00e3\u2019\u00e3\u0169p'' 'twenty and ten' for 30. ''kak'' is 'person', so twenty is 'one person'.

There is however general consensus among Austronesianists that Enggano belongs to the Austronesian language family.{{sfnp|Lafeber|1922}}<ref>Nothofer 1986.</ref><ref>Blust, R. A. (2013).

Geoffrey Sutton, 1-15, p. 4.</ref><ref name=Blench>Blench, Roger. 2014. The Enggano: archaic foragers and their interactions with the Austronesian world. m.s.</ref>\n\nWhen first contacted by Europeans, the [[Enggano people]] had more cultural commonalities with indigenous peoples of the [[Nicobar Islands]] than those of with Austronesian Sumatra. For instance, beehive houses were typical of both Enggano Island and the Nicobar Islands. However, there are no apparent linguistic connections with [[Nicobarese language|Nicobarese]] or other [[Austroasiatic languages]].\n\n==Classification==\nThe classification of Enggano is controversial,{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=54\u201355}} ranging from proposals that negate its inclusion in the Austronesian family all the way to classifications that place Enggano in the [[Northwest Sumatra\u2013Barrier Islands languages|Northwest Sumatra\u2013Barrier Islands]] subgroup together with other [[Austronesian languages]] of the area (e.g. [[Nias language|Nias]]). \n\nBased on the low number of apparent Austronesian cognates, Capell (1982) concludes that Enggano is a [[language isolate]] rather than Austronesian as previously assumed.<ref name=Capell/> Blench (2014)<ref name=Blench/> considers Enggano to be a [[language isolate]] that has picked up Austronesian loanwords, and notes many basic vocabulary items in Enggano are of non-Austronesian origin. Based on lexical evidence from the Enggano language, he considers the Enggano people to be descendants of [[Pleistocene]] (pre-Neolithic) [[hunter-gatherer]]s that had preceded the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesians]].\n\nEdwards (2015) demonstrates that pronouns, numerals and many affixes in Enggano can be directly derived from [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language|Proto-Malayo-Polynesian]].{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=70\u201379}} Based on this evidence, together with regular sound changes from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian to Enggano, Edwards concludes that Enggano clearly belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the Austronesian languages. Within Malayo-Polynesian, he considers Enggano to be a primary branch.{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|p=93}}\n\nEdwards thus rejects Capell's and Blench's proposal that Enggano is a non-Austronesian language with Austronesian loanwords, and considers it to be clearly Austronesian. While a large portion of its lexicon obviously cannot be derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, it remains unclear whether this represents a non-Austronesian [[substratum]] from an unknown source language, or the result of internal lexical replacement.{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=91\u201392}}. He notes that Enggano possesses many aberrant phonological features (such as a small phonological inventory) and a low lexical retention rate, which is more typical of Austronesian languages spoken in eastern Indonesia and Melanesia than rather than those of western Indonesia. Enggano's lexical retention rate (i.e., percentage of lexical items that are cognate with reconstructed [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] forms) is only 21% (46 out of 217 words), while the lexical retention rate for [[Malay language|Malay]] is 59% (132.5 out of 223 words).{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|p=76}} Some non-Austronesian languages in Southeast Asia, such as [[Nancowry language|Nancowry]], [[Semelai language|Semelai]], and [[Abui language|Abui]] also have low lexical retention rates.{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|p=76}}\n\n==Evolution==\nEnggano has historically undergone [[nasal harmony]] in its identifiable Austronesian vocabulary, where all [[stop consonant|stop consonants]] and vowels in a word became nasal after a nasal vowel, and oral after an oral vowel, so that there is no longer a phonemic distinction between them. For example, *e\u0169\u2019ada\u2019a became ''e\u0169\u2019\u00e3n\u00e3\u2019\u00e3'', while nasal consonants are no longer found in ''\u2019ub'' 'house' or ''\u2019a-rib'' 'five' (cf. Malay ''rumah, lima''). Enggano is the only western Austronesian language in which *t shifted to {{IPA|/k/}}, an unusual change that occurred independently several times in [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] after *k shifted to [[glottal stop]].{{sfnp|Blust|2004|p=383}}\n\n== Phonology ==\nThe only major linguistic treatment of Enggano was conducted by Hans K\u00e4hler in 1937; he published a grammar (1940), texts, and a dictionary (1987). However, phonology is limited to a simple inventory and a short paragraph of basic features; the grammar and dictionary disagree with each other, the dictionary is not consistent, some words are not legible, and doubts have been raised about the accuracy of the transcriptions. Nothofer (1992) discusses loanwords and also lists phonemes.<ref name=\"Nothofer\">Nothofer, 1986, p. 97, after K\u00e4hler (1940).</ref> Yoder (2011) is a thesis on Enggano vowels, with some comments on consonants; it will be followed here.<ref>[http://www.und.edu/dept/linguistics/theses/2011Yoder.PDF Yoder, 2011.]</ref>\n\nStress was once reported to be penultimate but appears to occur on the final syllable. Alternating syllables preceding it have secondary stress.\n\nYoder and Nothofer report seven oral and seven nasal vowels:<ref>K\u00e4hler's dictionary is similar, but lacks {{IPA|/\u0268 \u0268\u0303/}}.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\" \n|- align=\"center\" \n!\n! front\n! central\n! back\n|- align=\"center\"\n! close\n| i \u0129\n| \u0268 \u0268\u0303\n| u \u0169\n|- align=\"center\"\n! mid\n| e \u1ebd\n| \u0258 \u0258\u0303\n| o \u00f5\n|- align=\"center\"\n! open\n| colspan=2| a \u00e3 \n|  \n|}\nDiphthongs are {{IPA|/ai, a\u0268, au, ei, \u0258i, oi/}}.\n\nVowels do not occur word-initially in Enggano apart from what Yoder analyzes as {{IPA|/i u/}} before another vowel; these are then pronounced as semivowels {{IPA|[j w]}}. (Nothofer counts these as consonants {{IPA|/j, w/}} restricted to initial position, which avoids the problem of not uncommon {{IPA|[ji]}} being analyzed as {{IPA|/ii/}}, when sequences of the same vowel are  otherwise quite rare.) The vowels {{IPA|/i \u0268 u e o/}} are all pronounced as semivowels in vowel sequences after medial glottal consonants {{IPA|/\u0294 h/}}, as in {{IPA|/k\u00f5\u0294\u0129\u00e3/ [k\u00f5\u0294j\u00e3]}} (a sp. tree) and {{IPA|/bohoe/ [boho\u032fe]}} 'wild'; otherwise, apart from diphthongs, vowel sequences are disyllabic, as in {{IPA|/\u0294a-piah/ [\u0294api.ah]}} 'to graze'. {{IPA|/i/}} optionally triggers a glide after a following glottal consonant, as in {{IPA|/ki-\u0294u/ [ki\u0294u ~ ki\u0294ju]}} 'to say'. Diphthongs lower to {{IPA|[a\u026a, a\u028a]}} etc. before a coda stop, as in {{IPA|/kipa\u0294\u00e3\u0169p/ [k\u0129p\u00e3\u0294\u00e3\u028a\u0303p]}} 'ten', and undergo metathesis when that stop is glottal, as in {{IPA|/kahai\u0294 kak/ [kaha\u0294\u026akak]}} 'twenty'. An [[intrusive vowel]] {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306]}} appears between glottal stop and another consonant (though not semivowels), as in {{IPA|/ka\u0294h\u0268\u0258/ [ka\u0294.\u0259\u0306.h\u0268.\u0258]}} 'female leader'; this does not affect the pattern of stress.\n\nIn many words, a final vowel transcribed by K\u00e4hler is not found in Yoder.\n\nThe offglide of diphthongs lowers before glottal consonants, and a glottal stop may intrude when another word follows, as in {{IPA|/kahai\u0294 m\u0258h/}} {{IPA|[kaha\u0294\u026am\u0258\u0303h]}} 'another'.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! \n!

Approximant\n| \n| (l) \n| j ?\n| w ?\n|  \n|}\nYoder notes that the voiced stops {{IPA|[b~m, d~n]}} are in [[complementary distribution]], depending on whether the word has nasal vowels, but lists them separately. Voiced oral consonants, {{IPA|[b d l r]}}, do not occur in words with nasal consonants or vowels. Nasal consonants nasalize all vowels in a word, and there is therefore no contrast between {{IPA|[m n]}} and {{IPA|[b d]}} apart from the contrast between nasal and oral vowels. For example, with the oral stem ''tax'' 'bag', the possessive forms are ''tahi\u2019'' 'my bag' and ''tahib'' 'your bag', but with the nasal stem 'age', the forms are ''\u2019umunu\u2019'' 'my age' and ''\u2019umunum'' 'your age'.\n\n{{IPA|/l/}} occurs in only a few native words. {{IPA|/s ~ x/}} are infrequent and apparently a single phoneme; they only occur word finally, where they contrast with {{IPA|/h/}}: {{IPA|[x]}} occurs after the non-front vowels {{IPA|/\u0268 \u0259 u/}}, {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} after the front vowels {{IPA|/i a \u00e3/}}, and {{IPA|[s]}} after vowel sequences ending in {{IPA|/i/}} (including {{IPA|/ii, ui/}}). The resulting {{IPA|[a\u00e7 \u00e3\u00e7]}} may actually be {{IPA|/aix \u00e3\u0129x/}}, as most such words are attested with alternation like {{IPA|[ka\u00e7 ~ kais]}} 'box'. When a suffix is added, so that this consonant is no longer word-final, it becomes {{IPA|/h/}}, as in ''tahi\u2019'' 'my bag' above.\n\nNothofer is similar, but does not list the uncommon consonants {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/s ~ x/}} and counts {{IPA|[j w]}} as consonants rather than allophones of vowels. K\u00e4hler's dictionary adds {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, as well as {{IPA|/f t\u0283 d\u0292/}} as marginal phonemes, and claims that {{IPA|/t r/}} are only found in southern villages. However, Yoder states that at the time of his research in 2010 there were no differences among the six villages on Enggano Island, and that initial {{IPA|/t r/}} and final {{IPA|/t d/}} are rare in native words. Medial {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} are in free variation in a few words, with older people preferring {{IPA|/d/}} and younger speakers {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n==Grammar==\nThe main reference on the syntax and morphology of the Enggano language is the grammar produced by the German scholar Hans K\u00e4hler, which was published in 1940.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940}} There are also some references to syntax and morphology in more recent work, such as Yoder (2011) and Edwards (2015). This section compares some of the findings in K\u00e4hler (1940) with those of Yoder (2011), where the language appears to have undergone some changes.\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nThe pronouns listed in K\u00e4hler (1940) are as follows:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=106}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There is also a phonological process whereby a vowel is inserted between the [[glottal stop]] and the u in the 1sg enclitic ''-'u''. This is the final vowel of the stem to which the suffix attaches, e.g. ''euba'' 'house' > ''euba'au'' 'my house', ''ebohe'' 'spear' > ''ebohe'eu'' 'my {{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=96}} Possession can also be indicated using the proclitic pronouns above.\n\nThe pronouns listed in Yoder (2011) are as follows:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Enggano pronouns\n|-\n! Pronoun !! Independent !! Suffix\n|-\n| 1sg ||\u2019u || -\u2019\n|-\n| we.{{sc|EXCL}} ||\u2019a ||\n|-\n| we.{{sc|INCL}} ||\u2019ik || -k\n|-\n| 2sg ||\u2019\u0259\u2019 || -b ~ -m\n|-\n| 2pl ||\u2019ari || -du ~ -nu\n|-\n| 3sg ||ki || rowspan=2| -d(e) ~ -n(e)\n|-\n| 3pl ||ham\u0259\u2019 \n|-\n| this ||(p\u1ebd)\u2019\u1ebd\u2019\n|-\n| that ||\u2019\u1ebd\u00f5\u2019\n|-\n| who ||h\u00e3\n|-\n| what ||\u2019i.ah\n|}\nMost of these appear to be Austronesian: Compare Malay 1sg ''aku ~ ku'', 1.{{sc|ex}} ''kami'', 1.{{sc|in}} ''kita'', 2pl ''kalian'', 3sg/pl ''dia'', and suffixes 1sg ''-ku'', 2sg ''-mu'', 3sg ''-nya'', with *k, *t (d), *l, *m, *n having shifted to ''\u2019, k, r, b, d'' in Enggano, and with final consonants and (where possible) vowels being lost. The possessive suffixes appear on nouns, and they are often preceded by a vowel. Few forms are attested, but this vowel is ''i'' or ''ai'' after {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} (as with 'bag' in the phonology section), an [[echo vowel]] after several other consonants, and with several words not predictable on current evidence: ''\u2019eam \u2013 \u2019ami\u2019'' '(my) fishing rod'.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nNouns in Enggano can be subcategorised into three different classes: humans, proper nouns and common nouns. They take different articles to indicate singular and plural reference:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=85}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Articles in Enggano\n!Noun Class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n|Human\n|e-\n|ka-\n|-\n|Proper\n|\u2205-\n|\u2205-\n|-\n|Common\n|e-\n|e-\n|}\nBlench notes that ''e-'' may be a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]<ref name=\"Blench\" /> and Edwards argues that the articles not only mark [[noun class]] but also [[Grammatical case|case]].{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=60\u201361}} Nouns marked with ''e-'' and the other articles above can express both subjects and objects. The prefix ''e-'' can also be used to derive [[Gerund|gerunds]] from verbal stems.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940}} Plural number can also be indicated through [[reduplication]].{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=87}} In this case, the meaning is exhaustive, e.g. all of the nouns.\n\nNouns with an oblique function, e.g. those expressing nominal possessors, subjects of gerunds and any noun that follows the [[Oblique argument|oblique]] marker ''i'ioo'', take the article ''u-'' in place of ''e-''. Finally, [[Locative case|locative nouns]] take the locative prefix ''i-''.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940}}\n\nNouns in Enggano can be modified by demonstratives and relative clauses. As in other Austronesian languages, these typically follow the nominal head. There are three demonstratives in Enggano:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=92}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Demonstratives in Enggano\n!Demonstrative\n!Enggano\n!Rough Translation\n|-\n|Proximal\n|ei'ie\n|this\n|-\n|Medial\n|e'ana\n|that\n|-\n|Distal\n|ea'a\n|that\n|}\nRelative clauses are introduced by a relativiser ''m\u00f5'\u00f5''. K\u00e4hler suggests that older speakers of Enggano would use different relativisers depending on whether the head noun was singular (''hem\u00f5\u2019\u00f5'') or plural (''h\u00f5m\u00f5\u2019\u00f5''). However, in 1937 when he was conducting research, this practice was already uncommon in everyday language.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=93}} An example of a relative clause in Enggano is given below. This shows that demonstratives also follow relative clauses:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=93}}\n<br />\n{|\n|(1)\n|ka'u'ua-da'a\n|e-uba\n|m\u00f5'\u00f5\n|'am\u0169h\u00f5\n|ei'ie\n|-\n|\n|beautiful-<small>PRED</small>\n|<small>ART</small>-house\n|<small>REL</small>\n|big\n|<small>PROX.DEM</small>\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"5\" |'This house which is big is beautiful'\n|}\n\nK\u00e4hler describes some processes of [[Morphological derivation|nominal derivation]] in Enggano. Specifically, he notes that instrumental nouns can be formed via the addition of a vowel or ''paV-'' to a verbal root, e.g. ''poko'' 'to chisel' > ''e-opoko'' 'a chisel' or ''kui'' 'to sew' > ''e-paukui'' 'needle'. Locative nouns are formed with an ''-a'' suffix, e.g. ''parudu'' 'gather' > ''e-parudu-a'' 'gathering place'.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|pp=316\u2013318}}\n\n=== Verbs and Adjectives ===\nAdjectives commonly have prefixes ''ka-, ka\u2019-, ki-''; the first two are attested in derivation, and the last is assumed as it is very common and many such adjectives otherwise appear to be reduplicated, as in ''kinanap'' 'smooth' (Yoder 2011).\n\nVerbs may have one or two prefixes and sometimes a suffix. Attested prefixes are ''ba-, ba\u2019-, ia-, iah-, ka-, ka\u2019-, kah-, ki-, kir-, ko-, pa-, pah-, \u2019a-.'' The functions of these are unknown. ''Ki-'' and ''pa-'' may occur together, as in ''pe, pape, kipe, kipape'', all glossed as 'give'. The three attested verbal suffixes are ''-i, -ar, -a\u2019'' (Yoder 2011).\n\n=== Numerals ===\nThe counting system is, or at least once was, [[vigesimal]]: K\u00e4hler recorded ''kahai'i ekaka'' 'one man' = 20, ''ariba ekaka'' 'five man' = 100, ''kahai'i edudodoka'' 'one our-body' = 400. (The last may be based on two people counting together: each time I count all twenty of my digits, you count one of yours, so that when you have counted all of your digits, the number is 20\u00d720 = 400.) However, most people now use Malay numerals when speaking Enggano, especially for higher numbers. Yoder (2011) recorded the following:<ref>Also found [https://web.archive.org/web/20101230153201/http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/numeral/Enggano.htm here]</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n! Numeral !!

Compare the remaining ''-hai\u2019, -ru, -k\u0259r, -up, -rib'' with [[Lampung language|Lampung]] ''\u0259say, rua, t\u0259lu, \u0259pat, lima''; *s, *t, *l, *m have shifted to ''h, k, r, b'' in Enggano, and final consonants and (simple) vowels have been lost. \n''\u2019aki\u2019akin'' 6 may be reduplication of ''\u2019ak\u0259r'' 3. ''\u2019arib he \u2019aru'' 7 is 'five and two'. The two forms for 8 mean 'hugging', from the verb ''p\u00e3\u2019\u0129\u00f5p'' 'to hug', and 9 appears to be 'eight, one coming'; it may be shortened to ''kaba kahai\u2019'' (no ''-i'') in enumeration. Yoder believes 10 may also be a verb, based on an unelicited root ''\u2019\u00e3\u0169p'', as ''ki-'' and ''pa-'' are verbal prefixes (as in ''ki-pa-pe'' 'to give'); indeed, the apparent prefixes on 1\u20135 are identical to verbal prefixes as well.\n\nNumbers above 10 and 20 are formed with ''he ~ hi'' 'and': ''k\u0129p\u00e3\u2019\u00e3\u0169p he \u2019aru'' 'ten and two' for 12, ''kahai\u2019 kak he k\u0129p\u00e3\u2019\u00e3\u0169p'' 'twenty and ten' for 30. ''kak'' is 'person', so twenty is 'one person'. Multiples of twenty are formed from ''kak'', as in ''\u2019ak\u0259r kak he k\u0129p\u00e3\u2019\u00e3\u0169p'' 70, ''\u2019arib kak'' 100 (also ''kahai\u2019 ratuh'' from Malay ''ratus'').\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Blench, Roger, ''The Enggano: archaic foragers and their interactions with the Austronesian world.''
