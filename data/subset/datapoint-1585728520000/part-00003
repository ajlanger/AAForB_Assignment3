Robocalls are often associated with political and [[telemarketing]] phone campaigns, but can also be used for public-service or emergency announcements. Some robocalls use [[Personalized audio messaging|personalized audio messages]] to simulate an actual personal phone call. In 2019 the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation expanding the regulation of robocalls.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Timothy B. |title=Congress passes legislation expanding robocall penalties |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/12/congress-slaps-robocallers-with-10000-penalty-per-call/?bxid=5be9fceb2ddf9c72dc8994b7&cndid=30462369 |website=Ars Technica |accessdate=26 December 2019 |language=en-us |date=20 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==North America==\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Robocall scandal}}\n\nRobocalls can be and are legitimately used by mainstream political parties in Canada to reach voters. Controversy surrounded the use of robocalls during the [[2011 Canadian federal election]], leading [[Elections Canada]] and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] to investigate claims that robocalls were used in an attempt to dissuade voters from casting their ballot by falsely telling them their poll stations had changed locations.<ref>{{cite web |last=McGregor |first=Glen |title=Michael Sona to be sentenced Nov. 19 in robocalls affair |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/crown-seeks-increased-sentence-for-sona-over-2011-robocalls-case |website=Ottawa Citizen |publisher=Postmedia Network Inc. |accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Elections Canada traced the origin of the automated calls to a disposable cellphone registered to a fictional name \"Pierre Poutine\" at a phony address from 450 [[area code]] of [[Joliette]], [[Quebec]], and issued a subpoena to the cellphone provider that produced a list of outgoing calls from the same number. One of the calls was to the toll-free number used by customers of 2call.ca, a subsidiary of [[Edmonton]]-based [[Internet Service Provider]] RackNine, to phone in and record their outgoing messages. The burner cell phone belonging to \"Pierre Poutine\" was used to contact the owner of Racknine at his personal unlisted number and gave the name \"Pierre Jones\". This burner phone initiated a series of automated robocalls mostly in Guelph but with a few dozen in other ridings, that targeted mostly non-Conservative voters with false voting location changes. Some voters attended what they had been led to believe were their voting locations, and sometimes destroyed their voter registration cards in anger.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nIn November 2011, the investigator served RackNine with a production order for records and had the account holder associated with the bogus calls quickly identified.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maher and McGregor |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Tracking+telephone+tricks/6194759/story.html |title=Tracking telephone tricks |publisher=Ottawa Citizen |accessdate=28 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226004126/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Tracking+telephone+tricks/6194759/story.html |archivedate=February 26, 2012 }}</ref> Investigators have also examined the Conservative Party's CIMS voter database and showed that \"Pierre Poutine\" used the Conservative voter database to select whom to call.

Most products use methods similar to those used to mitigate [[VoIP spam|SPIT]] (spam over Internet telephony) and can be broadly categorised by the primary method used. However, due to the complexity of the problem, no single method is sufficiently reliable.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ziming_Zhao/publication/299794558_SoK_Everyone_Hates_Robocalls_A_Survey_of_Techniques_against_Telephone_Spam/links/5705504308ae13eb88b959e5.pdf |title=SoK: Everyone Hates Robocalls: A Survey of Techniques Against Telephone Spam |last=Huahong |first=Tu |last2=Doup\u00e9 |first2=Adam |year=2016 |publisher=University of Arizona |page=14 |format=pdf |last3=Zhao |first3=Ziming |last4=Ahn |first4=Gail-Joon |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nSolutions are available as both hardware and software products. [[Mobile app]]s are especially prevalent as they use techniques which do not require the modification of infrastructure. Many products are limited to use only on a single medium, such as traditional copper landlines, or [[mobile phone]] contracts from a specific [[mobile phone operator]].\n\n=== Blacklisting and whitelisting ===\nIn its simplest form, this method offers the ability to prevent further calls from phone numbers, once they are known to be a source of robocalls. Many mobile apps can prevent robocalls with a user generated [[Blacklist (computing)|blacklist]].\n\n[[File:Call-blocker-wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Landline call blocker in use]]\n\nFor landlines there are standalone call blockers which connect to the telephone. Various models work on blacklisting and whitelisting principles. Call blockers received attention from publications including [[Which?]] and [[Consumer Reports]] in the United Kingdom and United States respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leedham |first1=Robert |title=Call blocking devices \u2013 everything you need to know |url=http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/phones-3/call-blocking-devices-eveything-you-need-to-know/ |website=which.co.uk |publisher=Which? |accessdate=22 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701075905/http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/phones-3/call-blocking-devices-eveything-you-need-to-know/ |archivedate=2016-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rage against robocalls|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/07/robocall-blocker-review/index.htm|website=consumerreports.org|publisher=Consumer Reports|accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK [[BT Group|BT]] operates a service for landlines called Choose to Refuse which allows customers to block up to 10 phone numbers of their choice for a monthly fee.<ref>{{cite web|title=All about Choose to Refuse|url=http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/8500/~/all-about-choose-to-refuse|website=BT.com Help|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nA number of physical products have been developed for use with landlines. These are typically installed in homes and employ a [[Hard coding|hard coded]] or irregularly updated blacklist. Some models also have the function to create a user-generated whitelist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/07/robocall-blocker-review/index.htm|title=Robocall blocker review|last=|first=|date=14 August 2015|website=Consumer Reports|publisher=|language=en|publication-date=|access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref> Newer devices for landlines can use cloud based data to resolve the hard coded blacklist issues and allow you to create your own whitelist/blacklist.\n\n=== Crowdsourcing ===\nA more sophisticated model uses [[crowdsourcing]] to build a more comprehensive blacklist of robocall numbers. A notable example of this is the app [[Truecaller]], which requires users to provide access to their personal [[whitelist]] of genuine contacts in exchange for access to the larger crowdsourced database. In 2013, hackers gained access to Truecaller's database of known genuine numbers, highlighting the danger of centralising this information.<ref>{{cite web|title=Truecaller Statement|url=https://blog.truecaller.com/2013/07/18/truecaller-statement/|website=Truecaller Blog|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en|date=5 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ehackingnews.com/2013/07/truecaller-database-hacked-by-syrian.html|title=Truecaller Database hacked by Syrian Electronic Army|last=|first=|date=16 July 2013|work=|access-date=|via=E Hacking News}}</ref>\n\n=== CAPTCHA ===\nBuilding on the crowdsourcing model, [[Primus Canada]] launched a patented product called Telemarketing Guard for [[landlines]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Matthew|title=Stopping Fraudulent Robocall Scams: Can More Be Done?|url=https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/ef5915d3-e47e-4834-9a42-a4393ea03d9c/AB13B79566335ED657BFD89A085CCCA1.stein2.pdf|website=United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|accessdate=21 November 2016|page=1|language=en|format=pdf|date=10 July 2013}}</ref> It improves on previous models by including a [[CAPTCHA]] style challenge-response test.\n\nBased on a database developed from customer feedback, it filters suspected telemarketing calls to a system which challenges callers to record their name after pressing a button.

If they answer the phone, they are played the recording, at which point they can accept the call or decline and report it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Call-Blocking Technology|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/robocalls-all-rage-ftc-summit/robocalls-part7-call-blocking.pdf|website=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=21 November 2016|page=19|language=en|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Realtime analysis ===\nA major problem for the use of both blacklisting and whitelisting techniques is the practice of [[caller ID spoofing]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Scam Alert - How Scammers Use Caller ID Spoofing to Pose as You|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/news-events/bbb-scam-alerts/2014/06/scam-alert-how-scammers-use-caller-id-spoofing-to-pose-as-you/|website=Council of Better Business Bureaus|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en|date=20 June 2014}}</ref> which is prevalent as a result of the low [[Barriers to entry|barrier to entry]] in the [[Voice over IP|VoIP]] services market.<ref>{{harvnb|Huahong|Doup\u00e9|Zhao|Ahn|2016|p=2}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 the [[Federal Communications Commission]] proposed a framework for the telecommunications industry in the United States, which included a validation system at network level for robocalls from [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] sources by 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=CGB Announces Agenda for Robocall and Caller ID Spoofing Workshop on September 16, 2015|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-15-1001A1_Rcd.pdf|website=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=21 November 2016|pages=9880\u20139881|language=en|format=pdf|date=10 September 2015}}</ref> The final authentication task in the framework is the signing of all VoIP calls, which would allow carriers to reliably identify robocalls.\n\nUntil these goals are achieved, a more advanced method for blocking robocalls uses [[real-time business intelligence]] techniques to address the constantly changing identities of robocalls.

The FTC contends that the companies are operating a massive telemarketing scheme that uses random, pre-recorded phone calls to deceive consumers into thinking that their vehicle's warranty is about to expire. Consumers who respond to the robocalls are pressured to purchase extended service contracts for their vehicles, which the telemarketers falsely portray as an extension of the manufacturer's original warranty. According to papers the FTC filed with the court, however, the robocalls have prompted tens of thousands of complaints from consumers who are either on the United States National Do Not Call Registry or asked not to be called. Five telephone numbers associated with the defendants have generated a total of 30,000 Do Not Call complaints. Consumers received the robocalls at home, work, and on their cell phones, sometimes several times in one day. Businesses, government offices and even 911 dispatchers have been subjected to the calls.\n\nThose who answer the pre-recorded calls hear a message telling them that their vehicle warranty is about to expire and that they should \"extend coverage before it is too late\". They are told to \"press one\" to speak to a \"warranty specialist\". The \"specialists\" then mislead consumers into believing that their company is affiliated with the dealer or manufacturer of the consumer's vehicle. They try to sell consumers a service contract for between $2,000 and $3,000, which they falsely portray as an extension of the vehicle's original warranty. The seller of extended auto warranties sued by the FTC allegedly took in more than $10 million on the sale of these deceptively marketed service contracts. In their robocalls, the companies dialed every phone number within a particular area code and prefix sequentially, without knowing whether the consumers called were motorists or owned motor vehicles, or whether those consumers' numbers were on the Do Not Call Registry. Consumers who asked that the calls be stopped often were met with \"abusive behavior\" or were simply hung up on, according to the papers filed with the court. Some of the defendants used offshore shell corporations to try to avoid scrutiny, and a top officer in the telemarketing company bragged to prospective clients that he could operate outside the law without any chance of being caught by the FTC, the papers stated. This defendant also claimed that he makes 1.8 million dials per day and that he had done more than $40 million worth of dialing for extended warranty companies, including one billion dials on behalf of his largest client, according to the court papers filed by the FTC. In addition to the robocalls, the FTC charged that the company selling the warranties mails out deceptive postcards to consumers, warning them about the imminent expiration of their auto warranties. The postcards are designed to mislead consumers into believing that they are being contacted by their dealer or manufacturer, and the postcards offer consumers the chance to \"renew\" their original warranties.<ref name=\"case\">[https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090515-717706.html FTC: Judge Orders Halt To Robocalls Selling Deceptive Warranties], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', May 15, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714024144/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090515-717706.html |date=July 14, 2009 }}</ref> On May 15, 2009 U.S. District Judge [[John Francis Grady|John F.

Besides ordering a halt to the automatic telephone sales calls, Grady's order froze the assets of the two companies. The FTC alleged in its complaints that the calls were part of a deceptive scheme and asked the court to assure the assets will not be lost in case they might be needed to repay consumers who have been victimized. The FTC isn't immediately seeking civil fines against the companies but may do so later, agency officials said. Attorneys general in Arkansas, Indiana and Missouri have taken similar actions over calls offering extended warranties on automobiles.<ref name=\"case1\">[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFpGIsUi1KVrRr07BBoVqLrkz0ZQD986V9404 Judge blocks 'robo-calls' selling car warranties], [[Associated Press]], May 15, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607220858/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFpGIsUi1KVrRr07BBoVqLrkz0ZQD986V9404 |date=June 7, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Voice broadcasting]]\n* [[Ringless voicemail]]\n* [[Cold calling]]\n* [[Google Duplex]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://complaints.donotcall.gov/complaint/complaintcheck.aspx  National Do Not Call Registry Complaints]\n*[https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us Federal Communications Commission Consumer Complaint Center]\n*[https://www.nomorobo.com Nomorobo.com]\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n[[Category:Telemarketing]]\n[[Category:Neologisms]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Phone call delivering pre-recorded message}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Update|date=June 2019|reason=Information on the US FCC's [https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-affirms-robocall-blocking-default-protect-consumers-0 June 6, 2019, vote] needs to be included}}\n{{lead too short|date=May 2012}}\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=March 2010}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2012}}\n\nA '''robocall''' is a phone call that uses a computerized [[autodialer]] to deliver a pre-recorded message, as if from a [[robot]].

One of the calls was to the toll-free number used by customers of 2call.ca, a subsidiary of [[Edmonton]]-based [[Internet Service Provider]] RackNine, to phone in and record their outgoing messages. The burner cell phone belonging to \"Pierre Poutine\" was used to contact the owner of Racknine at his personal unlisted number and gave the name \"Pierre Jones\". This burner phone initiated a series of automated robocalls mostly in Guelph but with a few dozen in other ridings, that targeted mostly non-Conservative voters with false voting location changes.

[[Mobile app]]s are especially prevalent as they use techniques which do not require the modification of infrastructure. Many products are limited to use only on a single medium, such as traditional copper landlines, or [[mobile phone]] contracts from a specific [[mobile phone operator]].\n\n=== Blacklisting and whitelisting ===\nIn its simplest form, this method offers the ability to prevent further calls from phone numbers, once they are known to be a source of robocalls. Many mobile apps can prevent robocalls with a user generated [[Blacklist (computing)|blacklist]].\n\n[[File:Call-blocker-wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Landline call blocker in use]]\n\nFor landlines there are standalone call blockers which connect to the telephone. Various models work on blacklisting and whitelisting principles. Call blockers received attention from publications including [[Which?]] and [[Consumer Reports]] in the United Kingdom and United States respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leedham |first1=Robert |title=Call blocking devices \u2013 everything you need to know |url=http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/phones-3/call-blocking-devices-eveything-you-need-to-know/ |website=which.co.uk |publisher=Which? |accessdate=22 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701075905/http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/phones-3/call-blocking-devices-eveything-you-need-to-know/ |archivedate=2016-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rage against robocalls|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/07/robocall-blocker-review/index.htm|website=consumerreports.org|publisher=Consumer Reports|accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK [[BT Group|BT]] operates a service for landlines called Choose to Refuse which allows customers to block up to 10 phone numbers of their choice for a monthly fee.<ref>{{cite web|title=All about Choose to Refuse|url=http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/8500/~/all-about-choose-to-refuse|website=BT.com Help|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nA number of physical products have been developed for use with landlines. These are typically installed in homes and employ a [[Hard coding|hard coded]] or irregularly updated blacklist. Some models also have the function to create a user-generated whitelist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/07/robocall-blocker-review/index.htm|title=Robocall blocker review|last=|first=|date=14 August 2015|website=Consumer Reports|publisher=|language=en|publication-date=|access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref> Newer devices for landlines can use cloud based data to resolve the hard coded blacklist issues and allow you to create your own whitelist/blacklist.\n\n=== Crowdsourcing ===\nA more sophisticated model uses [[crowdsourcing]] to build a more comprehensive blacklist of robocall numbers. A notable example of this is the app [[Truecaller]], which requires users to provide access to their personal [[whitelist]] of genuine contacts in exchange for access to the larger crowdsourced database.

The FTC contends that the companies are operating a massive telemarketing scheme that uses random, pre-recorded phone calls to deceive consumers into thinking that their vehicle's warranty is about to expire. Consumers who respond to the robocalls are pressured to purchase extended service contracts for their vehicles, which the telemarketers falsely portray as an extension of the manufacturer's original warranty. According to papers the FTC filed with the court, however, the robocalls have prompted tens of thousands of complaints from consumers who are either on the United States National Do Not Call Registry or asked not to be called. Five telephone numbers associated with the defendants have generated a total of 30,000 Do Not Call complaints. Consumers received the robocalls at home, work, and on their cell phones, sometimes several times in one day. Businesses, government offices and even 911 dispatchers have been subjected to the calls.\n\nThose who answer the pre-recorded calls hear a message telling them that their vehicle warranty is about to expire and that they should \"extend coverage before it is too late\". They are told to \"press one\" to speak to a \"warranty specialist\". The \"specialists\" then mislead consumers into believing that their company is affiliated with the dealer or manufacturer of the consumer's vehicle. They try to sell consumers a service contract for between $2,000 and $3,000, which they falsely portray as an extension of the vehicle's original warranty. The seller of extended auto warranties sued by the FTC allegedly took in more than $10 million on the sale of these deceptively marketed service contracts. In their robocalls, the companies dialed every phone number within a particular area code and prefix sequentially, without knowing whether the consumers called were motorists or owned motor vehicles, or whether those consumers' numbers were on the Do Not Call Registry. Consumers who asked that the calls be stopped often were met with \"abusive behavior\" or were simply hung up on, according to the papers filed with the court. Some of the defendants used offshore shell corporations to try to avoid scrutiny, and a top officer in the telemarketing company bragged to prospective clients that he could operate outside the law without any chance of being caught by the FTC, the papers stated. This defendant also claimed that he makes 1.8 million dials per day and that he had done more than $40 million worth of dialing for extended warranty companies, including one billion dials on behalf of his largest client, according to the court papers filed by the FTC. In addition to the robocalls, the FTC charged that the company selling the warranties mails out deceptive postcards to consumers, warning them about the imminent expiration of their auto warranties. The postcards are designed to mislead consumers into believing that they are being contacted by their dealer or manufacturer, and the postcards offer consumers the chance to \"renew\" their original warranties.<ref name=\"case\">[https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090515-717706.html FTC: Judge Orders Halt To Robocalls Selling Deceptive Warranties], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', May 15, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714024144/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090515-717706.html |date=July 14, 2009 }}</ref> On May 15, 2009 U.S. District Judge [[John Francis Grady|John F. Grady]] issued the temporary restraining order against the defendants Transcontinental Warranty Inc. and Voice Touch Inc. Grady's orders also applied to Transcontinental CEO and President Christopher Cowart, Voice Touch executives James and Maureen Dunne, Voice Touch business partner Network Foundations LLC and Network Foundations executive Damian Kohlfeld. Besides ordering a halt to the automatic telephone sales calls, Grady's order froze the assets of the two companies. The FTC alleged in its complaints that the calls were part of a deceptive scheme and asked the court to assure the assets will not be lost in case they might be needed to repay consumers who have been victimized. The FTC isn't immediately seeking civil fines against the companies but may do so later, agency officials said. Attorneys general in Arkansas, Indiana and Missouri have taken similar actions over calls offering extended warranties on automobiles.<ref name=\"case1\">[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFpGIsUi1KVrRr07BBoVqLrkz0ZQD986V9404 Judge blocks 'robo-calls' selling car warranties], [[Associated Press]], May 15, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607220858/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFpGIsUi1KVrRr07BBoVqLrkz0ZQD986V9404 |date=June 7, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Voice broadcasting]]\n* [[Ringless voicemail]]\n* [[Cold calling]]\n* [[Google Duplex]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://complaints.donotcall.gov/complaint/complaintcheck.aspx  National Do Not Call Registry Complaints]\n*[https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us Federal Communications Commission Consumer Complaint Center]\n*[https://www.nomorobo.com Nomorobo.com]\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n[[Category:Telemarketing]]\n[[Category:Neologisms]]\n", "name_user": "Corn cheese", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReverse robocalling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocall"}
