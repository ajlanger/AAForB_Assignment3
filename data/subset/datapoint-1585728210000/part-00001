They realized that to take the idea further, they'd need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept [[Crash (computing)|crashing]], Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job.

Although Acton was working on another startup idea, he decided to join the company.<ref name=\"History\" /> In October 2009, Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in [[seed funding]], and Acton became a co-founder and was given a stake. He officially joined WhatsApp on November 1.<ref name=\"History\" /> After months at beta stage, the application launched in November 2009, exclusively on the App Store for the iPhone. Koum then hired a friend in [[Los Angeles]], Chris Peiffer, to develop a [[BlackBerry]] version, which arrived two months later.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nTo cover the primary cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free service to a paid one.

They realized that to take the idea further, they'd need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\".
