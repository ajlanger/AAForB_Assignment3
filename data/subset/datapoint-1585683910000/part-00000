Sydney's paternal grandmother approves of the hairstyle, but Syd's father Max thinks she is too young for such a hairdo, so he declines to take her to a hairstylist. Sydney defies her father and, with help from her friend Olive, tries to implement her new hairstyle without a stylist, but she accidentally turns her hair multiple colors. Max changes his mind and decides to take Sydney to a hairstylist to get her desired hairdo, and Syd keeps her failed hairdo a secret from him by wearing a wig. At the salon, Sydney's deceit is revealed when the wig comes off, and Max takes her back home before she can get a new hairdo. Meanwhile, flashback scenes set in 1992 show young Max wanting to bleach his hair so he can fit in better with a group of skateboarders called the Dog Boys. However, his mother disapproves. Max goes against her and applies hair bleach with help from his friend Leo, but it turns his hair red instead.

Sydney's paternal grandmother approves of the hairstyle, but Syd's father Max thinks she is too young for such a hairdo, so he declines to take her to a hairstylist. Sydney defies her father and, with help from her friend Olive, tries to implement her new hairstyle without a stylist, but she accidentally turns her hair multiple colors. Max changes his mind and decides to take Sydney to a hairstylist to get her desired hairdo, and Syd keeps her failed hairdo a secret from him by wearing a wig.
