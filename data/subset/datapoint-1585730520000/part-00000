It has been argued that this may reduce the ability to publish research results due to lack of sufficient funds, leading to some research not becoming a part of the public record.<ref>Eftekhari, A (2012) [http://research.criticpen.com/article/open-access-dream-m4zh Open Access Dream]. ''Critic Pen''.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505174602/http://research.criticpen.com/article/open-access-dream-m4zh |date=May 5, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nUnless discounts are available to authors from countries with low incomes or external funding is provided to cover the cost, article processing charges could exclude authors from developing countries or less well-funded research fields from publishing in open access journals. However, under the traditional model, the prohibitive costs of some non-open access journal subscriptions already place a heavy burden on the research community; and if green open access [[self-archiving]] eventually makes subscriptions unsustainable, the cancelled subscription savings can pay the [[gold open access]] publishing costs without the need to divert extra money from research.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harnad |first1=S. |authorlink=Stevan Harnad |year=2011 |title=Gold Open Access Publishing Must Not Be Allowed to Retard the Progress of Green Open Access Self-Archiving |url=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/21818/ |journal=Logos |volume=21 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=86\u201393 |doi=10.1163/095796511x559972 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901173641/http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/21818/ |archivedate=2011-09-01 |df= }}</ref> Moreover, many open access publishers offer discounts or publishing fee waivers to authors from developing countries or those suffering financial hardship. Self-archiving of non-open access publications provides a low cost alternative model.<ref>Corrado, E. (Spring 2005).

Robert Terry, Senior Policy Advisor at the Wellcome Trust, has said that he feels that 1\u20132% of their research budget will change from the creation of knowledge to the dissemination of knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |last=Open Access Now |title=Interview \u2013 Wellcome support for Open Access |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/openaccess/archive/?page=features&issue=18 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821073435/http://www.biomedcentral.com/openaccess/archive/?page=features&issue=18 |archivedate=August 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\nResearch institutions could cover the cost of open access by converting to an open access journal cost-recovery model, with the institutions' annual tool access subscription savings being available to cover annual open access publication costs.<ref>[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad, S]] (2007) [https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/265753/1/greenroad.html \"The Green Road to Open Access: A Leveraged Transition\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123021048/http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/265753/1/greenroad.html |date=2017-01-23 }}.

It is argued that this money comes predominantly from publicly funded scientific libraries as they purchase subscriptions or licenses in order to provide access to scientific journals for their members. The study was presented by the Max Planck Digital Library and found that subscription budgets would be sufficient to fund the open access publication charges, but does not address how unaffiliated authors or authors from institutions without funds will contribute to the scholarly record.<ref name=\"Max Planck Gesellschaft\">{{cite web |url=https://www.mpg.de/9202262/area-wide-transition-open-access |title=Area-wide transition to open access is possible: A new study calculates a redeployment of funds in Open Access |date=27 April 2015 |website=www.mpg.de/en |publisher=Max Planck Gesellschaft |access-date=2017-05-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616161356/https://www.mpg.de/9202262/area-wide-transition-open-access |archivedate=16 June 2017 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* University of California Libraries (2016) [https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ICIS-UC-Pay-It-Forward-Project-Final-Report.pdf Pay It Forward: Investigating a Sustainable Model of Open Access Article Processing Charges for Large North American Research Institutions]\n*{{cite web |title=Colour and page charges: results of a brief survey |author=Robert Kiley |year=2013 |url=http://www.researchinfonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Wellcome-survey-of-colour-and-page-charges-v-02.pdf}}\n* Curb, L.
