[[Seizure]]s, an irregular [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]], and breathing problems are often the first signs of this disorder. This disorder may also cause extremely low levels of [[ketone]]s (products of fat breakdown that are used for energy) and low blood sugar ([[hypoglycemia]]). Together, these two signs are called hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Other signs that are often present include ammonia in the blood ([[hyperammonemia]]), an enlarged liver ([[hepatomegaly]]), heart abnormalities ([[cardiomyopathy]]), and muscle weakness. This disorder can cause [[sudden infant death syndrome|sudden infant death]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n[[Image:Acyl-CoA from cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix.svg|thumb|left|300px|Acyl-CoA from cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix]]\n\n\nMutations in the ''[[SLC25A20]]'' [[gene]] lead to the production of a defective version of an enzyme called carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase.\n\nWithout this enzyme, long-chain fatty acids from food and fats stored in the body cannot be broken down and processed. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted into energy, which can lead to characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder, such as weakness, hypoglycemia, and an irregular heartbeat. Free long-chain fatty acids or those that are joined with carnitine can affect the electrical properties of cardiac cells causing an irregular heart beat ([[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]], which can lead to cardiac arrest). Fatty acids may also build up in tissues and can damage the heart, liver, and muscles, and cause more serious complications.\n\nThis condition has an [[autosomal recessive]] inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the gene - one from each parent - must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are [[Genetic carrier|carriers]] of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n{{Empty section|date=February 2017}}\n==Treatment==\n{{Empty section|date=February 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Primary carnitine deficiency]]\n*[[Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency]]\n*[[Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n''This article incorporates public domain text from [http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov The U.S. National Library of Medicine]''\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = \n| ICD10           = E71.3\n| ICD9            = \n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = 212138\n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = C562812\n| Orphanet        = 159\n| SNOMED CT       = 238003000\n}}\n\n{{Fatty-acid metabolism disorders}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carnitine-Acylcarnitine Translocase Deficiency}}\n[[Category:Autosomal recessive disorders]]\n[[Category:Rare diseases]]\n[[Category:Fatty-acid metabolism disorders]]\n", "text_old": "{{clear}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, ''Carnroviatonis'' \n| synonyms        = CATD, Carnroviatonis\n| image           = autorecessive.svg\n| caption         = Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.\n| pronounce       = \n| field           = \n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency''' is a rare, [[autosomal recessive]] [[metabolic disorder]] that prevents the body from converting long-chain fatty acids into energy, particularly during periods without food.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/carnitine-acylcarnitine-translocase-deficiency|title=CACT deficiency|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2017-02-27}}</ref> [[Carnitine]], a natural substance acquired mostly through the diet, is used by cells to process fats and produce energy.
