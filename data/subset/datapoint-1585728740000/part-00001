Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\".<ref name=W24/> In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures\u2014generally made up of [[eighth note|8th]] or [[sixteenth note|16th notes]]. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a [[staccato]] attack created by using a [[palm mute|palm-muted]] technique on the rhythm guitar.<ref>\"Master of Rhythm: The Importance of Tone and Right-hand Technique\", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 99</ref>\n\nBrief, abrupt, and detached [[rhythmic cell]]s are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called [[riff]]s, which help to establish thematic [[Hook (music)|hooks]]. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as [[whole note]]- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo [[power ballad]]s. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \"slow, even ponderous\".<ref name=W24/> By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos. In the 2000s decade, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 [[beats per minute]]) to extremely fast [[blast beat]] tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).<ref name=Berry/>  yes\n\n====Harmony====\nOne of the signatures of the genre is the guitar [[power chord]].<ref>Walser (1993), p. 2</ref> In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main [[interval (music)|interval]], generally the [[perfect fifth]], though an [[octave]] may be added as a doubling of the [[Root (chord)|root]].

Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] and [[Phrygian mode]]s.<ref>Walser (1993), p. 46</ref> Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-\u266dVI-\u266dVII, I-\u266dVII-(\u266dVI), or I-\u266dVI-IV-\u266dVII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and \u266dII (I-\u266dII-I, I-\u266dII-III, or I-\u266dII-VII for example). Tense-sounding [[chromatic]] or [[tritone]] relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.<ref>Marshall, Wolf. \"Power Lord\u2014Climbing Chords, Evil Tritones, Giant Callouses\", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 29</ref><ref name=MH>Dunn, Sam (2005).

American blues music was a major influence on the early [[British rock]]ers of the era. Bands like [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[The Yardbirds]] developed [[blues rock]] by recording covers of classic blues songs, often speeding up the [[tempo]]s. As they experimented with the music, the UK blues-based bands\u2014and the U.S. acts they influenced in turn\u2014developed what would become the hallmarks of heavy metal, in particular, the loud, distorted guitar sound.<ref name=vdqxbw/> [[The Kinks]] played a major role in popularising this sound with their 1964 hit \"[[You Really Got Me]]\".<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 18; Walser (1993), p. 9</ref>\n\nIn addition to The Kinks' [[Dave Davies]], other guitarists such as [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] and The Yardbirds' [[Jeff Beck]] were experimenting with feedback.<ref>Wilkerson (2006), p. 19.</ref><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=the-yardbirds-mn0000489303|pure_url=yes}} \"The Yardbirds\"].

Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. [[AC/DC]], which debuted with ''[[High Voltage (Australian album)|High Voltage]]'' in 1975, is a prime example.

After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain's [[Judas Priest]], which debuted with ''[[Rocka Rolla]]'' in 1974. In Christe's description,\n\n<blockquote>Black Sabbath's audience was ... left to scavenge for sounds with similar impact. By the mid-1970s, heavy metal aesthetic could be spotted, like a mythical beast, in the moody bass and complex dual guitars of [[Thin Lizzy]], in the stagecraft of [[Alice Cooper]], in the sizzling guitar and showy vocals of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and in the thundering medieval questions of Rainbow. ...

Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, [[disco]], and more mainstream rock.<ref name=gnwtey/> With the major labels fixated on punk, many newer British heavy metal bands were inspired by the movement's aggressive, high-energy sound and \"[[lo-fi (music)|lo-fi]]\", [[do it yourself]] ethos.

One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 [[US Festival]] in California, where the \"heavy metal day\" featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Judas Priest, and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 45</ref>\n\nBetween 1983 and 1984, heavy metal went from an 8 percent to a 20 percent share of all recordings sold in the U.S.<ref>Walser (1993), p. 12</ref> Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched, including ''[[Kerrang!]]'' (in 1981) and ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' (in 1984), as well as a host of fan journals. In 1985, ''Billboard'' declared, \"Metal has broadened its audience base. Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers. The metal audience has become older (college-aged), younger (pre-teen), and more female\".<ref>Walser (1993), pp. 12\u201313, 182 n. 35</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1980s, glam metal was a dominant presence on the U.S. charts, [[music television]], and the arena concert circuit.

Bridging the stylistic gap between hard rock and glam metal, [[New Jersey]]'s [[Bon Jovi]] became enormously successful with its third album, ''[[Slippery When Wet]]'' (1986).

However, the metal audience had begun to factionalize, with those in many underground metal scenes favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular style as \"light metal\" or \"hair metal\".<ref>Walser (1993), p. 14; Christe (2003), p. 170</ref>\n\nOne band that reached diverse audiences was [[Guns N' Roses]].

Other academics find that femininity is largely suppressed in metal culture, and that metal listeners are more likely to subscribe to misogynistic attitudes and stereotyping of [[gender role]]s, more so than in other music genres, with many of these findings corroborated by interviews with female participants.<ref name=\"Hill\">{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Rosemary Lucy|date=January 2016|chapter=Metal and Sexism|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309760064_Metal_and_Sexism|accessdate=February 15, 2020|title=Gender, Metal and the Media|pages=133-158|chapter-url-access=registration|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-55441-3_6}}</ref>\n\nIn response to such claims, debates in the metal media have centered on defining and contextualizing sexism. Hill claims that \"understanding what counts as sexism is complex and requires critical work by fans when sexism is normalised.\" Citing her own research, including interviews of British female fans, she finds that metal offers them an opportunity to feel liberated and genderless, albeit if assimilated into a culture that is largely neglectful of women.<ref name=\"Hill\"/>\n\nIn 2018, ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' editor Eleanor Goodman published an article titled \"Does Metal Have a Sexism Problem?\", interviewing veteran industry people and artists about the plight of women in metal. Some expressed a history of difficulty receiving professional respect from male counterparts. Among those interviewed was Wendy Dio, who had worked in label, booking, and legal capacities in the music industry before her marriage to and management of metal artist [[Ronnie James Dio]]. She said that after marrying Dio, her professional reputation became reduced to her marital role as his wife and her competency was questioned. Gloria Cavalera, former manager of [[Sepultura]] and wife of the band's former frontman [[Max Cavalera]], said that since 1996 she has received misogynistic hate-mail and death threats from fans accusing her of causing Max's departure from the group. She added that, \"Women take a lot of crap. This whole [[#metoo]] thing, do they think it just started? That has gone on since the pictures of the cavemen pulling girls by their hair. Women have always been pushed to the back. I personally think it\u2019s still difficult for women in the industry today, because there\u2019s not a lot of them, even in bands.\" In her article, Goodman also cited disproportionate gender figures in ''Metal Hammer''{{'}}s [[Facebook]] page \u2013 75% of [[Like (Facebook)|Likes]] being from men, as opposed to 25% from women \u2013 and in bands playing the 2018 [[Bloodstock Open Air]] festival \u2013 [[Nightwish]] was the only act of the 17 with a female member.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Goodman|first=Eleanor|date=February 12, 2018|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/does-metal-have-a-sexism-problem|title=Does Metal Have a Sexism Problem?|magazine=[[Metal Hammer]]|accessdate=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Heavy metal genres]]\n* [[List of heavy metal bands]]\n* [[List of heavy metal festivals]]\n* [[Timeline of heavy metal music]]\n{{-}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* [[Denis Arnold|Arnold, Denis]] (1983). \"Consecutive Intervals\", in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music|The New Oxford Companion to Music]]'', Volume 1: A-J.

Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an \"explicit display of emotion\" is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity.<ref>Weinstein (2000), p. 26</ref> Critic [[Simon Frith]] claims that the metal singer's \"tone of voice\" is more important than the lyrics.<ref>Cited in Weinstein (2000), p. 26</ref>\n\nThe prominent role of the bass is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element.

The upper stave is a [[palm mute|palm-muted]] [[rhythm guitar]] part. The lower stave is the drum part.{{Listen|title=Rhythmic Pattern Audio|filename=Heavy rythmic pattern audio.ogg|plain=yes|style=float:right}}]]\nThe rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\".<ref name=W24/> In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures\u2014generally made up of [[eighth note|8th]] or [[sixteenth note|16th notes]]. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a [[staccato]] attack created by using a [[palm mute|palm-muted]] technique on the rhythm guitar.<ref>\"Master of Rhythm: The Importance of Tone and Right-hand Technique\", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 99</ref>\n\nBrief, abrupt, and detached [[rhythmic cell]]s are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called [[riff]]s, which help to establish thematic [[Hook (music)|hooks]]. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as [[whole note]]- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo [[power ballad]]s. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \"slow, even ponderous\".<ref name=W24/> By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos. In the 2000s decade, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 [[beats per minute]]) to extremely fast [[blast beat]] tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).<ref name=Berry/>\n\n====Harmony====\nOne of the signatures of the genre is the guitar [[power chord]].<ref>Walser (1993), p. 2</ref> In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main [[interval (music)|interval]], generally the [[perfect fifth]], though an [[octave]] may be added as a doubling of the [[Root (chord)|root]]. When power chords are played on the lower strings at high volumes and with distortion, [[Resultant (organ)|additional low frequency sounds]] are created, which add to the \"weight of the sound\" and create an effect of \"overwhelming power\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walser |first1=Robert|date=2014|title=Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music|page=43 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}</ref> Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord,<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.melbay.com/guitarglossary.asp Glossary of Guitar Terms].

Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] and [[Phrygian mode]]s.<ref>Walser (1993), p. 46</ref> Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-\u266dVI-\u266dVII, I-\u266dVII-(\u266dVI), or I-\u266dVI-IV-\u266dVII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and \u266dII (I-\u266dII-I, I-\u266dII-III, or I-\u266dII-VII for example). Tense-sounding [[chromatic]] or [[tritone]] relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.<ref>Marshall, Wolf. \"Power Lord\u2014Climbing Chords, Evil Tritones, Giant Callouses\", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 29</ref><ref name=MH>Dunn, Sam (2005).

A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts.<ref>Kennedy (1985), \"Pedal Point\", p. 540</ref> According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are \"often quite complex\" and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is \"often very sophisticated\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walser |first1=Robert|date=2014|title=Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music|page=47 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}</ref> In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that \"heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated\" than other music researchers had realized.<ref name=\"Lilja 2009\"/>\n\n====Relationship with classical music====\n[[File:Ritchie Blackmore 1977.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A guitarist, Ritchie Blackmore, is shown playing a Fender electric guitar onstage. He has long hair.|[[Ritchie Blackmore]], founder of [[Deep Purple]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], known for the neoclassical approach in his guitar performances.]]\nRobert Walser stated that, alongside blues and R&B, the \"assemblage of disparate musical styles known&nbsp;... as '[[classical music]]{{'\"}} has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days. Also that metal's \"most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music.

Classical and metal are probably the two genres that have the most in common when it comes to feel, texture, creativity.\"<ref>Wagner, Wilson, p. 156.</ref>\n\nAlthough a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices\u2014classical in the [[art music]] tradition, metal in the [[popular music]] tradition. As [[musicologists]] Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note, \"Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of 'art traditions'. An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century [[Romanticism]]. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from \"art music'.\"<ref>See Cook and Dibben (2001), p. 56</ref>\n\n===Lyrical themes===\n{{Main|Heavy metal lyrics}}\nAccording to scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath, and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired, have concentrated lyrically \"on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music\". They take as an example Sabbath's second album ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' (1970), which \"included songs dealing with personal trauma\u2014'[[Paranoid (Black Sabbath song)|Paranoid]]' and '[[Fairies Wear Boots]]' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)\u2014as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory '[[War Pigs]]' and '[[Hand of Doom (Black Sabbath song)|Hand of Doom]]'.\"<ref>Hatch and Millward (1989), p. 167</ref> Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic\u2014a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam metal and nu metal bands.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 36</ref>\n\n[[File:King Diamond live 2006 Moscow 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Two members from the band King Diamond are shown at a concert performance.

The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy, where the periodic table organizes elements of both [[light metal|light]] and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] (e.g., uranium). An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by [[counterculture|countercultural]] writer [[William S. Burroughs]]. His 1962 novel ''[[The Soft Machine]]'' includes a character known as \"Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid\". Burroughs' next novel, ''[[Nova Express]]'' (1964), develops the theme, using ''heavy metal'' as a metaphor for addictive drugs: \"With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms\u2014Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes\u2014And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music\".<ref>[[William S.

[[AC/DC]], which debuted with ''[[High Voltage (Australian album)|High Voltage]]'' in 1975, is a prime example.

After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain's [[Judas Priest]], which debuted with ''[[Rocka Rolla]]'' in 1974. In Christe's description,\n\n<blockquote>Black Sabbath's audience was ... left to scavenge for sounds with similar impact. By the mid-1970s, heavy metal aesthetic could be spotted, like a mythical beast, in the moody bass and complex dual guitars of [[Thin Lizzy]], in the stagecraft of [[Alice Cooper]], in the sizzling guitar and showy vocals of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and in the thundering medieval questions of Rainbow. ...

This was followed by more women fronting heavy metal bands, such as [[Halestorm]], [[Within Temptation]], [[Arch Enemy]], and [[Epica (band)|Epica]] among others.

In the 1980s, American conservative groups like the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC) and the [[Parent Teacher Association]] (PTA) coopted feminist views on anti-woman violence to form attacks on metal's rhetoric and imagery.<ref name=\"Hill\"/> According to [[Robert Christgau]] in 2001, metal, along with hip hop, have made \"reflexive and violent sexism \u2026 current in the music\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Dansby|first=Andrew|date=February 16, 2001|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/critic-christgau-wraps-the-90s-249682/|title=Critic Christgau Wraps the '90s|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA general consensus among media and culture scholars posits sexism's existence, to varying degrees, across different subgenres and scenes of metal. In ''Gender, Metal and the Media'' (2016), British sociologist and music academic Rosemary Lucy Hill cites a variety of historical research and finds, in summary, \"sexist attitudes and behaviours of peers at hard rock and metal events; symbolic violence, such as the violently misogynistic imagery in artwork and lyrics; women being faced with a barrage of questions to prove the authenticity of their fandom; the dominance of men in bands and prejudice faced by women musicians; and women fans being represented in the media as groupies, more interested in the musician than the music\". Other academics find that femininity is largely suppressed in metal culture, and that metal listeners are more likely to subscribe to misogynistic attitudes and stereotyping of [[gender role]]s, more so than in other music genres, with many of these findings corroborated by interviews with female participants.<ref name=\"Hill\">{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Rosemary Lucy|date=January 2016|chapter=Metal and Sexism|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309760064_Metal_and_Sexism|accessdate=February 15, 2020|title=Gender, Metal and the Media|pages=133-158|chapter-url-access=registration|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-55441-3_6}}</ref>\n\nIn response to such claims, debates in the metal media have centered on defining and contextualizing sexism. Hill claims that \"understanding what counts as sexism is complex and requires critical work by fans when sexism is normalised.\" Citing her own research, including interviews of British female fans, she finds that metal offers them an opportunity to feel liberated and genderless, albeit if assimilated into a culture that is largely neglectful of women.<ref name=\"Hill\"/>\n\nIn 2018, ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' editor Eleanor Goodman published an article titled \"Does Metal Have a Sexism Problem?\", interviewing veteran industry people and artists about the plight of women in metal. Some expressed a history of difficulty receiving professional respect from male counterparts. Among those interviewed was Wendy Dio, who had worked in label, booking, and legal capacities in the music industry before her marriage to and management of metal artist [[Ronnie James Dio]]. She said that after marrying Dio, her professional reputation became reduced to her marital role as his wife and her competency was questioned. Gloria Cavalera, former manager of [[Sepultura]] and wife of the band's former frontman [[Max Cavalera]], said that since 1996 she has received misogynistic hate-mail and death threats from fans accusing her of causing Max's departure from the group. She added that, \"Women take a lot of crap. This whole [[#metoo]] thing, do they think it just started? That has gone on since the pictures of the cavemen pulling girls by their hair. Women have always been pushed to the back. I personally think it\u2019s still difficult for women in the industry today, because there\u2019s not a lot of them, even in bands.\" In her article, Goodman also cited disproportionate gender figures in ''Metal Hammer''{{'}}s [[Facebook]] page \u2013 75% of [[Like (Facebook)|Likes]] being from men, as opposed to 25% from women \u2013 and in bands playing the 2018 [[Bloodstock Open Air]] festival \u2013 [[Nightwish]] was the only act of the 17 with a female member.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Goodman|first=Eleanor|date=February 12, 2018|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/does-metal-have-a-sexism-problem|title=Does Metal Have a Sexism Problem?|magazine=[[Metal Hammer]]|accessdate=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Heavy metal genres]]\n* [[List of heavy metal bands]]\n* [[List of heavy metal festivals]]\n* [[Timeline of heavy metal music]]\n{{-}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* [[Denis Arnold|Arnold, Denis]] (1983). \"Consecutive Intervals\", in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music|The New Oxford Companion to Music]]'', Volume 1: A-J.
