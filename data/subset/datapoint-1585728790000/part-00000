{"title_page": "Free energy perturbation", "text_new": "'''Free energy perturbation''' ('''FEP''') is a method based on [[statistical mechanics]] that is used in [[computational chemistry]] for computing [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] differences from [[molecular dynamics]] or [[Metropolis Monte Carlo]] simulations.\n\n== Background ==\nThe FEP method was introduced by Robert W.

In practice, one\nruns a normal simulation for state '''A''', but each time a\nnew configuration is accepted, the energy for state '''B''' is also computed. The difference\nbetween states '''A''' and '''B''' may be in the atom types involved, in which case the \u0394''F''\nobtained is for \"mutating\" one molecule onto another, or it may be a difference of\ngeometry, in which case one obtains a free energy map along one or more [[reaction coordinate]]s. \nThis free energy map is also known as a ''[[potential of mean force]]'' or PMF.\n\nFree energy perturbation calculations only converge properly when the difference\nbetween the two states is small enough; therefore it is usually necessary to divide a\nperturbation into a series of smaller \"windows\", which are computed independently.\nSince there is no need for constant communication between the simulation for one\nwindow and the next, the process can be trivially parallelized by running each window on\na different CPU, in what is known as an \"[[embarrassingly parallel]]\" setup.\n\n== Application ==\nFEP calculations have been used for studying host\u2013guest binding energetics,\n[[pKa]] predictions, [[solvent effects]] on reactions, and enzymatic reactions. Other applications are the [[Virtual screening|virtual Screening]] of ligands in [[Drug discovery|drug Discovery]], as well as for ''In silico'' [[mutagenesis]] studies. For the\nstudy of reactions it is often necessary to involve a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] (QM) representation of\nthe reaction center because the [[molecular mechanics]] (MM) [[force field (chemistry)|force field]]s used for FEP simulations can't handle\nbreaking bonds. A hybrid method that has the advantages of both QM and MM\ncalculations is called [[QM/MM]].\n\n[[Umbrella sampling]] is another free-energy calculation technique that is typically used for calculating the free-energy change associated with a change in \"position\" coordinates as opposed to \"chemical\" coordinates, although Umbrella sampling can also be used for a chemical transformation when the \"chemical\" coordinate is treated as a dynamic variable (as in the case of the Lambda dynamics approach of Kong and Brooks).\nAn alternative to free energy perturbation for computing potentials of mean force in chemical space is [[thermodynamic integration]].
