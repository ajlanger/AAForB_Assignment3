Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.\n\nThe engines are hand built by only four specially trained mechanics called \"Takumi Craftsmens\" on a special line at Nissan's Yokohama plant and their names are badged on every GT-R engine.

Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.\n\nThe engines are hand built by only four specially trained mechanics called \"Takumi Craftsmens\" on a special line at Nissan's Yokohama plant and their names are badged on every GT-R engine.
