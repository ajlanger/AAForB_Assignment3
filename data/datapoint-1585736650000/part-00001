The term ''[[Shaitan]]'' is more prevalent, although Iblis is sometimes referred to as Shaitan; the terms are not interchangeable. The different fragments of Iblis' story are scattered across the Quran. In the aggregate, the story can be summarized as follows:<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter J.|last=Awn|title=Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Ibl\u012bs in Sufi Psychology|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=[[Leiden]]|date=1983|ISBN=978-9004069060|page=18}}</ref>\n\nWhen God created Adam, He ordered all the [[angels in Islam|angels]] to bow before the new creation. All the angels bowed down, but Iblis refused to do so. He argued that since he himself was created from fire, he is superior to humans, made from Clay-mud, and that he should not prostrate himself before Adam.<ref>{{cite quran|7|12|s=ns}}</ref> As punishment for his haughtiness, God banished Iblis from heaven and condemned him to hell. Later, Iblis made a request for the ability to try to mislead Adam and his descendants. God granted his request but also warned him that he will have no power over God's servants.<ref>{{cite quran|17|65|s=ns|q=\"As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them:\" Enough is thy Lord for a Disposer of affairs.}}</ref>\n\n===Sufism===\n[[Sufism]] developed another perspective of Iblis' refusal by regarding [[Muhammed in Islam|Muhammed]] and Iblis as the two true [[monotheism|monotheists]]. Therefore, some Sufis hold, Iblis refused to bow to Adam because he was devoted to God alone and refused to bow to anyone else. By weakening the evil in the Satanic figure, [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] is also degraded, that corresponds with the [[Sufi cosmology]] of [[Sufi metaphysics#Wa\u1e25dat al-Wuj\u016bd (Unity of Existence)|unity of existence]] rejecting dualistic tendencies. The belief in dualism or that ''evil'' is caused by something else than God, even if only by one's own will, is regarded as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' by some Sufis.<ref name=\"Awn, page 104\">Awn, page 104</ref> For Iblis' preference to be damned to hell, than prostrating himself before someone else other than the \"Beloved\" (here referring to God), Iblis also became an example for [[unrequited love]].\n\nA famous narration about an encounter between [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] and Iblis  on the slopes of [[Mount Sinai|Sinai]], told by [[Mansur al-Hallaj]], [[Ruzbihan Baqli]]<ref name=\"Awn, page 104\"/> and [[Ghazzali]], emphasizes the nobility of Iblis. Accordingly, Moses asks Iblis why he refused God's order. Iblis replied that the command was actually a test. Then Moses replied, obviously Iblis was punished by being turned from an angel to a [[shaitan|devil]]. Iblis responds, his form is just temporary and his love towards God remains the same.<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Gramlich|title=Der eine Gott: Grundz\u00fcge der Mystik des islamischen Monotheismus|publisher=[[Otto Harrassowitz Verlag]]|location=Weisbaden, Germany|date=1998|ISBN=978-3-447-04025-9|page=44|language=German}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first1=Joseph E.

[[Rumi]]'s viewpoint on Iblis is much more in tune with Islamic orthodoxy. Rumi views Iblis as the manifestation of the [[Seven deadly sins|great sins]] of [[pride|haughtiness]] and [[envy]]. He states: \"(Cunning) intelligence is from Iblis, and love from Adam.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Annemarie|last=Schimmel|title=The Triumphal Sun: A Study of the Works of Jalaloddin Rumi|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|location=Albany, New York|date=1993|ISBN=978-0-791-41635-8|page=255}}</ref> Iblis represents the principle of  \"one-eyed\" intellect; he only saw the outward earthly form of Adam, but was blind to the Divine spark hidden in him, using an illicit method of comparison.<ref>{{cite book|first=Wal\u012b|last=All\u0101h al-Dihlaw\u012b|title=Sh\u0101h Wal\u012b All\u0101h of Delhi's Hujjat All\u0101h Al-b\u0101ligha|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=Albany, New York|date=1996|ISBN=978-9-004-10298-9|page=350}}</ref> [[Hasan of Basra]] holds that Iblis was the first who used \"analogy\", comparing himself to someone else, this causing his sin.

Edmund Teuma ''THE NATURE OF \"IBLI$H IN THE QUR'AN AS INTERPRETED BY THE COMMENTATORS'' 1980 University of Malta. Faculty of Theology</ref> regard him as an angel. Tabari argued for an angelic origin of Iblis in his  [[Tafsir al-Tabari|tafsir]]: <blockquote>\"The reason people held this opinion [that Iblis was not an angel] is that God stated in His Book that He created Iblis from the fire of the Samum (15:27) and from smokeless fire (55:15), but did not state  that He created the angels from any like of that. And God states he was of the jinn, so they said that it is not possible that he should be related to that which God does not relate him to; they said that Iblis had progeny and offspring, but the angels do not procreate or have children.\n\n(. .)\n\nBut these reasons only bespeak the weakness of these people's knowledge, for there is nothing objectionable in that God should have created the categories of His angels from all kinds of things that He had created: He created some of them from light, some of them from fire, and some of them from what He willed apart from that. There is thus nothing in God's omitting to state what He created His angels from, and in His stating what He created Iblis from, which necessarily implies that Iblis is outside of the meaning of [angel], for it is possible that He created a category of His angels, among whom was Iblis, from fire, and even that Iblis was unique in that He created him, and no other angels of His, from the fire of the Samum.\nLikewise, he cannot be excluded from being an angel by fact that he had progeny or offspring, because passion and lust, from which the other angels were free, was compounded in him when God willed disobedience in him. As for God's statement that he was &lt;one of the jinn>, it is not to be rejected that everything which hides itself (ijtanna) from the sight is a 'jinn', . . . and Iblis and the angels should then be among them, because they hide themselves from the eyes of mankind.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn the other hand, the Quranic exegete [[Ibn Kathir]], preferred to regard Iblis as a genie, an opinion shared by scholars such as Hasan of Basra, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Mahmoud M.|last=Ayoub|title=The Qur'an and Its Interpreters, Volume 1, Band 1|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|location=Albany, New York|date=1984|ISBN=978-0-791-49546-9|page=86}}</ref> [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> [[Ibn Taimiyya]] and [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Al-Munajjid]], stating in his tafsir:\n<blockquote>\n\"When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis was included in this command. Although Iblis was not an angel, he was trying- and pretending - to imitate the angels' behavior and deeds, and this is why he was also included in the command to the angels to prostrate before Adam. Satan was criticized for defying that command, (. . .)\n\n(So they prostrated themselves except Iblis. He was one of the Jinn;) meaning, his original nature betrayed him. He had been created from smokeless fire, whereas the angels had been created from light, (. . .)\n\nWhen matters crucial every vessel leaks that which to contains and is betrayed by its true nature. Iblis used to do, what the angels did and resembled them in their devotion and worship, so he was included when they were addressed, but he disobeyed and went what he was told to do. So Allah points out here that he was one of the Jinn, he was created from fire, as He says elsewhere.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe common viewpoints about Iblis' affiliation can be summarized as follows:<ref name=\"Dictionary of Islam\">{{cite book|first1=Patrick|last1=Hughes|first2=Thomas Patrick|last2=Hughes|title=Dictionary of Islam|publisher=[[Asian Educational Services]]|location=New Delhi, India|date=1995|ISBN=978-8-120-60672-2|page=135}}</ref>\n* Iblis is from a type of angel, who was created from fire<ref name=\"Vicchio, page 183\"/>\n* Iblis is a genie differing from the angels, who are made out of light.\n* Once an angel, Iblis turned into a genie by his act of disobedience.\nApart from the Quranic narrative, within Islamic exegesis offers two different accounts of Iblis' origin, according to one, he was a noble angel, to the other he was an ignoble jinn, who worked his way up to heaven.<ref>Muhammad Mahmoud. \u201cThe Creation Story in \u2018S\u016brat Al-Baqara,\" with Special Reference to Al-\u1e6cabar\u012b's Material: An Analysis.\u201d Journal of Arabic Literature, vol. 26, no. 1/2, 1995, pp. 201\u2013214.

At the same time, he was the closest to the [[Throne of God]]. God gave him authority over the lower heavens and the earth. Iblis is also considered as the leader of those angels who battled the earthly jinn. Therefore, Iblis and his army drove the jinn to the edge of the world, [[Mount Qaf]]. Knowing about the corruption of the former earthen inhabitants, Iblis protested, when he was instructed to prostrate himself before the new earthen inhabitant, that is Adam. He assumed that the angels who ''praise God's glory day and night'' are superior in contrast to the mud-made human and their bodily flaws.<ref>{{cite book|first=James William|last=Hampson Stobart|title=Islam & Its Founder|series=Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|date=1876|publisher=[[Oxford University]]|location=Oxfordshire, England|page=114}}</ref> He even regarded himself superior in comparison to the other angels, since he was (one of those) created from fire.

Both Western academics and Islamic scholars debated the essence of Iblis.\n\n=== In academic discourse ===\nIn most Surahs, it seems to be implied that Iblis is one of the angels. The motif of prostrating angels with one exception among them, already appeared in early Christian writings and apocalyptic literature. For this reason, one might assume Iblis was intented to be an angel.<ref>Jeffrey Burton Russell ''Lucifer: The Devil in the Middle Ages'' Cornell University Press, 1986 isbn 9780801494291 p. 56</ref> [[Jacques Waardenburg]] argues, that Iblis identification with the jinn in later Surahs, is a result of synthesis of Arabian paganism with Judeo-Christian lore. Accordingly, Muhammad would have demonized the jinn in later Surahs, making Iblis a jinni, whereas he had been an angel before.<ref>Jacques Waardenburg Islam: Historical, Social, and Political Perspectives Walter de Gruyter, 2008 {{ISBN|978-3-110-20094-2}} p. 40</ref> Otherwise, the theory that the essence of angels differs from that of Satan and his hosts, might originated in the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]] and be introduced by an Christian informant to the early Muslims, and not introduced by Muhammad.<ref>Jung, L.

Further, Iblis is not described as created from fire, when the Quran identifies Iblis with the jinn.<ref name=\"Eichler, Paul Arno p. 60\"/> Since the Quran itself does not speak of angels as created from another sources than fire, Iblis might also have represented an angel in the sense of [[Ancient Near East]]ern traditions, such as a [[Seraph]].<ref name=\"Dammen McAuliffe 2003 46\"/> Some scholars objected that the term ''jinni'' does not necessarily exclude Iblis from the angels, since it has been sugggsted that in [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]], the term denoted any type of invisible creature.<ref>{{cite book|first=Amira|last=El-Zein|title=Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|location=Syracuse, New York|date=2009|ISBN=978-0815635147|page=34}}</ref>\n\nBut other scholars argue, that Islam nevertheless distinguishes between angels and other kinds of supernatural creatures. Angels would lack the ability to disobey, and taking their constant loyalty as characteristical for the Islamic angels. Further, since the Quran refers to Iblis' progeny, [[List of Islamic studies scholars|Islamic study scholar]] [[Fritz Meier]] also insists, that the Islamic Iblis can not be held as an angel, since angels have no progeny by definition.<ref>N\u00fcnlist, page 54</ref> Otherwise [[Walther Eickmann]] argued that the ''progeny of Iblis'' does not correspond with \"progeny\" in a literal sense, but just refers to the cohorts of Iblis.<ref>{{cite book|first=Walther|last=Eickmann|title=Die Angelologie und D\u00e4monologie des Korans im Vergleich zu der Engel- und Geisterlehre der Heiligen Schrift|publisher=Eger|location=New York City|date=1908|page=27|language=German}}</ref> On another place in the Quran, the progeny of Iblis are said to be created, therefore they can not be literal progeny.<ref>Eichler, Paul Arno, 1889- ''Die Dschinn, Teufel und Engel in Koran'' p. 59</ref> Regarding the doctrine of infallible angels, one might argue that the motif of fallen angels is nevertheless not absent within Islamic traditions and are therefore, angels are not necessarily always obedient. Although Iblis is described as an infidel ([[kafir]]) in the Quran, he did not necessary [[Sin in Islam|sin]], since in early Islamic period, supernatural creatures were not expected to understand sin or expiate it. Therefore, Iblis would have been created as a rebellious angel.<ref>Basharin, pages 119\u2013138</ref>\n\n=== Among Muslim scholars ===\nAlthough the Quran seems to be clear about Iblis' identification with the jinn in the Quran, scholars in favor for Iblis' angelic origin argue, that the term ''jinni'' with the [[suffix]] ''i'' refers to guardians of ''[[jannah]]'', a sub-category of \"fiery angels\". Although angels in Islam are commonly thought to be created from light, angels, or at least the fiercer among them, are also identified as created from fire. Reason for that might be the phonetical similarity between fire (''nar'') and light (nur) in Islam. Sometimes the term ''nar'' is better understood as ''hot light of the sun'' instead of fire, contrasted by ''nur'' referring to ''cold light of the moon''.<ref>Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02be\u0101n'' Volume 5 Georgetown University, Washington DC p. 118</ref> On the other hand, scholars arguing that the term refers to jinn, and not a category of angels,  tried to explain his stay among the angels. According to a narrative provided by [[Ibn Kathir]], Iblis was once an ordinary jinn on earth, but, due to his piety and constant worship, elevated among the angels. He lived there for thousands of years, until his non-angelic origin was forgotten and only God remembered Iblis' true identity. When God commanded the angels, Iblis, due to his rank among the angels included, to prostrate himself before Adam, Iblis revealed his true nature. By his refusal his true nature betrayed him, leading to his downfall.<ref>{{cite book|first=Muhammad|last=Saed Abdul-Rahman|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir Juz' 1 (Part 1): Al-Fatihah 1 to Al-Baqarah 141 2nd Edition|publisher=MSA Publication Limited|location=London, England|date=2013|ISBN=978-1-861-79826-8|page=136}}</ref> Other scholars, such as [[Hasan of Basra]] and  [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], do not provide an explanation for his abode among the angels, by extension of a special narrative. Instead they argue, Iblis', depicted as the first of jinn, and not as one of many jinn, stay in heaven is self-explanatory, because every creature is created in heaven first. Here, although created in heaven, Iblis is not regarded as an angel, but the equivalent father of the jinn, compared to what Adam is to humanity. Iblis, as the father of the jinn, was cast out of heaven due to his own sin, just as Adam was banished after his corresponding transgression of God's order not to eat from the [[Forbidden fruit|Forbidden Tree]].\n\nThose scholars, who argue against Iblis' angelic origin also refer to his progeny, since angels do not procreate in Islam. [[Tabari]] who defended Iblis' angelic depiction, argues that Iblis did not procreated until he lost his angelic state and became a devil. Therefore, as an angel, Iblis did not procreated. According to some Islamic traditions, Iblis is an asexual entity, just like other angels or a hermaphrodite creature, whose children split from himself, as devils (''[[Shayatin|\u0161ay\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn]]'') do, but not the jinn. Another central argument to determine Iblis essence discusses Iblis' ability to disobey. As angels are seen as servants of God, Iblis' should not be able to disobey. This argument had been essential for the advocates who reject the identification with Iblis with one of the angels. As a jinni however, Iblis could be given the ability to choose to obey or disobey.<ref>El-Zein, page 46</ref> Scholars who regard Iblis as an angel, do not see Iblis' refusal as an act of sin, to which angels are incappable of, but as a sign of predestination. Therefore, Iblis has been created, differing from his fellow angels, from fire, thus God installed a rebellious nature in him, to endow him with the task to seduce humans, comparable as other angels are endowed with tasks corresponding to their own nature<ref name=\"Awn, page 97\">Awn, page 97</ref> and created for this purpose from fire differing from the other angels.<ref name=\"Awn, page 97\"/> Thus, Iblis is seen as an instrument of God, not as an entity who freely choose to disobey.<ref>Schimmel, page 212</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Ludo|last=Abicht|title=Islam & Europe: Challenges and Opportunities|publisher=[[Leuven University Press]]|location=Leuven, Belgium|date=2008|ISBN=978-9-058-67672-6|page=128}}</ref><ref>Awn, page 86</ref> Other scholars gave explanations why an angel should choose to disobey and explain that Iblis was, as the teacher of angels, more knowledgeable than the others.<ref>Awn, page 50</ref><ref>Abicht, page 128</ref> Angels might be distinguished by their degree of obedience.

The term ''[[Shaitan]]'' is more prevalent, although Iblis is sometimes referred to as Shaitan; the terms are not interchangeable. The different fragments of Iblis' story are scattered across the Quran. In the aggregate, the story can be summarized as follows:<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter J.|last=Awn|title=Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Ibl\u012bs in Sufi Psychology|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=[[Leiden]]|date=1983|ISBN=978-9004069060|page=18}}</ref>\n\nWhen God created Adam, He ordered all the [[angels in Islam|angels]] to bow before the new creation. All the angels bowed down, but Iblis refused to do so. He argued that since he himself was created from fire, he is superior to humans, made from Clay-mud, and that he should not prostrate himself before Adam.<ref>{{cite quran|7|12|s=ns}}</ref> As punishment for his haughtiness, God banished Iblis from heaven and condemned him to hell. Later, Iblis made a request for the ability to try to mislead Adam and his descendants. God granted his request but also warned him that he will have no power over God's servants.<ref>{{cite quran|17|65|s=ns|q=\"As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them:\" Enough is thy Lord for a Disposer of affairs.}}</ref>\n\n===Sufism===\n[[Sufism]] developed another perspective of Iblis' refusal by regarding [[Muhammed in Islam|Muhammed]] and Iblis as the two true [[monotheism|monotheists]]. Therefore, some Sufis hold, Iblis refused to bow to Adam because he was devoted to God alone and refused to bow to anyone else. By weakening the evil in the Satanic figure, [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] is also degraded, that corresponds with the [[Sufi cosmology]] of [[Sufi metaphysics#Wa\u1e25dat al-Wuj\u016bd (Unity of Existence)|unity of existence]] rejecting dualistic tendencies. The belief in dualism or that ''evil'' is caused by something else than God, even if only by one's own will, is regarded as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' by some Sufis.<ref name=\"Awn, page 104\">Awn, page 104</ref> For Iblis' preference to be damned to hell, than prostrating himself before someone else other than the \"Beloved\" (here referring to God), Iblis also became an example for [[unrequited love]].\n\nA famous narration about an encounter between [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] and Iblis  on the slopes of [[Mount Sinai|Sinai]], told by [[Mansur al-Hallaj]], [[Ruzbihan Baqli]]<ref name=\"Awn, page 104\"/> and [[Ghazzali]], emphasizes the nobility of Iblis. Accordingly, Moses asks Iblis why he refused God's order. Iblis replied that the command was actually a test. Then Moses replied, obviously Iblis was punished by being turned from an angel to a [[shaitan|devil]].

Tabari argued for an angelic origin of Iblis in his  [[Tafsir al-Tabari|tafsir]]: <blockquote>\"The reason people held this opinion [that Iblis was not an angel] is that God stated in His Book that He created Iblis from the fire of the Samum (15:27) and from smokeless fire (55:15), but did not state  that He created the angels from any like of that. And God states he was of the jinn, so they said that it is not possible that he should be related to that which God does not relate him to; they said that Iblis had progeny and offspring, but the angels do not procreate or have children.\n\n(. .)\n\nBut these reasons only bespeak the weakness of these people's knowledge, for there is nothing objectionable in that God should have created the categories of His angels from all kinds of things that He had created: He created some of them from light, some of them from fire, and some of them from what He willed apart from that. There is thus nothing in God's omitting to state what He created His angels from, and in His stating what He created Iblis from, which necessarily implies that Iblis is outside of the meaning of [angel], for it is possible that He created a category of His angels, among whom was Iblis, from fire, and even that Iblis was unique in that He created him, and no other angels of His, from the fire of the Samum.\nLikewise, he cannot be excluded from being an angel by fact that he had progeny or offspring, because passion and lust, from which the other angels were free, was compounded in him when God willed disobedience in him. As for God's statement that he was &lt;one of the jinn>, it is not to be rejected that everything which hides itself (ijtanna) from the sight is a 'jinn', . . . and Iblis and the angels should then be among them, because they hide themselves from the eyes of mankind.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn the other hand, the Quranic exegete [[Ibn Kathir]], preferred to regard Iblis as a genie, an opinion shared by scholars such as Hasan of Basra, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Mahmoud M.|last=Ayoub|title=The Qur'an and Its Interpreters, Volume 1, Band 1|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|location=Albany, New York|date=1984|ISBN=978-0-791-49546-9|page=86}}</ref> [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> [[Ibn Taimiyya]] and [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Al-Munajjid]], stating in his tafsir:\n<blockquote>\n\"When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis was included in this command. Although Iblis was not an angel, he was trying- and pretending - to imitate the angels' behavior and deeds, and this is why he was also included in the command to the angels to prostrate before Adam. Satan was criticized for defying that command, (. . .)\n\n(So they prostrated themselves except Iblis. He was one of the Jinn;) meaning, his original nature betrayed him. He had been created from smokeless fire, whereas the angels had been created from light, (. . .)\n\nWhen matters crucial every vessel leaks that which to contains and is betrayed by its true nature. Iblis used to do, what the angels did and resembled them in their devotion and worship, so he was included when they were addressed, but he disobeyed and went what he was told to do. So Allah points out here that he was one of the Jinn, he was created from fire, as He says elsewhere.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe common viewpoints about Iblis' affiliation can be summarized as follows:<ref name=\"Dictionary of Islam\">{{cite book|first1=Patrick|last1=Hughes|first2=Thomas Patrick|last2=Hughes|title=Dictionary of Islam|publisher=[[Asian Educational Services]]|location=New Delhi, India|date=1995|ISBN=978-8-120-60672-2|page=135}}</ref>\n* Iblis is from a type of angel, who was created from fire<ref name=\"Vicchio, page 183\"/>\n* Iblis is a genie differing from the angels, who are made out of light.\n* Once an angel, Iblis turned into a genie by his act of disobedience.\nApart from the Quranic narrative, within Islamic exegesis offers two different accounts of Iblis' origin, according to one, he was a noble angel, to the other he was an ignoble jinn, who worked his way up to heaven.<ref>Muhammad Mahmoud. \u201cThe Creation Story in \u2018S\u016brat Al-Baqara,\" with Special Reference to Al-\u1e6cabar\u012b's Material: An Analysis.\u201d Journal of Arabic Literature, vol. 26, no. 1/2, 1995, pp. 201\u2013214.

At the same time, he was the closest to the [[Throne of God]]. God gave him authority over the lower heavens and the earth. Iblis is also considered as the leader of those angels who battled the earthly jinn. Therefore, Iblis and his army drove the jinn to the edge of the world, [[Mount Qaf]]. Knowing about the corruption of the former earthen inhabitants, Iblis protested, when he was instructed to prostrate himself before the new earthen inhabitant, that is Adam. He assumed that the angels who ''praise God's glory day and night'' are superior in contrast to the mud-made human and their bodily flaws.<ref>{{cite book|first=James William|last=Hampson Stobart|title=Islam & Its Founder|series=Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|date=1876|publisher=[[Oxford University]]|location=Oxfordshire, England|page=114}}</ref> He even regarded himself superior in comparison to the other angels, since he was (one of those) created from fire.

Both Western academics and Islamic scholars debated the essence of Iblis.\n\n=== In academic discourse ===\nIn most Surahs, it seems to be implied that Iblis is one of the angels.

Therefore, Iblis would have been created as a rebellious angel.<ref>Basharin, pages 119\u2013138</ref>\n\n=== Among Muslim scholars ===\nAlthough the Quran seems to be clear about Iblis' identification with the jinn in the Quran, scholars in favor for Iblis' angelic origin argue, that the term ''jinni'' with the [[suffix]] ''i'' refers to guardians of ''[[jannah]]'', a sub-category of \"fiery angels\". Although angels in Islam are commonly thought to be created from light, angels, or at least the fiercer among them, are also identified as created from fire. Reason for that might be the phonetical similarity between fire (''nar'') and light (nur) in Islam. Sometimes the term ''nar'' is better understood as ''hot light of the sun'' instead of fire, contrasted by ''nur'' referring to ''cold light of the moon''.<ref>Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02be\u0101n'' Volume 5 Georgetown University, Washington DC p. 118</ref> On the other hand, scholars arguing that the term refers to jinn, and not a category of angels,  tried to explain his stay among the angels. According to a narrative provided by [[Ibn Kathir]], Iblis was once an ordinary jinn on earth, but, due to his piety and constant worship, elevated among the angels. He lived there for thousands of years, until his non-angelic origin was forgotten and only God remembered Iblis' true identity. When God commanded the angels, Iblis, due to his rank among the angels included, to prostrate himself before Adam, Iblis revealed his true nature. By his refusal his true nature betrayed him, leading to his downfall.<ref>{{cite book|first=Muhammad|last=Saed Abdul-Rahman|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir Juz' 1 (Part 1): Al-Fatihah 1 to Al-Baqarah 141 2nd Edition|publisher=MSA Publication Limited|location=London, England|date=2013|ISBN=978-1-861-79826-8|page=136}}</ref> Other scholars, such as [[Hasan of Basra]] and  [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], do not provide an explanation for his abode among the angels, by extension of a special narrative. Instead they argue, Iblis', depicted as the first of jinn, and not as one of many jinn, stay in heaven is self-explanatory, because every creature is created in heaven first. Here, although created in heaven, Iblis is not regarded as an angel, but the equivalent father of the jinn, compared to what Adam is to humanity. Iblis, as the father of the jinn, was cast out of heaven due to his own sin, just as Adam was banished after his corresponding transgression of God's order not to eat from the [[Forbidden fruit|Forbidden Tree]].\n\nThose scholars, who argue against Iblis' angelic origin also refer to his progeny, since angels do not procreate in Islam. [[Tabari]] who defended Iblis' angelic depiction, argues that Iblis did not procreated until he lost his angelic state and became a devil. Therefore, as an angel, Iblis did not procreated. According to some Islamic traditions, Iblis is an asexual entity, just like other angels or a hermaphrodite creature, whose children split from himself, as devils (''[[Shayatin|\u0161ay\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn]]'') do, but not the jinn. Another central argument to determine Iblis essence discusses Iblis' ability to disobey. As angels are seen as servants of God, Iblis' should not be able to disobey. This arguement had been essential for the advocates who reject the identification with Iblis with one of the angels. As a jinni however, Iblis could be given the ability to choose to obey or disobey.<ref>El-Zein, page 46</ref> Scholars who regard Iblis as an angel, do not see Iblis' refusal as an act of sin, to which angels are incappable of, but as a sign of predestination. Therefore, Iblis has been created, differing from his fellow angels, from fire, thus God installed a rebellious nature in him, to endow him with the task to seduce humans, comparable as other angels are endowed with tasks corresponding to their own nature<ref name=\"Awn, page 97\">Awn, page 97</ref> and created for this purpose from fire differing from the other angels.<ref name=\"Awn, page 97\"/> Thus, Iblis is seen as an instrument of God, not as an entity who freely choose to disobey.<ref>Schimmel, page 212</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Ludo|last=Abicht|title=Islam & Europe: Challenges and Opportunities|publisher=[[Leuven University Press]]|location=Leuven, Belgium|date=2008|ISBN=978-9-058-67672-6|page=128}}</ref><ref>Awn, page 86</ref> Other scholars gave explanations why an angel should choose to disobey and explain that Iblis was, as the teacher of angels, more knowledgeable than the others.<ref>Awn, page 50</ref><ref>Abicht, page 128</ref> Angels might be distinguished by their degree of obedience.
