They have been kept from antiquity, and were kept particularly during the [[Renaissance]] and in the nineteenth century. Such books are essentially [[Scrapbooking|scrapbook]]s filled with items of every kind: recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts. Each one is unique to its creator's particular interests but they almost always include passages found in other texts, sometimes accompanied by the compiler's responses. They became significant in [[Early Modern Europe]].\n\n\"Commonplace\" is a [[Calque|translation]] of the [[Latin]] term ''locus communis'' (from Greek ''t\u00f3pos koin\u00f3s'', see [[literary topos]]) which means \"a general or common topic\", such as a statement of proverbial wisdom. In this original sense, commonplace books were collections of such sayings, such as [[John Milton]]'s example. Scholars now understand them to include manuscripts in which an individual collects material which have a common theme, such as ethics, or exploring several themes in one volume. Commonplace books are private collections of information, but they are not [[Diary|diaries]] or\n[[Travel journal#Travelogues|travelogues]].\n\nIn 1685 the \nEnglish Enlightenment philosopher [[John Locke]] wrote a treatise in French on commonplace books, translated into English in 1706 as ''A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books'', \"in which techniques for entering proverbs, quotations, ideas, speeches were formulated. Locke gave specific advice on how to arrange material by subject and category, using such key topics as love, politics, or religion. Commonplace books, it must be stressed, are not journals, which are chronological and introspective.\"<ref>[[Nicholas A.

The practice of keeping a journal such as this was particularly recommended by Stoics such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]], whose own work [[Meditations]] (2nd century AD) was originally a private record of thoughts and quotations. The [[The Pillow Book|Pillow Book]] of [[Sei Sh\u014dnagon|Sei Shonagon]], a courtier in tenth and eleventh century Japan is likewise a private book of anecdote and poetry, daily thoughts and lists. However, none of these includes the wider range of sources usually associated with commonplace books. A number of renaissance scholars kept something resembling a commonplace book - for example [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who described his notebook exactly as a commonplace book is structured: \"A collection without order, drawn from many papers, which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of which they treat.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/turning-the-pages/?id=cb4c06b9-02f4-49af-80ce-540836464a46&type=book|title=Turning the Pages\u2122 - British Library|website=bl.uk|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>\n\n===Zibaldone===\n[[File:Zibaldone di pensieri VI.djvu|thumb|right|''Zibaldone di pensieri'', written by the Italian [[poet]] [[Giacomo Leopardi]]]]\nDuring the course of the fifteenth century, the Italian peninsula was the site of a development of two new forms of book production: the deluxe registry book and the [[zibaldone]] (or hodgepodge book).

And were the process of preparing their works for publication faithfully detailed by distinguished writers, it would appear how large were their indebtedness to their diary and commonplaces. How carefully should we peruse Shakespeare's notes used in compiling his plays\u2014what was his, what another's\u2014showing how these were fashioned into the shapely whole we read, how Milton composed, Montaigne, Goethe: by what happy strokes of thought, flashes of wit, apt figures, fit quotations snatched from vast fields of learning, their rich pages were wrought forth! This were to give the keys of great authorship!\"  Amos Bronson Alcott,'' Table-Talk of A. Bronson Alcott'' (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1877), p.&nbsp;12.\n* [[Virginia Woolf]], mid-20th century: \"[L]et us take down one of those old notebooks which we have all, at one time or another, had a passion for beginning. Most of the pages are blank, it is true; but at the beginning we shall find a certain number very beautifully covered with a strikingly legible hand-writing. Here we have written down the names of great writers in their order of merit; here we have copied out fine passages from the classics; here are lists of books to be read; and here, most interesting of all, lists of books that have actually been read, as the reader testifies with some youthful vanity by a dash of red ink.\"  Virginia Woolf, \"Hours in a Library,\" ''Granite and Rainbow: Essays by Virginia Woolf''  (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1958), p.&nbsp;25.\n* In [[Lemony Snicket]]'s ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' a number of characters including Klaus Baudelaire and the Quagmire triplets keep commonplace books.\n* In [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s ''[[The English Patient]]'', Count Alm\u00e1sy uses his copy of [[Herodotus]]'s ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' as a commonplace book.\n* In [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories, Holmes keeps numerous commonplace books, which he sometimes uses when doing research.
