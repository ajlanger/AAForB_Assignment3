True electronic bulletin board systems arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which first came online on February 16, 1978.  Before long, most major cities had more than one BBS running on [[TRS-80]], [[Apple II]], [[Atari Corporation|Atari]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]], and similar [[personal computer]]s. The IBM PC was introduced in 1981, and subsequent models of both Mac computers and PCs were used throughout the 1980s.  Multiple modems, followed by specialized telecommunication hardware, allowed many users to be online simultaneously. [[Compuserve]], [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] and [[AOL]] were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s.

In a social media context, content or websites that are \"viral\" (or which \"go viral\") are those with a greater likelihood that users will reshare content posted (by another user) to their social network, leading to further sharing. In some cases, posts containing popular content or fast-breaking news have been rapidly shared and reshared by a huge number of users. Many social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content, such as [[Twitter]]'s retweet button, [[Pinterest]]'s pin function, [[Facebook]]'s share option or [[Tumblr]]'s reblog function. [[Business]]es have a particular interest in [[viral marketing]] tactics because a viral campaign can achieve widespread advertising coverage (particularly if the viral reposting itself makes the news) for a fraction of the cost of a traditional marketing campaign, which typically uses printed materials, like newspapers, [[magazine]]s, mailings, and billboards, and television and radio commercials. [[Nonprofit organization]]s and [[activist]]s may have similar interests in posting content on social media sites with the aim of it going viral. A popular component and feature of Twitter is retweeting. Twitter allows other people to keep up with important events, stay connected with their peers, and can contribute in various ways throughout social media.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1106.0346 |title=Entropy-based Classification of 'Retweeting' Activity on Twitter |last=Ghosh |first=Rumi |date=June 2011 |class=cs.SI}}</ref> When certain posts become popular, they start to get [[retweet]]ed over and over again, becoming viral. Hashtags can be used in tweets, and can also be used to take count of how many people have used that hashtag.\n\n=== Bots ===\nSocial media can enable companies to get in the form of greater market share and increased audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Castronovo|first=Cristina|date=2012|title=Social Media in Alternative Marketing Communication Model|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Development & Competitivness|volume=6|pages=117\u2013136}}</ref> [[Internet bot]]s have been developed which facilitate social media marketing.

Similarly, 71% of Americans in this age group now use Instagram and close to half (45%) are Twitter users. However, Facebook remains the primary platform for most Americans. Roughly two-thirds of U.S. adults (68%) now report that they are Facebook users, and roughly three-quarters of those users access Facebook on a daily basis.

In many ways, mainstream [[journalist]]s have maintained an authoritative voice as the storytellers of the American past. Their documentary style narratives, detailed exposes, and their positions in the present make them prime sources for public memory. Specifically, news media journalists have shaped collective memory on nearly every major national event \u2013 from the deaths of social and political figures to the progression of political hopefuls. Journalists provide elaborate descriptions of commemorative events in U.S. history and contemporary popular cultural sensations. Many Americans learn the significance of historical events and political issues through news media, as they are presented on popular news stations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pajala |first1=Mary |year=2012 |title=Television as an Archive of Memory? |journal=Critical Studies in Television |volume=5 |issue=2|pages=133\u2013145 |doi=10.7227/cst.5.2.16}}</ref> However, journalistic influence is growing less important, whereas social networking sites such as [[Facebook]], YouTube and [[Twitter]], provide a constant supply of alternative news sources for users.\n\nAs [[social networking]] becomes more popular among older and younger generations, sites such as Facebook and YouTube, gradually undermine the traditionally authoritative voices of news media. For example, American citizens contest media coverage of various social and political events as they see fit, inserting their voices into the narratives about America's past and present and shaping their own collective memories.<ref>Motti Neiger, Oren Meyers and Eyal Zandberg.

News media coverage of the incident was minimal until social media users made the story recognizable through their constant discussion of the case. Approximately one month after the fatal shooting of [[Trayvon Martin]], its online coverage by everyday Americans garnered national attention from mainstream media journalists, in turn exemplifying [[media activism]]. In some ways, the spread of this tragic event through alternative news sources parallels that of [[Emmitt Till]] \u2013 whose murder by lynching in 1955 became a national story after it was circulated in African-American and Communist newspapers.\n\n===Interpersonal relationships===\n[[File:Social media team.jpeg|thumb|Modern day teenagers interacting]]\nSocial media is used to fulfill perceived social needs, but not all needs can be fulfilled by social media.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Z. |last2=Tchernev |first2=J.

Friendship in these virtual spaces is thoroughly different from real-world friendship. In its traditional sense, friendship is a relationship which, broadly speaking, involves the sharing of mutual interests, reciprocity, trust, and the revelation of intimate details over time and within specific social (and cultural) contexts. Because friendship depends on mutual revelations that are concealed from the rest of the world, it can only flourish within the boundaries of privacy; the idea of public friendship is an oxymoron.\" Rosen also cites Brigham Young University researchers who \"recently surveyed 184 users of social networking sites and found that heavy users 'feel less socially involved with the community around them.'\"\nCritic Nicholas G.

This finding was consistent with other studies that found people with high social comparison orientation make more social comparisons once on social media.\n\nPeople compare their own lives to the lives of their friends through their friends' posts. People are motivated to portray themselves in a way that is appropriate to the situation and serves their best interest. Often the things posted online are the positive aspects of people's lives, making other people question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling.

Depersonalization refers to the emotional detachment from a social media site a user experiences. The three burnout factors can all negatively influence the user's social media continuance.

There has always been a huge debate on the ownership of the content on social media platforms because it is generated by the users and hosted by the company. Added to this is the danger to security of information, which can be leaked to third parties with economic interests in the platform, or parasites who comb the data for their own databases.<ref name=Jones>{{cite web |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall05-papers/facebook.pdf |last1=Jones |first1=Harvey |last2=Soltren |first2=Jos\u00e9 Hiram |title=Facebook: Threats to Privacy |publisher=MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab |year= 2005 |accessdate=2018-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Privacy===\n[[Privacy concerns with social networking services|Privacy]] rights advocates warn users on social media about the collection of their personal data. Some information is captured without the user's knowledge or [[consent]] through electronic tracking and third party applications. Data may also be collected for law enforcement and governmental purposes,<ref name=Auer2001/> by [[social media intelligence]] using [[data mining]] techniques.<ref name=Jones/> Data and information may also be collected for third party use. When information is shared on social media, that information is no longer private. There have been many cases in which young persons especially, share personal information, which can attract predators. It is very important to monitor what you share, and to be aware of who you could potentially be sharing that information with. Teens especially share significantly more information on the internet now than they have in the past. Teens are much more likely to share their personal information, such as email address, phone number, and school names.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |last=Madden |first=Mary |display-authors=etal |date=May 21, 2013 |website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech |access-date=2016-11-29 }}</ref> Studies suggest that teens are not aware of what they are posting and how much of that information can be accessed by third parties.\n\nThere are arguments that \"privacy is dead\" and that with social media growing more and more, some heavy social media users appear to have become quite unconcerned with privacy. Others argue, however, that people are still very concerned about their privacy, but are being ignored by the companies running these social networks, who can sometimes make a profit off of sharing someone's personal information. There is also a disconnect between social media user's words and their actions. Studies suggest that surveys show that people want to keep their lives private, but their actions on social media suggest otherwise. Another factor is ignorance of how accessible social media posts are. Some social media users who have been criticized for inappropriate comments stated that they did not realize that anyone outside their circle of friends would read their post; in fact, on some social media sites, unless a user selects higher privacy settings, their content is shared with a wide audience.\n\nAccording to a 2016 article diving into the topic of sharing privately and the effect social media has on expectations of privacy, \"1.18 billion people will log into their [[Facebook]] accounts, 500 million tweets will be sent, and there will be 95 million photos and videos posted on [[Instagram]]\" in a day. Much of the privacy concerns individuals face stem from their own posts on a form of social network. Users have the choice to share voluntarily, and has been ingrained into society as routine and normative. Social media is a snapshot of our lives; a community we have created on the behaviors of sharing, posting, liking, and communicating. Sharing has become a phenomenon which social media and networks have uprooted and introduced to the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sunday-review/we-want-privacy-but-cant-stop-sharing.html|title=We Want Privacy, but Can't Stop Sharing|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=October 4, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}</ref> The idea of privacy is redundant; once something is posted, its accessibility remains constant even if we select who is potentially able to view it.

Using Facebook in class allows for integration of multimodal content such as student-created photographs and video and URLs to other texts, in a platform that many students are already familiar with. Twitter can be used to enhance communication building and critical thinking and it provides students with an informal \"[[back channel]]\"), and extend discussion outside of class time.\n\n===Censorship by governments===\n{{Main|Internet censorship}}\n[[File:Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg|thumb|Banner in [[Bangkok]], observed on June 30, 2014, informing the Thai public that 'like' or 'share' activity on social media may land them in jail]]\n\nSocial media often features in political struggles to control public perception and online activity. In some countries, [[Internet police]] or [[secret police]] monitor or control citizens' use of social media. For example, in 2013 some social media was banned in [[Turkey]] after the Taksim [[Gezi Park protests]]. Both Twitter and YouTube were temporarily suspended in the country by a court's decision. A new law, passed by [[Turkish Parliament]], has granted immunity to Telecommunications Directorate (T\u0130B) personnel. The T\u0130B was also given the authority to block access to specific websites without the need for a court order.<ref>{{cite web|author=Salih Sar\u0131kaya |title=Social Media Ban In Turkey: What Does It Mean? by Salih Sar\u0131kaya |url=http://www.salihsarikaya.com/en/social-media-ban-in-turkey-what-does-it-mean-by-salih-sarikaya/ |date=October 30, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006012638/http://www.salihsarikaya.com/en/social-media-ban-in-turkey-what-does-it-mean-by-salih-sarikaya/ |archivedate=2014-10-06 }}</ref> Yet T\u0130B's 2014 blocking of Twitter was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-twitter-ban-idUSBREA311BF20140402 |title=Turkey's Twitter ban violates free speech: constitutional court |work=Reuters |date=April 2, 2014 }}</ref> More recently, in the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat]], the public was explicitly instructed not to 'share' or 'like' dissenting views on social media or face prison.

Rather than \"deplatforming\", such standards would allow a more scalable, and customizable approach to content moderation and censorship, and involve a number of companies, more like e-mail servers work today. [[Mastodon (software)|Mastodon]] currently operates via a federation of volunteer-operated servers that connect with each other through the open source protocol [[ActivityPub]]. In early 2019, Mastodon successfully blocked the spread of violent right-wing extremism when the Twitter alternative [[Gab (social network)|Gab]] tried to associate with Mastodon, and their independent servers quickly contained its dissemination.<ref>Kan, M.

How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and Facebook,\u201d the media plays a large role in shaping people's perceptions of specific social networking sites. When looking at the site [[Myspace|MySpace]], after adults started to realize how popular the sight was becoming with teens, news media became heavily concerned with teen participation and the potential dangers they faced using the site. As a result, teens avoided joining the site because of the associated risks (e.g. child predators and lack of control) and parents began to publicly denounce the site. Ultimately, the site was labeled as dangerous, and many were detracted from interacting with the site. As boyd also describes, when [[Facebook]] initially launched in 2004, it solely targeted college students and access was intentionally limited. Facebook started as a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-only social networking site before expanding to all other [[Ivy League]] schools. It then made its way to other top universities and ultimately to a wider range of schools. Because of its origins, some saw Facebook as an \u201celite\u201d social networking site. While it was very open and accepting to some, it seemed to outlaw and shun out most others who didn't fit that \u201celite\u201d categorization. These narratives propagated by the media influenced the large movement of teenage users from one social networking site to another.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race After the Internet|last=boyd|first=danah|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Nakamura|editor-first=Lisa|location=|pages=203\u2013222|chapter=White Flight in Networked Publics?

True electronic bulletin board systems arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which first came online on February 16, 1978.  Before long, most major cities had more than one BBS running on [[TRS-80]], [[Apple II]], [[Atari Corporation|Atari]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]], and similar [[personal computer]]s. The IBM PC was introduced in 1981, and subsequent models of both Mac computers and PCs were used throughout the 1980s.  Multiple modems, followed by specialized telecommunication hardware, allowed many users to be online simultaneously. [[Compuserve]], [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] and [[AOL]] were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s.

According to [[Andreas Kaplan]], mobile social media applications can be differentiated among four types:<ref name='mobileKaplan' />\n\n# ''Space-timers'' (location and time sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance mostly for one specific location at one specific point in time (e.g. [[Facebook Places]] [[WhatsApp]]; [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]])\n# ''Space-locators'' (only location sensitive): Exchange of messages, with relevance for one specific location, which is tagged to a certain place and read later by others (e.g. [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]]; [[Qype]], [[Tumblr]], [[Fishbrain]])\n# ''Quick-timers'' (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media [[mobile apps]] to increase immediacy (e.g. posting [[Twitter]] messages or [[Facebook]] status updates)\n# ''Slow-timers'' (neither location nor time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to [[mobile devices]] (e.g. watching a [[YouTube]] video or reading/editing a [[Wikipedia]] article)\n\n==Elements and function==\n\n===Viral content===\nSome social media sites have potential for content posted there to spread ''[[Viral phenomenon|virally]]'' over social networks. The term is an analogy to the concept of [[viral infections]], which can spread rapidly from person to person. In a social media context, content or websites that are \"viral\" (or which \"go viral\") are those with a greater likelihood that users will reshare content posted (by another user) to their social network, leading to further sharing. In some cases, posts containing popular content or fast-breaking news have been rapidly shared and reshared by a huge number of users. Many social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content, such as [[Twitter]]'s retweet button, [[Pinterest]]'s pin function, [[Facebook]]'s share option or [[Tumblr]]'s reblog function. [[Business]]es have a particular interest in [[viral marketing]] tactics because a viral campaign can achieve widespread advertising coverage (particularly if the viral reposting itself makes the news) for a fraction of the cost of a traditional marketing campaign, which typically uses printed materials, like newspapers, [[magazine]]s, mailings, and billboards, and television and radio commercials. [[Nonprofit organization]]s and [[activist]]s may have similar interests in posting content on social media sites with the aim of it going viral. A popular component and feature of Twitter is retweeting. Twitter allows other people to keep up with important events, stay connected with their peers, and can contribute in various ways throughout social media.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1106.0346 |title=Entropy-based Classification of 'Retweeting' Activity on Twitter |last=Ghosh |first=Rumi |date=June 2011 |class=cs.SI}}</ref> When certain posts become popular, they start to get [[retweet]]ed over and over again, becoming viral. Hashtags can be used in tweets, and can also be used to take count of how many people have used that hashtag.\n\n=== Bots ===\nSocial media can enable companies to get in the form of greater market share and increased audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Castronovo|first=Cristina|date=2012|title=Social Media in Alternative Marketing Communication Model|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Development & Competitivness|volume=6|pages=117\u2013136}}</ref> [[Internet bot]]s have been developed which facilitate social media marketing.

In many ways, mainstream [[journalist]]s have maintained an authoritative voice as the storytellers of the American past. Their documentary style narratives, detailed exposes, and their positions in the present make them prime sources for public memory. Specifically, news media journalists have shaped collective memory on nearly every major national event \u2013 from the deaths of social and political figures to the progression of political hopefuls. Journalists provide elaborate descriptions of commemorative events in U.S. history and contemporary popular cultural sensations. Many Americans learn the significance of historical events and political issues through news media, as they are presented on popular news stations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pajala |first1=Mary |year=2012 |title=Television as an Archive of Memory? |journal=Critical Studies in Television |volume=5 |issue=2|pages=133\u2013145 |doi=10.7227/cst.5.2.16}}</ref> However, journalistic influence is growing less important, whereas social networking sites such as [[Facebook]], YouTube and [[Twitter]], provide a constant supply of alternative news sources for users.\n\nAs [[social networking]] becomes more popular among older and younger generations, sites such as Facebook and YouTube, gradually undermine the traditionally authoritative voices of news media.

In contrast girls generally post more images that include themselves, friends and things they have emotional ties to, which the researchers attributed that to the higher emotional intelligence of girls at a younger age. The authors sampled over 632 girls and boys from the ages of 12\u201316 from Spain in an effort to confirm their beliefs. The researchers concluded that masculinity is more commonly associated with a positive psychological well-being, while femininity displays less psychological well-being.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Facebook Involvement, Objectified Body Consciousness, Body Shame, and Sexual Assertiveness in College Women and Men |journal=Sex Roles |volume=72 |issue=1\u20132 |doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0441-1 |year=2014 |pages=1\u201314 | last1 = Manago | first1 = Adriana M. | last2 = Ward | first2 = L.

Users of Facebook generally use their profile to reflect that they are a \"normal\" person. Social media was found to uphold gender stereotypes both feminine and masculine. The researchers also noted that the traditional stereotypes are often upheld by boys more so than girls. The authors described how neither stereotype was entirely positive, but most people viewed masculine values as more positive.\n\n===Cognition and memory===\nAccording to writer Christine Rosen in \"Virtual Friendship, and the New Narcissism,\" many social media sites encourage status-seeking.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/virtual-friendship-and-the-new-narcissism |title=Virtual Friendship and the New Narcissism |work=The New Atlantis |accessdate=2016-02-29 |author=Rosen, Christine}}</ref> According to Rosen, the practice and definition of \"friendship\" changes in virtuality. Friendship in these virtual spaces is thoroughly different from real-world friendship. In its traditional sense, friendship is a relationship which, broadly speaking, involves the sharing of mutual interests, reciprocity, trust, and the revelation of intimate details over time and within specific social (and cultural) contexts. Because friendship depends on mutual revelations that are concealed from the rest of the world, it can only flourish within the boundaries of privacy; the idea of public friendship is an oxymoron.\" Rosen also cites Brigham Young University researchers who \"recently surveyed 184 users of social networking sites and found that heavy users 'feel less socially involved with the community around them.'\"\nCritic Nicholas G.

Some users have experienced threats of violence online and have feared these threats manifesting themselves offline. At the same time, concerns have been raised about possible links between heavy social media use and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and even the issues of [[cyberbullying]], online [[harassment]] and \"[[Internet troll|trolling]]\".

This finding was consistent with other studies that found people with high social comparison orientation make more social comparisons once on social media.\n\nPeople compare their own lives to the lives of their friends through their friends' posts. People are motivated to portray themselves in a way that is appropriate to the situation and serves their best interest. Often the things posted online are the positive aspects of people's lives, making other people question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling. This can lead to depression and other self-esteem issues as well as decrease their satisfaction of life as they feel if their life is not exciting enough to put online it is not as good as their friends or family.<ref>Hawi, N.S. & Samaha, M. 2017, \"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nazir_Hawi/publication/306048463_The_Relations_Among_Social_Media_Addiction_Self-Esteem_and_Life_Satisfaction_in_University_Students/links/59efa4b6a6fdcce2096dc335/The-Relations-Among-Social-Media-Addiction-Self-Esteem-and-Life-Satisfaction-in-University-Students.pdf The Relations Among Social Media Addiction, Self-Esteem, and Life Satisfaction in University Students]\", Social Science Computer Review, vol. 35, no. 5, pp. 576-586</ref>\n\nStudies have shown that self comparison on social media can have dire effects on physical and mental health because they give us the ability to seek approval and compare ourselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Stefanone, M.A. |author2=Lackaff, D. |author3=Rosen, D. |date=2011 |title=Contingencies of Self-Worth and Social-Networking-Site Behavior |url=http://www.buffalo.edu/content/dam/cas/communication/files/Stefanone/Stefanone_cyberpsych.2011.pdf |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=14 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=41\u20139 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2010.0049 |pmid=21329442 }}</ref> Social media has both a practical usage- to connect us with others, but also can lead to fulfillment of gratification.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Quan-Haase |first=Anabel |last2=Young |first2=Alyson L.|date=September 14, 2010|title=Uses and Gratifications of Social Media: A Comparison of Facebook and Instant Messaging |journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society |language=en |volume=30|issue=5|pages=350\u2013361 |doi=10.1177/0270467610380009|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8423ac0b397329ad53605d1e8e1cdd5f9b4cade8 }}</ref> In fact, one study suggests that because a critical aspect of social networking sites involve spending hours, if not months customizing a personal profile, and encourage a sort of social currency based on likes, followers and comments- they provide a forum for persistent \"appearance conversations\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/children-teens-media-and-body-image# |title=Children, Teens, Media, and Body Image |website=Common Sense Media|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}</ref> These appearance centered conversations that forums like Facebook, Instagram among others provide can lead to feelings of disappointment in looks and personality when not enough likes or comments are achieved.

Ambivalence refers to a user's confusion about the benefits she can get from using a social media site. Emotional exhaustion refers to the stress a user has when using a social media site. Depersonalization refers to the emotional detachment from a social media site a user experiences. The three burnout factors can all negatively influence the user's social media continuance. This study provides an instrument to measure the burnout a user can experience, when his or her social media \"friends\" are generating an overwhelming amount of useless information (e.g., \"what I had for dinner\", \"where I am now\").\n\n====Adolescents====\nExcessive use of digital technology, like social media, by adolescents can cause disruptions in their physical and mental health, in sleeping patterns, their weight and levels of exercise and notably in their academic performance. Research has continued to demonstrate that long hours spent on mobile devices have shown a positive relationship with an increase in teenagers' BMI and a lack of physical activity. Moreover, excessive internet usage has been linked to lower grades compared to users who do not spend an excessive amount of time online, even with a control over age, gender, race, parent education and personal contentment factors that may affect the study.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s11920-014-0472-x|pmid = 25070673|title = Adolescents and the Internet: What Mental Health Clinicians Need to Know|journal = Current Psychiatry Reports|volume = 16|issue = 9|pages = 472|year = 2014|last1 = Rafla|first1 = Malak|last2 = Carson|first2 = Nicholas J|last3 = Dejong|first3 = Sandra M}}</ref>  In a recent study, it was found that time spent on Facebook has a strong negative relationship with overall GPA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Junco|first=Reynol|date=September 2011|title=Too Much Face and Not Enough Books|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211001932|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=28|pages=|via=}}</ref> The use of multiple social media platforms is more strongly associated with depression and anxiety among young adults than time spent online.

With the introduction of social media platforms such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]], the hashtag was created to easily organize and search for information. Hashtags can be used when people want to advocate for a movement, store content or tweets from a movement for future use, and allow other social media users to contribute to a discussion about a certain movement by using existing hashtags.

Activism and especially high-risk activism involves strong-tie relationships, hierarchies, coordination, motivation, exposing oneself to high risks, making sacrifices.<ref name=\"Gladwell 2010-10-04\"/> Gladwell discusses that social media are built around weak ties and he argues that \"social networks are effective at increasing participation \u2014 by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires\".<ref name=\"Gladwell 2010-10-04\"/> According to him \"Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice, but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice\".<ref name=\"Gladwell 2010-10-04\"/>\n\nDisputing Gladwell's theory, in the study \"Perceptions of Social Media for Politics: Testing the Slacktivism Hypothesis,\" Kwak and colleagues conducted a survey which found that people who are politically expressive on social media are also more likely to participate in offline political activity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kwak|first=Nojin|last2=Lane|first2=Daniel S|last3=Weeks|first3=Brian E|last4=Kim|first4=Dam Hee|last5=Lee|first5=Slgi S|last6=Bachleda|first6=Sarah|date=April 1, 2018|title=Perceptions of Social Media for Politics: Testing the Slacktivism Hypothesis|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=44|issue=2|pages=197\u2013221|doi=10.1093/hcr/hqx008|issn=0360-3989}}</ref>\n\n===Ownership of content===\nSocial media content is generated through social media interactions done by the users through the site. There has always been a huge debate on the ownership of the content on social media platforms because it is generated by the users and hosted by the company. Added to this is the danger to security of information, which can be leaked to third parties with economic interests in the platform, or parasites who comb the data for their own databases.<ref name=Jones>{{cite web |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall05-papers/facebook.pdf |last1=Jones |first1=Harvey |last2=Soltren |first2=Jos\u00e9 Hiram |title=Facebook: Threats to Privacy |publisher=MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab |year= 2005 |accessdate=2018-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Privacy===\n[[Privacy concerns with social networking services|Privacy]] rights advocates warn users on social media about the collection of their personal data. Some information is captured without the user's knowledge or [[consent]] through electronic tracking and third party applications. Data may also be collected for law enforcement and governmental purposes,<ref name=Auer2001/> by [[social media intelligence]] using [[data mining]] techniques.<ref name=Jones/> Data and information may also be collected for third party use. When information is shared on social media, that information is no longer private. There have been many cases in which young persons especially, share personal information, which can attract predators. It is very important to monitor what you share, and to be aware of who you could potentially be sharing that information with. Teens especially share significantly more information on the internet now than they have in the past. Teens are much more likely to share their personal information, such as email address, phone number, and school names.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |last=Madden |first=Mary |display-authors=etal |date=May 21, 2013 |website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech |access-date=2016-11-29 }}</ref> Studies suggest that teens are not aware of what they are posting and how much of that information can be accessed by third parties.\n\nThere are arguments that \"privacy is dead\" and that with social media growing more and more, some heavy social media users appear to have become quite unconcerned with privacy. Others argue, however, that people are still very concerned about their privacy, but are being ignored by the companies running these social networks, who can sometimes make a profit off of sharing someone's personal information. There is also a disconnect between social media user's words and their actions. Studies suggest that surveys show that people want to keep their lives private, but their actions on social media suggest otherwise. Another factor is ignorance of how accessible social media posts are. Some social media users who have been criticized for inappropriate comments stated that they did not realize that anyone outside their circle of friends would read their post; in fact, on some social media sites, unless a user selects higher privacy settings, their content is shared with a wide audience.\n\nAccording to a 2016 article diving into the topic of sharing privately and the effect social media has on expectations of privacy, \"1.18 billion people will log into their [[Facebook]] accounts, 500 million tweets will be sent, and there will be 95 million photos and videos posted on [[Instagram]]\" in a day. Much of the privacy concerns individuals face stem from their own posts on a form of social network. Users have the choice to share voluntarily, and has been ingrained into society as routine and normative. Social media is a snapshot of our lives; a community we have created on the behaviors of sharing, posting, liking, and communicating. Sharing has become a phenomenon which social media and networks have uprooted and introduced to the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sunday-review/we-want-privacy-but-cant-stop-sharing.html|title=We Want Privacy, but Can't Stop Sharing|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=October 4, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}</ref> The idea of privacy is redundant; once something is posted, its accessibility remains constant even if we select who is potentially able to view it.

One German study, published in 2017, investigated a correlation between extensive use of the social networking site and narcissism; the results were published in the journal PLoS One.

As result, cell phones have been banned from some classrooms, and some schools have blocked many popular social media websites. Many schools have realized that they need to loosen restrictions, teach digital citizenship skills, and even incorporate these tools into classrooms. Some schools permit students to use [[smartphone]]s or [[tablet computer]]s in class, as long as the students are using these devices for academic purposes, such as doing research. Using Facebook in class allows for integration of multimodal content such as student-created photographs and video and URLs to other texts, in a platform that many students are already familiar with. Twitter can be used to enhance communication building and critical thinking and it provides students with an informal \"[[back channel]]\"), and extend discussion outside of class time.\n\n===Censorship by governments===\n{{Main|Internet censorship}}\n[[File:Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg|thumb|Banner in [[Bangkok]], observed on June 30, 2014, informing the Thai public that 'like' or 'share' activity on social media may land them in jail]]\n\nSocial media often features in political struggles to control public perception and online activity.

For example, in 2013 some social media was banned in [[Turkey]] after the Taksim [[Gezi Park protests]]. Both Twitter and YouTube were temporarily suspended in the country by a court's decision.

How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and Facebook,\u201d the media plays a large role in shaping people's perceptions of specific social networking sites. When looking at the site [[Myspace|MySpace]], after adults started to realize how popular the sight was becoming with teens, news media became heavily concerned with teen participation and the potential dangers they faced using the site. As a result, teens avoided joining the site because of the associated risks (e.g. child predators and lack of control) and parents began to publicly denounce the site. Ultimately, the site was labeled as dangerous, and many were detracted from interacting with the site. As boyd also describes, when [[Facebook]] initially launched in 2004, it solely targeted college students and access was intentionally limited. Facebook started as a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-only social networking site before expanding to all other [[Ivy League]] schools. It then made its way to other top universities and ultimately to a wider range of schools. Because of its origins, some saw Facebook as an \u201celite\u201d social networking site. While it was very open and accepting to some, it seemed to outlaw and shun out most others who didn't fit that \u201celite\u201d categorization. These narratives propagated by the media influenced the large movement of teenage users from one social networking site to another.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race After the Internet|last=boyd|first=danah|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Nakamura|editor-first=Lisa|location=|pages=203\u2013222|chapter=White Flight in Networked Publics?
