{"title_page": "Jewish deicide", "text_new": "{{short description|Belief that Jews bear collective guilt for the crucifixion of Jesus}}\n \n{{Antisemitism}}\n'''Jewish deicide''' is the historical fact held by [[Christians]] that the [[Jewish people]] were responsible for the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death of Jesus]]. The Romans executed Jesus, however, many Jewish Priests and Pharisees who represented the Jews as a whole demanded it, for the following reasons:\n\n1. Jesus called God \u2018his father\u2019. The Jews could never accept it. In the Old Testament we see God himself reveal Him as \u201cYahweh\u201d. But the Jews never pronounced this word due to respect and fear. Instead they used words equivalent to \u2018the creator\u2019, \u2018the one who live in heaven\u2019 etc. And now here is Jesus who call God as \u2018my father\u2019. Jews saw it as a heresy deserving death.\n\n2. Jesus claimed he is God and one with Father. The Jewish priests could never digest this as they always believed in \u2018One God\u2019. This claim was sufficient for them to kill Jesus.\n\n3. The priests and Pharisees at the time of Jesus was searching for their own comfort and treated normal citizens with contempt. Jesus criticized their stand. (Mark 12: 28\u201340) [And in his teaching he said, \u201cBeware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, who devour widows\u2019 houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u201d]\n\n4. Jesus reacted to injustice and systems set to loot the believers. (Mark 11: 15\u201319) [And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. And he was teaching them and saying to them, \u201cIs it not written, \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations\u2019? But you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching. And when evening came they went out of the city. ]\n\n5. Many a times the Pharisees tried to trap Jesus and charge him for being not loyal to the Roman Empire. But Jesus did not fall into those traps. (Mark 12: 13\u201317) [And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to trap him in his talk. And they came and said to him, \u201cTeacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone\u2019s opinion. For you are not swayed by appearances,c (http://biblehub.com/esv/mark/12.htm#footnotes) but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?\u201d But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, \u201cWhy put me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.\u201d And they brought one. And he said to them, \u201cWhose likeness and inscription is this?\u201d They said to him, \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cRender to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s, and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d And they marveled at him.]\n\n6. Then they directly challenged the authority of Jesus. ((Mark 11: 27\u201333) [And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him, and they said to him, \u201cBy what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cI will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man? Answer me.\u201d And they discussed it with one another, saying, \u201cIf we say, \u2018From heaven,\u2019 he will say, \u2018Why then did you not believe him?\u2019 But shall we say, \u2018From man\u2019?\u201d\u2014they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John really was a prophet. So they answered Jesus, \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And Jesus said to them, \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d]\n\n7. See how they were disturbed by Jesus. (John 12: 9\u201311) \u201cWhen the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well, because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.\u201d\n\n8. The Jewish priests and pharisees were planning to kill Jesus all along. (Mark 3: 1\u20136) \u201cAgain he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand. And they watched Jesus, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him. And he said to the man with the withered hand, \u201cCome here.\u201d And he said to them, \u201cIs it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?\u201d But they were silent. And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.\u201d\n\n9. Here is another background and see how they plot to kill Jesus. (John 11: 45\u201353) [Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him, but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council and said, \u201cWhat are we to do? For this man performs many signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.\u201d But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, \u201cYou know nothing at all. Nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish.\u201d He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, and not for the nation only, but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. So from that day on they made plans to put him to death.]\nSo Jesus was killed by executing the plan of the Jewish Priests and Pharisees. Involvement of general public or common Jews were almost nil as they were mostly benefited by the work of Jesus. They accepted him as a prophet and believed in him.\n\n==Source of deicide charge==\n===New Testament===\nJustification of the charge of Jewish deicide has been sought in {{bibleref2|Matthew|27:24\u201325|RSV}}:\n{{quote|So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, \"I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves.\" And all the people answered, \"His blood be on us and on our children!\"}}\n\nThe verse that reads: \"And all the people answered, 'His blood be on us and on our children!{{'\"}} is also referred to as the [[blood curse]]. In an essay regarding antisemitism, biblical scholar [[Amy-Jill Levine]] argues that this passage has caused more Jewish suffering throughout history than any other in the New Testament.<ref name=\"FredriksenReinhartz2002\">{{cite book|author1=Fredriksen, Paula|author2=Reinhartz, Adele|title=Jesus, Judaism, and Christian Anti-Judaism: Reading the New Testament After the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6glHmK_rZYUC&pg=PA91|year=2002|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22328-1|page=91}}</ref>\n\nMany also point to the Gospel of John as evidence of Christian charges of deicide. As Samuel Sandmel writes, \"John is widely regarded as either the most anti-Semitic or at least the most overtly anti-Semitic of the gospels.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=William O.|date=1979|title=Anti-Semitism in the New Testament?

In his defense Jesus said to them, \"My father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.\" For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</blockquote>Some scholars describe this passage as irrefutably referencing and implicating the Jews in deicide, although many such as scholar Robert Kysar also argue that part of the severity of this charge comes more from those who read and understand the text than the text itself. For instance, John renders the character of the ''Ioudaioi'', the Jew, as a clear antagonist and Christ-killer, although the notion that the Jew is meant to in fact represent all Jews is often disputed.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kysar, Robert.|title=Voyages with John : charting the Fourth Gospel|date=2005|publisher=Baylor University Press|isbn=1-932792-43-0|oclc=62324647}}</ref> While the New Testament is often more subtle or leveled in accusations of deicide, many scholars hold that these works cannot be held in isolation, and must be considered in the context of their interpretation by later Christian communities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Louis H.|last2=Evans|first2=Craig A.|last3=Hagner|first3=Donald A.|date=January 1995|title=Anti-Semitism and Early Christianity: Issues of Polemic and Faith|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=115|issue=1|pages=115|doi=10.2307/605317|jstor=605317|issn=0003-0279}}</ref> \n\nAccording to Jeremy Cohen:\n{{quote|Even before the Gospels appeared, the apostle Paul (or, more probably, one of his disciples) portrayed the Jews as Christ's killers ...
