His first lap split time was 59 seconds, his second lap 2:00. After three laps, he was at 3:07. He started to fall off his pace as he finished the race, but he nevertheless set a new amateur record of 4:17{{frac|4|5}}. ([[Walter George (athlete)|Walter George]] had run 4:12\u00be in 1886 as a professional.)\n\nThat record lasted to 1895 as [[Fred Bacon|Frederick Bacon]] ran 4:17 at the [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]] Championships at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], [[London]] on 6 July.\n\nConneff wanted to regain his record, so after a 4:21 tune-up on 10 August at [[Weehawken]], [[New Jersey]], he ran a 3/4 mile race at [[Travers Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on 21 August in 3:02{{frac|4|5}}, a time which would not be bettered for 36 years.\n\nReturning to Travers Island a week later, Conneff was paced by 4:21{{frac|1|5}} miler George Orton, who led him to the quarter in 62{{frac|2|5}} and the half in 2:06{{frac|3|5}}. At the 3/4 mark, Conneff was at 3:10{{frac|4|5}}. Two-time AAU champion Eddie Carter paced Conneff for the last 300 yards as Conneff started to slow. He crossed the finish line and stopped the clock at 4:15{{frac|3|5}} to regain his amateur mile record.\n\nHe followed that record run on 21 September with a race against some of the top British runners. He ran a first-lap 65, then was at 2:10{{frac|3|5}} at the half, again paced by Orton. William Lutyens, who had run a 4:19{{frac|4|5}} the year before and had paced Bacon to his record, was forced to drop out of the race, leaving Conneff to trot home in 4:18{{frac|1|5}}.\n\nReporter William B. Curtis described Conneff after the race: \"He never was in such fine mettle as during the past four weeks. He could at any time have beaten his own world's best amateur record of 4:15{{frac|3|5}} and might have equalled or surpassed the world's best professional record, 4:12\u00be... He is one of those athletes who speedily makes their handlers go gray-haired, is restive under the restrictions of training, and prone to stray outside the bounds laid down for athletic aspirants. He is now 29 years old and can hardly hope to improve hereafter.\"\n\nHis amateur mile record would stand until 1911.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Cordner Nelson and Roberto Quercetani, ''The Milers'', Tafnews Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-911521-15-1}}, pp.&nbsp;11\u201312\n\n{{Footer US NC 1500m Men}}\n{{Footer US NC 10000m Men}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conneff, Thomas}}\n[[Category:1860s births]]\n[[Category:1912 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:American male middle-distance runners]]\n[[Category:World record setters in athletics (track and field)]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:Irish male middle-distance runners]]\n[[Category:Irish emigrants to the United States (before 1923)]]\n", "text_old": "'''Thomas Conneff''' (ca. 1866\u20131910) was an amateur Irish runner who held the [[World record progression for the mile run|amateur record for the fastest mile]] (4:15{{frac|3|5}}) from 1895 to 1911.\n\nThomas \"Tommy\" Conneff was born in Kilmurray, Clane Co.
