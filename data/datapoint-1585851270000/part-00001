{"title_page": "Old Latium", "text_new": "{{Refimprove\n| date = April 2017\n}}[[File:Ligue-latine-carte.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Latium with the cities of the Latin League]]\n'''Old Latium''' ({{lang-la|Latium vetus}} or ''{{lang|la|Latium antiquum}}'') is a region of the [[Italian peninsula]] bounded to the north by the [[river Tiber]], to the east by the central [[Apennine mountains]], to the west by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and to the south by [[Monte Circeo]]. It was the territory of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], an [[Italic tribe]] which included the early inhabitants of the city of [[Rome]]. Later it was also settled by various Italic tribes such as the [[Rutulians]], [[Volscians]], [[Aequi]], and [[Hernici]].<ref>Strabon ''Geography'' III 10.</ref> The region was referred to as \"old\" to distinguish it from the expanded region, [[Latium]], that included the region to the south of Old Latium, between [[Mount Circeo|Monte Circeo]] and the river [[Garigliano]] \u2013 the so-called [[Latium adiectum]] (\"attached Latium\"). It corresponded to the central part of the modern administrative region of [[Lazio]], [[Italy]], and it covered an area measuring of roughly 50 [[Roman miles]].<ref>Pliny ''NH'' III 56.</ref> It was calculated by [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] that the region's area was about 1860 square kilometres.<ref>T. Mommsen ''History of Rome'' I 3, 3.</ref>\n\n==Settlement==\n====Literary tradition====\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] has preserved extensive information on the settlement of Latium in his book, ''<nowiki/>'Roman Antiquities''<nowiki/>', where he listed and discussed many legends and traditional stories related by historians and scholars, both Greek and Roman, on how Latium was settled. [[Pliny the Elder]] also wrote about Old Latium. In his book '''[[Naturalis Historia|Natural History]]''<nowiki/>', he lists two settlements in Old Latium that at the time of writing had disappeared. Other important literary sources include [[Livy]], [[Strabo]], [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], and [[Servius Danielis]].\n\nAccording to these sources Latium was first settled long ago by [[Sicels]] and [[Ligures]],<ref>Festus s. v.  ''sacrani'' p. 424 L: \"''Sacrani'' are named those who moved from Reate and expelled the Sicels and Ligures from the ''Septimontium''\"; Servius Danielis ''Ad Aeneidem'' XI 371, VIII ; Dionysius of  Halicarnassus ''RA'' I  12, 2 citing  Sophocles's ''Triptolemus'' on Oenotrians and Ligures settling the coasts of the Tyrrhenian Sea.</ref> but many sources contradict or do not state which of the two groups first settled Latium. According to the literary tradition, the Sicels and Ligures were forced out of Latium by the constant pressure exerted by the [[Aborigines (mythology)|Aborigines]], who dwelt in [[Reate]], causing the Ligures to migrate to [[Liguria]] and the Sicels to [[Sicily]]. The migration of the tribes appears to have been from the hills and mountains of the region down towards the plains, although there are testimonies of Greek colonizers migrating by sea into the region, as in the legend of [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]], and to southern Italy, as the Sicels were considered to be both [[Oenotrians]] of Greek origin,<ref>Dionysius of Hal. ''RA''  I 12, 3.</ref> and [[Rutulians|Rutulian]] of [[Dauni|Daunian]] origin.\n\nThe arrival of the [[Aeneads]] and the founding of [[Lavinium]] are claimed to mark the beginning of civilization in Latium<ref>http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2007.01.0058</ref>, and 30 years after these events [[Alba Longa|Alba]] was founded, the city that led the [[Latin League]], a coalition of 30 cities and tribes that lasted for 500 years. While there are many different myths on the founding of these cities, it is known that the region and the Latin League were religiously influenced by the cult of Iuppiter Latiaris,  an [[Epithets of Jupiter|epithet of Jupiter]], and venerated this god as the high protector of the league.\n\n====Pliny's list====\nThe accounting provided by Pliny the Elder does not include all the centres of Latium Vetus that later developed into towns, but rather lists those which, according to the scholar, had disappeared by his time without leaving any trace. Therefore, he does not mention [[Anxur]], [[Tibur]], [[Cora (Ancient Latin town)|Cora]], [[Ficulea]], [[Nomentum]], [[Praeneste]], [[Gabii]], [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]], [[Ariccia|Aricia]], [[Tusculum]], [[Lavinium]], [[Laurentum]], [[Lanuvium]], [[Labicum]], and [[Velitrae]], which were still standing, with the exception of old Labicum. But some settlements he mentions were in fact visited by Strabo only seventy years earlier (such as [[Tellenae]]), and some still certainly stood in his own time, such as [[Pedum]]. Another oddity of the passage is that while he claims there were fifty-three centres that had disappeared, his list numbers only fifty. Even though elsewhere he mentions two other sites, [[Apiolae]] and [[Amyclae (Italy)|Amyclae]], this still does not equal fifty-three. The list is in book III of his ''Natural History'' ch. 68 and 69:\n\n\"In the first region moreover in Latium were the famous walled towns (''clara oppida'') [[Satricum]], Scaptia, [[Politorium]], [[Tellena]], [[Tifata]], [[Caenina (town)|Caenina]], [[Ficana]], [[Crustumeria]], [[Ameriola]], [[Medullum]], [[Corniculum]], Saturnia now which is Rome, Antipolis (which is now the [[Janiculum]], a place in Rome), [[Antemnae]], [[Cameria|Camerium]], [[Collatia]], [[Amitinum]], [[Norba]], and [[Sulmo]]. Together with them the Alban Peoples who use to receive the (sacrificial) meat on the Alban Mount: Albani, Aesolani, Accienses, Abolani, Bubetani, Bolani, Cusuetani, Coriolani, Fidenates, Foreti, Hortenses, Latinienses, Longani, Manates, Macrales, Munienses, Numinienses, Olliculani, Octulani, Pedani, Poletaurini, Querquetulani, Sicani, Sisolenses, Tolerienses, Tutienses, Vimitellari, Velienses, Venetulani, Vitellienses.\"\n\nThe list is apparently made up of two sections, the first is referred to as ''clara oppida'' and the second as ''populi Albenses''. The last two towns mentioned among the ''clara oppida'', Norba and Sulmo, were in fact within Latium Adiectum. They were destroyed in the 1st{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BC during the war between Marius and Sulla.\n\nThe second section gives the names of the ''populi Albenses''. These were local communities inhabiting the region of ''Mons Albanus'' (now Monte Cavo) and its immediate surroundings, the Alban Hills. Only some of them seem to have reached the urban stage and the list reflects the typical archaic [[Bronze Age]] organization of  human settlement: sparse, polycentric and gravitating around a religious centre, in this case the sanctuary of ''Iuppiter Latiaris''. The exact location of these settlements is unknown with a few exceptions: Aesulae, Pedum,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Fidenae, Politorium, Bovillae, and Tolerium. It is possible that the Latinienses were settlers of the Ager Latiniensis, i. e. the area near Laurentum and Lavinium,<ref>Cf. Cicero ''De Haruspicum Responso'': a crack sound was heard in the  Ager Latiniensis.</ref> and that the Foreti were actually settlers of the area later occupied by the Roman Forum. The Querquetulani, however, were certainly not the settlers of the Querquetulan (i.e. Caelian ) Hill in Rome as they are mentioned by Dionysius in the list of Latin peoples who went to war against Rome in 495.\n\n====Dionysius's list====\nDionysius gives a list of the towns members  of the Latin League that voted for war against Rome after the capture of Fidenae by the Romans, under the influence of Aricia and of former king Tarquinius the Proud at an assembly held at Ferentinum:<ref>Dionysius V 61 3. D. calls ''Ferentinum'' the ''caput Ferentinae'' or ''aquae Ferentinae'' of Roman authors. See below A. Grandazzi's citations in the discussion of the issue.</ref>\n\n\"Ardea, Aricia, Bovillae, Bubentum, Cora, Carventum, Circei, Corioli, Corbio, Cabum, Fortinea,  Gabii, Laurentum, Lanuvium, Lavinium, Labici, Nomentum, Norba, Praeneste, Pedum, Querquetula, Satricum, Scaptia, Setia, Tibur, Tusculum, Tolerium, Tellenae, Velitrae.\"\n\nAs Niebuhr remarked, once again the total yields the sacred number of thirty, but the sum is made up of different components. It is a mix of some of the members of the ''populi Albenses'' and some of the ''clara oppida''. In fact, many of the ''oppida'' had been destroyed or resettled by the Romans during the regal period, namely Caenina, Politorium, Ficana, Cameria, Medullium, Corniculum, Collatia. Among the ''clara oppida'' of Pliny's list, Satricum, Norba, Sulmo, Scaptia, Tellenae show up here, and among the ''populi albenses'' Bubentum, Corioli, Pedum, Querquetula, Tolerium, and possibly Nomentum.\n\n====Other sources====\nIn his description of Augustan region I, which included Old Latium, the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions many old towns, among them [[Collatia]], [[Antemnae]], [[Fidenae]] and [[Labicum]], as reduced to mere villages, private rural estates or displaced to different locations; [[Apiolae]], [[Suessa]] and [[Alba Longa]] as disappeared; [[Tellenae]] on the foothills southwest of the Alban Hills as still standing.\n\nThe historiographer Livy and the lexicographer [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] also repeatedly mention the old Latin towns.  Another tradition related by [[Philistos of Syracuse]] calls the Sicels Ligurians, whose king was a Sikelos. This tradition is followed by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], who cites [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]] as his authority.\n\nThese ancient traditions have led some scholars to look for traces of the presence of these peoples in later populations.\n\n==Archaeological evidence==\n[[File:Dalla-collezione-di-villa-poniatowski 31961476356 o.jpg|thumb|Polychrome antefix with female head with nimbus from [[Lanuvium]], late-Archic temple of Juno Sospita, 500 B.C., Villa Poniatowski, [[Rome]]]]\n[[File:Statua acroteriale di arpia-sirena, inizi del V sec ac., da gabii (mus. villa giulia).JPG|thumb|Acroterial statue of harpy-siren, beginning of the V century B.C. from [[Gabii]]]]\n[[File:Sima frontonale con processione di carri e cavalli alati, 510-490 ac ca., da palestrina (M. villa giulia) 02.JPG|thumb|Frontonal sima with procession of floats and winged horses, 510-490 B.C., from [[Praeneste]]]]\n[[File:Antefix with Satyr and Maenad dancing from Satricum (Latium vetus) 490-470 BC.jpg|thumb|right|Antefix with Satyr and Maenad dancing from the acropolis, Temple of Mater Matuta, 490-470 BC, from [[Satricum]]]]\nEven though erudite scholars have been trying to ascertain the location of the ancient towns of Latium for at least the last four centuries (see Cluvier), and despite the recent progress made by archaeology in the field of the human settlement of ancient Latium, only a few towns of archaic Latium cited by ancient sources have been identified with certainty, whereas a remarkable number of settlements that have been unearthed remain unidentified. This is due to the lack of epigraphic confirmation, due to the rare use of writing in archaic times. The problem is made even more difficult because some of the ancient locations were possibly resettled during the [[Early Middle Ages]], as was probably the case for Labicum and Collatia. A good instance of such a custom is provided by Falerii outside Latium Vetus.  Towns which have been identified archaeologically include Satricum, Politorium, Ficana, Tellenae, Crustumerium, Corniculum, Antemnae, Collatia, Fidenae, Pedum,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Apiolae, Gabii and perhaps Querquetulum. [[Alba Longa]], Pometia and Corioli remain unidentified. Traces of the presence of the Ligures and Sicels remain in the [[toponymy]] and [[onomastics]].<ref>See the works by  G. Sergi, F. Ribezzo, G. Devoto, G. Alessio and A. Grandazzi cited below.</ref>\n\nThe most conspicuous case and one which has given rise to long-standing debate is Alba Longa. The location of that famous city, according to tradition founded by [[Ascanius]] and the metropolis of the Latins for 418 years, is still a mystery. Some scholars have argued that it has not yet been identified because the Ancients themselves did not know exactly where it was located and the reason for their ignorance was that Alba had never been a real city. It would rather have been a loose collection of small and sparsely populated protohistoric villages organised in the Bronze Age custom around the sanctuary of Mount Albanus and abandoned before it reached the urban stage.<ref>A. Grandazzi \"La localisation d' Alba\" in  MEFRA 1986. See section below.</ref>\n\n===Amitinum===\nThis centre was located to the east of Rome on the Corniculan Mountains, not far from Curniculum. Its identification is due to an inscription that mentions a ''pagus amentinus''.<ref>CIL VI 251.</ref>\n\n===Antemnae===\nThe town of Antemnae was located three miles to the north of Rome on the left bank of the river Anio and close to its confluence with the Tiber. Its name means \"between the rivers\" (Antemnae is the Sabine for Latin ''interamnes''). Some of its ruins were discovered in 1880 during excavations to build the fortress \"Forte Antenne\". Later excavations yielded additional material. The location is now within the urban area of Rome.\n\nAntemnae was colonised by Rome at the time of Romolus during the first effort to control the left bank of the Tiber up to the Anio, thus ensuring a communication  route with Etruria along the Via Salaria. The Antemnates and the Caeninenses were granted full Roman citizenship. Nevertheless, the town revolted several times, the last time in 507 BC.<ref>Dionysius Hal. V 21.</ref>\n\n===Apiolae===\nDestroyed by [[Tarquinius Priscus]], the remains have been identified and excavated. The town was located on Monte Savello between [[Albano Laziale|Albano]] and [[Pavona]]. It housed a temple of Apollo and the famous spring of [[Juturna]], with nearby Lake Turni being the object of a local cult. Today the two water sources are known as the spring of Secciano and the Laghetto di Pavona.\n\n===Aefulae===\nThe site of the settlement of the Alban people Aesulani has been identified with the hilltop castrum of Aefulae near ancient Tibur and close to the site of one of the temples of [[Bona Dea]]. It was deserted by the original dwellers and later resettled by the Romans, who turned it into a military fort.<ref>Aesulae is the Latin pronunciatiation of a Sabine Aefulae i.e. meaning Aedules.</ref>\n\n===Bolae===\nThe site of the Alban people Bolani is frequently mentioned by the historians Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Livy. It was occupied by the Aequians probably already in the late 6th century or in the wars led by [[Coriolanus]].<ref>Dion. Hal. VIII 18.</ref> Its site is not known with certainty, but it must have stood not far from Praeneste and Labicum.\n\n===Corioli===\nThe site of this settlement must have stood on the south-west side of the Alban Hills near Genzano and Lanuvium.\n\n===Pedum===\nThe most important of the Latin towns developed from the ancient ''populi albenses'', [[Pedum]] stood between Tibur and Praeneste near modern [[Gallicano nel Lazio]]. It was taken by the Romans with Coriolanus.<ref>Livy II 39; Plutarch ''Cor.'' 28.</ref> After the final demise of the Latin League, the town declined.\n\n===Tolerium===\nThis settlement of the Alban people was probably not far from Pedum, according to a passage in [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (7.26).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/438853 |title=Places: 438853 (Tolerium) |author=Purcell, N., R.

Becker |accessdate=October 24, 2015<!-- 10:15 pm--> |publisher=Pleiades}}</ref>\n\n===Vitellia===\nThe site of the populus of the Vitellienses was located at the border between the Latins and the Aequians.\n\n===Caenina===\nThe site of [[Caenina (town)|Caenina]] has not yet been identified with certainty. It may have been located near present-day \"La Rustica\" close to the [[Aniene|Anio river]], on a trade route connecting Latium with Etruria and Campania.<ref>P. Zaccagni in ''Civilt\u00e1 del Lazio primitivo. Catalogo della Mostra'' Roma 1976 p. 155.</ref> Festus states it was close to the old Roman settlement. It was originally a settlement of the Sicels, as was Antemnae, who were later expelled by the Aborigenes.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' II 35, 7.</ref>  Dionysius records a tradition according to which Romulus was at Caenina for a sacrifice during the festival of the [[Lupercalia]], which was the occasion of the abduction of [[Romulus and Remus|Remus]] by Numitor's shepherds.<ref>Dionysius ''Roman Antiquities'' II 89.</ref> The town underwent [[synoecism]] and some of its cults and  priests (''sacerdotes'') were transferred to Rome<ref>R. E. A. Palmer  ''The Archaic Community of the Romans'' Cambridge 1970 p. 106 n. 3; A. Alf\u00f6ldi  ''Early Rome and the Latins'' Ann Arbor 1965, p. 132; G. Wissowa  RE  1279.</ref> by Romulus, who celebrated his first triumph after conquering the Caeninenses and killing their king, [[Acron]]. However, according to Dionysius, Romulus allowed the Caeninenses to continue to live in their hometown, although they had to accept a colony of three hundred Romans and the allotment to them of one third of their land.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus II 35, 3-5.</ref> The town is still mentioned at the beginning of the Republic: the Vindicius who revealed the plot of the Aquilii to [[Publius Valerius Publicola]]  was a slave from Caenina captured in war.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' V 7, 3.</ref>\n\nThe town name may be related to Latin ''caenum'' (mud, lime), itself a word with no Indoeuropean etymology.<ref>G. Alessio \"Problemi storico-linguistici messapici\" in ''Studi salentini'' 1962 '''14''' p. 318 n. 131.</ref> Another possibility is that it was of Celtic (Ligurian) origin.\n\n===Cameria or Camerium===\nSince Romulus made this town into a Roman colony, it fought many wars against Rome. In 502 BC it was destroyed, and its ruins have not yet been found; it was located to the north-east of Rome.\n\n===Collatia===\nStrabo places [[Collatia]] some 30 [[stadia (length)|stades]] from Rome. Though by his time it had been reduced to farmland. The location of the site has not yet been identified with certainty, but it was located near modern [[Lunghezza]], to the east of Rome. Likely it stood on the hill now occupied by the [[Castello di Lunghezza]]; which lies at the terminus of the ancient [[Via Collatina]]. The town was conquered and colonized by the Romans. Livy preserves the formula of their surrender, often cited as example of the [[deditio in fide]].\n\nCollatia was founded by the Latin king [[Alba Silvius|Silvius]] of Alba Longa and it was the hometown of [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], one of the first two consuls of the Roman Republic.\n\n===Curniculum or Corniculum===\nThe town has been located by modern scholars in the present position of [[Montecelio]] (formerly Monticelli) in the comune of [[Guidonia Montecelio|Guidonia]], not far from [[Tibur]]. The two adjacent hills shaped like a pair of horns were the source of its name, and the nearby mountain range is still known as \"Monti Cornicolani\". \n\nNear Montecelio, relics dating from the [[Iron Age]] and fragments of pottery from the 7th-6th centuries BC have been discovered. The town was destroyed by Tarquinius Priscus<ref>Livy I 38; 39. Dionysius III 50; IV 1. Ovid  Fasti VI 627 ff.</ref> and was believed to be the hometown of [[Servius Tullius]]'s mother, Ocresia.\n\n===Crustumerium or Crustumeria===\nThe site of [[Crustumerium]] has been known since the 19th century. It is located in the hills of the Riserva Naturale park of Marcigliana Vecchia, to the north of Rome near Settebagni, on the [[Via Salaria]]. The town was also known as ''Castrimoenium'' and ''Crustumeria'' and has given its name to the surrounding countryside and hills known as \"Ager Crustuminus\" and \"Montes Crustumini\". According to Servius it was originally a settlement of the [[Sicels]],  founded by the Sicel Clitemnestrus.<ref>Servius Danielis \"ad Aeneidem\" VII 631 = Cassius Hemina fragm. 2 Peter.</ref> The etymology of the name is unclear and may reflect an ancient Pre-Indo European toponymic ''crustulum'', meaning pond.<ref>Ambra Costanzo Garancini, ''La romanizzazione nel bacino idrografico padano attraverso l\u2019odierna idronimia'', Firenze, La Nuova Italia, 1975 (Pubblicazioni della Facolt\u00e0 di Lettere e Filosofia dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, 75), p. 124.</ref>\n\nCrustumerium has been and is still being excavated by archaeologists and its study has been important for understanding urban development in Old Latium. It was located on one of the routes that linked [[Veii]] and [[Gabii]], close to a ford on the Tiber, which fact, along with the richness of its countryside, was the cause of its importance and wealth.<ref name=\"QuiliciGigli1980\">{{cite book|author1=Lorenzo Quilici|author2=Stefania Quilici Gigli|title=Crustumerium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JREvAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Consiglio nazionale delle ricerche, Centro di studio per l'archeologia etrusco-italica}}</ref>\n\nThe town stretched along a road trench and occupied an area of 60 hectares. It had walls that were a complex made by four or five parallel stretches connected by normal ones and covered with stone slabs. Tombs contained a rich production of fine pottery painted in white and red, weapons, and other instruments from the early Iron Age onward. \n\nThe town is mentioned in the Aeneid, and in the history of Rome it was involved in the abduction of the Sabine women and the subsequent war. Further, Romulus is said to have installed a colony of Romans there. Later it is frequently mentioned in the wars between Rome and its neighbors. \n\nLiterary sources put the destruction of Crustumerium at the end of the sixth century,<ref>Livy II 19.</ref> but archaeologists have shown it was still occupied in the fifth century and declined only in the fourth century.<ref>A. Amoroso \"Crustumerium: a frontier settlement\" in ''Bollettino di Archeologia'' 2001.</ref>\n\n===Ficana===\n[[Ficana]] was located  on the left bank of the Tiber, downstream from Rome, near present-day [[Acilia]] on the highland over Monte Cugno. In ancient times, this provided an advantage as it was steeper and a dominant position on the river. Its identification is confirmed by the find of an inscription. The sources state that it was destroyed twice by Ancus Marcius in his drive to control the lower course of the Tiber and the salines, together with Politorium and Tellenae. Its importance was owed to the fact it was a port that afforded a commercial route to the hinterland toward the Alban Hills and Aricia.\n\nArchaeologists have shown that it was still a prosperous centre during the 4th century and reached its maximum expansion after the Roman conquest. It declined only in the 4th and 3rd centuries after the development of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]. Excavations have unearthed the town wall, housing areas and a necropolis. Long-necked [[amphora]]s  decorated with reliefs or scratches of a style typical of 7th-century Old Latium testify to the early quality of the local material culture. The Ficana site is now an archaeological park.{{When|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Medullium===\nAlso known in the sources as [[Medullia]], its exact location is unknown. It was the hometown of [[Hostus Hostilius]]'s family and was conquered by Tullus Hostilius, although not destroyed. Its name suggests a relationship to the Ligurian tribe of the Medulli (Medylloi in Strabon IV 1, 11) and would appear to be cognate with the Celtic deity Meduna.<ref>G. Alessio \"Genti e favelle dell'antica Apulia\" Cressati Taranto 1949 p. 17 n. 3 (= ''Archivio Storico Pugliese''  II 1949) citing Holder ''Altceltische Sprache'' II col. 528: cfr. German ''Met''.</ref> Strabo<ref>IV 6.</ref> mentions two other towns named Medullia, one on the western alps in Gallia and one on the eastern alps in Iapudia.\n\n===Politorium===\n[[Politorium]] has been identified in the archaic settlement found near [[Castel di Decima]], south-east of Rome, but this identification lacks epigraphic confirmation. It is mentioned by Cato, who records its founding, and by Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassos, who describe its capture and successive demolition by Ancus Marcius. Its inhabitants would have been deported to the Aventine. These facts are part of the first expansive drive by Rome toward the sea, which also brought about the fall of Ficana and Tellenae.\n\nThe excavations have uncovered remains of the fortifications and a princely necropolis.\n\n===Satricum===\n[[Satricum]] was recorded by Pliny as the first in his list of ''clara oppida''. It was an important and ancient settlement of the Latin and other tribes and arose near the prehistoric sanctuary of [[Mater Matuta]]. It has been identified by archaeologists at Le Ferriere, in the present [[Province of Latina]], and it was systematically excavated by the Royal Dutch Institute in Rome in collaboration with Italian authorities. During excavations in 1977 the inscription known as [[Lapis Satricanus]] was unearthed.<ref name=\"Stibbe1980\">{{cite book|author=C. M. Stibbe|title=Lapis Satricanus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lvseAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Ministerie van Cultuur, Recreatie en Maatschappelijk Werk|isbn=978-90-12-02951-3}}</ref>\n\n===Scaptia===\nThe town is mentioned by Livy<ref>Livy AUC VIII 17.</ref> as the eponymous settlement of the Roman tribe of the same name. Its location has not been identified, with some scholars suggesting that it was located near Tibur or near Passerano.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/438829 |title=Places: 438829 (Scaptia) |author=Purcell, N., R.

Becker |accessdate=October 24, 2015<!-- 10:02 pm--> |publisher=Pleiades}}</ref>\n\n==Modern studies on the settlement of prehistoric Latium==\n===Linguistic comparisons===\n[[Wolfgang Helbig]] was the first to remark that the name of Alba Longa and of many other Ligurian settlements, such as ''Albieis'' north of Massalia, with their centre [[Alba Augusta]], as well as Albium (Albion) Intemelium (now [[Ventimiglia]]), Albium (Albion) Ingaunum (now [[Albenga]]) and [[Alba Pompeia]] in Italy, could hardly mean \"white\", from the Latin adjective ''albus'', since the rocks in the area of volcanic Mount Albanus are deep grey in colour.<ref>W. Helbig ''Die Italiker in der Poebene'' 1879.</ref> [[Giuseppe Sergi]]<ref>G. Sergi ''Da Albalonga a Roma. Inizio dell'incivilimento in Italia, ovvero Liguri e Siculi'' Turin 1934 p. 3ff.</ref> remarked that the early name of the Tiber was Albula, a name that recurs elsewhere in [[hydronymy]] where there are traces of Ligurians and Sicels.<ref>The Albula, a source near Tibur. The Albula oracle in Virgil's Aeneis. An Albula river in Picenum near Numana, town that Pliny NH III 13 ascribes to the Sicels; another one in the Lepontine Alps; one in the Grisons canton of present day Switzerland. The Albinia river in Etruria (now [[Albegna]]), a river Alba in Sicily and another one in Northeast Spain.</ref> Further evidence connecting Ligures and Siculi was provided by a neolithic skeleton unearthed at Sgurgola near [[Anagni]] that was painted red, as were the ones found in the Ligurian cave of the \"[[Arene Candide]]\". Sergi concluded that Ligures and Siceli were in fact just one [[ethnic group]], but since they lived far apart, they had come to be considered as two distinct nations. Their identity could be confirmed by ancient [[toponymy|toponyms]] found in Latium as well as other regions of Italy. Strabon also mentions that a former name for the Alps was Albia.\n\nOther correspondences include the ancient name of the [[Lake of Bracciano]], ''Sabatinus Lacus'' and the town of Sabate on its shores, and the river S\u0101pis in Umbria, names based on a [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]] root *s\u0101b- meaning water, seen also in the name [[Vada Sabatia]] (today [[Vado Ligure]]).<ref>C.

In the lowlands, cereals and legumes were grown. In the hills, grapes were planted, and wines such as Setinus, Albanus, and Signinus, were of good quality.<ref>Strabo V 3, 2; V 3, 10.</ref> In the highlands, animal husbandry took the place of food production as an economic force.     \n\n[[Gabii]] had famous quarries of red [[travertine]] stone, which was used as building material in the surrounding area, Rome included.<ref>Strabo V 3, 10-11.</ref> Crafts, such as smithing and pottery, were also developed. \n\nDiseases like [[malaria]] were restricted to coastal areas and a few other locations.\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[Latium]] \u2014 ''all periods''.\n* [[New Latium]]\n* {{C|History of Lazio}}\n* {{C|History of Rome}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n{{Commons category|Latium vetus}}\n{{coord missing|Italy}}\n{{Ancient Rome topics|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:History of Rome|Latium, Old]]\n[[Category:History of Lazio|Latium, Old]]\n[[Category:Geographical, historical and cultural regions of Italy|Latium, Old]]\n[[Category:Metropolitan City of Rome Capital|Latium, Old]]\n[[Category:Latial culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove\n| date = April 2017\n}}[[File:Ligue-latine-carte.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Latium with the cities of the Latin League]]\n'''Old Latium''' ({{lang-la|Latium vetus}} or ''{{lang|la|Latium antiquum}}'') is a region of the [[Italian peninsula]] bounded to the north by the [[river Tiber]], to the east by the central [[Apennine mountains]], to the west by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and to the south by [[Monte Circeo]]. It was the territory of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], an [[Italic tribe]] which included the early inhabitants of the city of [[Rome]]. Later it was also settled by various Italic tribes such as the [[Rutulians]], [[Volscians]], [[Aequi]], and [[Hernici]].<ref>Strabon ''Geography'' III 10.</ref> The region was referred to as \"old\" to distinguish it from the expanded region, [[Latium]], that included the region to the south of Old Latium, between [[Mount Circeo|Monte Circeo]] and the river [[Garigliano]] \u2013 the so-called [[Latium adiectum]] (\"attached Latium\"). It corresponded to the central part of the modern administrative region of [[Lazio]], [[Italy]], and it covered an area measuring of roughly 50 [[Roman miles]].<ref>Pliny ''NH'' III 56.</ref> It was calculated by [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] that the region's area was about 1860 square kilometres.<ref>T. Mommsen ''History of Rome'' I 3, 3.</ref>\n\n==Settlement==\n====Literary tradition====\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] has preserved extensive information on the settlement of Latium in his book, ''<nowiki/>'Roman Antiquities''<nowiki/>', where he listed and discussed many legends and traditional stories related by historians and scholars, both Greek and Roman, on how Latium was settled. [[Pliny the Elder]] also wrote about Old Latium. In his book '''[[Naturalis Historia|Natural History]]''<nowiki/>', he lists two settlements in Old Latium that at the time of writing had disappeared. Other important literary sources include [[Livy]], [[Strabo]], [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], and [[Servius Danielis]].\n\nAccording to these sources Latium was first settled long ago by [[Sicels]] and [[Ligures]],<ref>Festus s. v.  ''sacrani'' p. 424 L: \"''Sacrani'' are named those who moved from Reate and expelled the Sicels and Ligures from the ''Septimontium''\"; Servius Danielis ''Ad Aeneidem'' XI 371, VIII ; Dionysius of  Halicarnassus ''RA'' I  12, 2 citing  Sophocles's ''Triptolemus'' on Oenotrians and Ligures settling the coasts of the Tyrrhenian Sea.</ref> but many sources contradict or do not state which of the two groups first settled Latium. According to the literary tradition, the Sicels and Ligures were forced out of Latium by the constant pressure exerted by the [[Aborigines (mythology)|Aborigines]], who dwelt in [[Reate]], causing the Ligures to migrate to [[Liguria]] and the Sicels to [[Sicily]]. The migration of the tribes appears to have been from the hills and mountains of the region down towards the plains, although there are testimonies of Greek colonizers migrating by sea into the region, as in the legend of [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]], and to southern Italy, as the Sicels were considered to be both [[Oenotrians]] of Greek origin,<ref>Dionysius of Hal. ''RA''  I 12, 3.</ref> and [[Rutulians|Rutulian]] of [[Dauni|Daunian]] origin.\n\nThe arrival of the [[Aeneads]] and the founding of [[Lavinium]] are claimed to mark the beginning of civilization in Latium<ref>http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2007.01.0058</ref>, and 30 years after these events [[Alba Longa|Alba]] was founded, the city that led the [[Latin League]], a coalition of 30 cities and tribes that lasted for 500 years. While there are many different myths on the founding of these cities, it is known that the region and the Latin League were religiously influenced by the cult of Iuppiter Latiaris,  an [[Epithets of Jupiter|epithet of Jupiter]], and venerated this god as the high protector of the league.\n\n====Pliny's list====\nThe accounting provided by Pliny the Elder does not include all the centres of Latium Vetus that later developed into towns, but rather lists those which, according to the scholar, had disappeared by his time without leaving any trace. Therefore, he does not mention [[Anxur]], [[Tibur]], [[Cora (Ancient Latin town)|Cora]], [[Ficulea]], [[Nomentum]], [[Praeneste]], [[Gabii]], [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]], [[Ariccia|Aricia]], [[Tusculum]], [[Lavinium]], [[Laurentum]], [[Lanuvium]], [[Labicum]], and [[Velitrae]], which were still standing, with the exception of old Labicum. But some settlements he mentions were in fact visited by Strabo only seventy years earlier (such as [[Tellenae]]), and some still certainly stood in his own time, such as [[Pedum]]. Another oddity of the passage is that while he claims there were fifty-three centres that had disappeared, his list numbers only fifty. Even though elsewhere he mentions two other sites, [[Apiolae]] and [[Amyclae (Italy)|Amyclae]], this still does not equal fifty-three. The list is in book III of his ''Natural History'' ch. 68 and 69:\n\n\"In the first region moreover in Latium were the famous walled towns (''clara oppida'') [[Satricum]], Scaptia, [[Politorium]], [[Tellena]], [[Tifata]], [[Caenina (town)|Caenina]], [[Ficana]], [[Crustumeria]], [[Ameriola]], [[Medullum]], [[Corniculum]], Saturnia now which is Rome, Antipolis (which is now the [[Janiculum]], a place in Rome), [[Antemnae]], [[Cameria|Camerium]], [[Collatia]], [[Amitinum]], [[Norba]], and [[Sulmo]]. Together with them the Alban Peoples who use to receive the (sacrificial) meat on the Alban Mount: Albani, Aesolani, Accienses, Abolani, Bubetani, Bolani, Cusuetani, Coriolani, Fidenates, Foreti, Hortenses, Latinienses, Longani, Manates, Macrales, Munienses, Numinienses, Olliculani, Octulani, Pedani, Poletaurini, Querquetulani, Sicani, Sisolenses, Tolerienses, Tutienses, Vimitellari, Velienses, Venetulani, Vitellienses.\"\n\nThe list is apparently made up of two sections, the first is referred to as ''clara oppida'' and the second as ''populi Albenses''. The last two towns mentioned among the ''clara oppida'', Norba and Sulmo, were in fact within Latium Adiectum. They were destroyed in the 1st{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BC during the war between Marius and Sulla.\n\nThe second section gives the names of the ''populi Albenses''. These were local communities inhabiting the region of ''Mons Albanus'' (now Monte Cavo) and its immediate surroundings, the Alban Hills. Only some of them seem to have reached the urban stage and the list reflects the typical archaic [[Bronze Age]] organization of  human settlement: sparse, polycentric and gravitating around a religious centre, in this case the sanctuary of ''Iuppiter Latiaris''. The exact location of these settlements is unknown with a few exceptions: Aesulae, Pedum,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Fidenae, Politorium, Bovillae, and Tolerium. It is possible that the Latinienses were settlers of the Ager Latiniensis, i. e. the area near Laurentum and Lavinium,<ref>Cf. Cicero ''De Haruspicum Responso'': a crack sound was heard in the  Ager Latiniensis.</ref> and that the Foreti were actually settlers of the area later occupied by the Roman Forum. The Querquetulani, however, were certainly not the settlers of the Querquetulan (i.e. Caelian ) Hill in Rome as they are mentioned by Dionysius in the list of Latin peoples who went to war against Rome in 495.\n\n====Dionysius's list====\nDionysius gives a list of the towns members  of the Latin League that voted for war against Rome after the capture of Fidenae by the Romans, under the influence of Aricia and of former king Tarquinius the Proud at an assembly held at Ferentinum:<ref>Dionysius V 61 3. D. calls ''Ferentinum'' the ''caput Ferentinae'' or ''aquae Ferentinae'' of Roman authors. See below A. Grandazzi's citations in the discussion of the issue.</ref>\n\n\"Ardea, Aricia, Bovillae, Bubentum, Cora, Carventum, Circei, Corioli, Corbio, Cabum, Fortinea,  Gabii, Laurentum, Lanuvium, Lavinium, Labici, Nomentum, Norba, Praeneste, Pedum, Querquetula, Satricum, Scaptia, Setia, Tibur, Tusculum, Tolerium, Tellenae, Velitrae.\"\n\nAs Niebuhr remarked, once again the total yields the sacred number of thirty, but the sum is made up of different components. It is a mix of some of the members of the ''populi Albenses'' and some of the ''clara oppida''. In fact, many of the ''oppida'' had been destroyed or resettled by the Romans during the regal period, namely Caenina, Politorium, Ficana, Cameria, Medullium, Corniculum, Collatia. Among the ''clara oppida'' of Pliny's list, Satricum, Norba, Sulmo, Scaptia, Tellenae show up here, and among the ''populi albenses'' Bubentum, Corioli, Pedum, Querquetula, Tolerium, and possibly Nomentum.\n\n====Other sources====\nIn his description of Augustan region I, which included Old Latium, the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions many old towns, among them [[Collatia]], [[Antemnae]], [[Fidenae]] and [[Labicum]], as reduced to mere villages, private rural estates or displaced to different locations; [[Apiolae]], [[Suessa]] and [[Alba Longa]] as disappeared; [[Tellenae]] on the foothills southwest of the Alban Hills as still standing.\n\nThe historiographer Livy and the lexicographer [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] also repeatedly mention the old Latin towns.  Another tradition related by [[Philistos of Syracuse]] calls the Sicels Ligurians, whose king was a Sikelos. This tradition is followed by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], who cites [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]] as his authority.\n\nThese ancient traditions have led some scholars to look for traces of the presence of these peoples in later populations.\n\n==Archaeological evidence==\n[[File:Dalla-collezione-di-villa-poniatowski 31961476356 o.jpg|thumb|Polychrome antefix with female head with nimbus from [[Lanuvium]], late-Archic temple of Juno Sospita, 500 B.C., Villa Poniatowski, [[Rome]]]]\n[[File:Statua acroteriale di arpia-sirena, inizi del V sec ac., da gabii (mus. villa giulia).JPG|thumb|Acroterial statue of harpy-siren, beginning of the V century B.C. from [[Gabii]]]]\n[[File:Sima frontonale con processione di carri e cavalli alati, 510-490 ac ca., da palestrina (M. villa giulia) 02.JPG|thumb|Frontonal sima with procession of floats and winged horses, 510-490 B.C., from [[Praeneste]]]]\n[[File:Antefix with Satyr and Maenad dancing from Satricum (Latium vetus) 490-470 BC.jpg|thumb|right|Antefix with Satyr and Maenad dancing from the acropolis, Temple of Mater Matuta, 490-470 BC, from [[Satricum]]]]\nEven though erudite scholars have been trying to ascertain the location of the ancient towns of Latium for at least the last four centuries (see Cluvier), and despite the recent progress made by archaeology in the field of the human settlement of ancient Latium, only a few towns of archaic Latium cited by ancient sources have been identified with certainty, whereas a remarkable number of settlements that have been unearthed remain unidentified. This is due to the lack of epigraphic confirmation, due to the rare use of writing in archaic times. The problem is made even more difficult because some of the ancient locations were possibly resettled during the [[Early Middle Ages]], as was probably the case for Labicum and Collatia. A good instance of such a custom is provided by Falerii outside Latium Vetus.  Towns which have been identified archaeologically include Satricum, Politorium, Ficana, Tellenae, Crustumerium, Corniculum, Antemnae, Collatia, Fidenae, Pedum,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Apiolae, Gabii and perhaps Querquetulum. [[Alba Longa]], Pometia and Corioli remain unidentified. Traces of the presence of the Ligures and Sicels remain in the [[toponymy]] and [[onomastics]].<ref>See the works by  G. Sergi, F. Ribezzo, G. Devoto, G. Alessio and A. Grandazzi cited below.</ref>\n\nThe most conspicuous case and one which has given rise to long-standing debate is Alba Longa. The location of that famous city, according to tradition founded by [[Ascanius]] and the metropolis of the Latins for 418 years, is still a mystery. Some scholars have argued that it has not yet been identified because the Ancients themselves did not know exactly where it was located and the reason for their ignorance was that Alba had never been a real city. It would rather have been a loose collection of small and sparsely populated protohistoric villages organised in the Bronze Age custom around the sanctuary of Mount Albanus and abandoned before it reached the urban stage.<ref>A. Grandazzi \"La localisation d' Alba\" in  MEFRA 1986. See section below.</ref>\n\n===Amitinum===\nThis centre was located to the east of Rome on the Corniculan Mountains, not far from Curniculum. Its identification is due to an inscription that mentions a ''pagus amentinus''.<ref>CIL VI 251.</ref>\n\n===Antemnae===\nThe town of Antemnae was located three miles to the north of Rome on the left bank of the river Anio and close to its confluence with the Tiber. Its name means \"between the rivers\" (Antemnae is the Sabine for Latin ''interamnes''). Some of its ruins were discovered in 1880 during excavations to build the fortress \"Forte Antenne\". Later excavations yielded additional material. The location is now within the urban area of Rome.\n\nAntemnae was colonised by Rome at the time of Romolus during the first effort to control the left bank of the Tiber up to the Anio, thus ensuring a communication  route with Etruria along the Via Salaria. The Antemnates and the Caeninenses were granted full Roman citizenship. Nevertheless, the town revolted several times, the last time in 507 BC.<ref>Dionysius Hal. V 21.</ref>\n\n===Apiolae===\nDestroyed by [[Tarquinius Priscus]], the remains have been identified and excavated. The town was located on Monte Savello between [[Albano Laziale|Albano]] and [[Pavona]]. It housed a temple of Apollo and the famous spring of [[Juturna]], with nearby Lake Turni being the object of a local cult. Today the two water sources are known as the spring of Secciano and the Laghetto di Pavona.\n\n===Aefulae===\nThe site of the settlement of the Alban people Aesulani has been identified with the hilltop castrum of Aefulae near ancient Tibur and close to the site of one of the temples of [[Bona Dea]]. It was deserted by the original dwellers and later resettled by the Romans, who turned it into a military fort.<ref>Aesulae is the Latin pronunciatiation of a Sabine Aefulae i.e. meaning Aedules.</ref>\n\n===Bolae===\nThe site of the Alban people Bolani is frequently mentioned by the historians Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Livy. It was occupied by the Aequians probably already in the late 6th century or in the wars led by [[Coriolanus]].<ref>Dion. Hal. VIII 18.</ref> Its site is not known with certainty, but it must have stood not far from Praeneste and Labicum.\n\n===Corioli===\nThe site of this settlement must have stood on the south-west side of the Alban Hills near Genzano and Lanuvium.\n\n===Pedum===\nThe most important of the Latin towns developed from the ancient ''populi albenses'', [[Pedum]] stood between Tibur and Praeneste near modern [[Gallicano nel Lazio]]. It was taken by the Romans with Coriolanus.<ref>Livy II 39; Plutarch ''Cor.'' 28.</ref> After the final demise of the Latin League, the town declined.\n\n===Tolerium===\nThis settlement of the Alban people was probably not far from Pedum, according to a passage in [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (7.26).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/438853 |title=Places: 438853 (Tolerium) |author=Purcell, N., R.

Becker |accessdate=October 24, 2015<!-- 10:15 pm--> |publisher=Pleiades}}</ref>\n\n===Vitellia===\nThe site of the populus of the Vitellienses was located at the border between the Latins and the Aequians.\n\n===Caenina===\nThe site of [[Caenina]] has not yet been identified with certainty. It may have been located near present-day \"La Rustica\" close to the [[Aniene|Anio river]], on a trade route connecting Latium with Etruria and Campania.<ref>P. Zaccagni in ''Civilt\u00e1 del Lazio primitivo. Catalogo della Mostra'' Roma 1976 p. 155.</ref> Festus states it was close to the old Roman settlement. It was originally a settlement of the Sicels, as was Antemnae, who were later expelled by the Aborigenes.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' II 35, 7.</ref>  Dionysius records a tradition according to which Romulus was at Caenina for a sacrifice during the festival of the [[Lupercalia]], which was the occasion of the abduction of [[Romulus and Remus|Remus]] by Numitor's shepherds.<ref>Dionysius ''Roman Antiquities'' II 89.</ref> The town underwent [[synoecism]] and some of its cults and  priests (''sacerdotes'') were transferred to Rome<ref>R.

Wissowa  RE  1279.</ref> by Romulus, who celebrated his first triumph after conquering the Caeninenses and killing their king, [[Acron]]. However, according to Dionysius, Romulus allowed the Caeninenses to continue to live in their hometown, although they had to accept a colony of three hundred Romans and the allotment to them of one third of their land.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus II 35, 3-5.</ref> The town is still mentioned at the beginning of the Republic: the Vindicius who revealed the plot of the Aquilii to [[Publius Valerius Publicola]]  was a slave from Caenina captured in war.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' V 7, 3.</ref>\n\nThe town name may be related to Latin ''caenum'' (mud, lime), itself a word with no Indoeuropean etymology.<ref>G. Alessio \"Problemi storico-linguistici messapici\" in ''Studi salentini'' 1962 '''14''' p. 318 n. 131.</ref> Another possibility is that it was of Celtic (Ligurian) origin.\n\n===Cameria or Camerium===\nSince Romulus made this town into a Roman colony, it fought many wars against Rome. In 502 BC it was destroyed, and its ruins have not yet been found; it was located to the north-east of Rome.\n\n===Collatia===\nStrabo places [[Collatia]] some 30 [[stadia (length)|stades]] from Rome. Though by his time it had been reduced to farmland. The location of the site has not yet been identified with certainty, but it was located near modern [[Lunghezza]], to the east of Rome. Likely it stood on the hill now occupied by the [[Castello di Lunghezza]]; which lies at the terminus of the ancient [[Via Collatina]]. The town was conquered and colonized by the Romans. Livy preserves the formula of their surrender, often cited as example of the [[deditio in fide]].\n\nCollatia was founded by the Latin king [[Alba Silvius|Silvius]] of Alba Longa and it was the hometown of [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], one of the first two consuls of the Roman Republic.\n\n===Curniculum or Corniculum===\nThe town has been located by modern scholars in the present position of [[Montecelio]] (formerly Monticelli) in the comune of [[Guidonia Montecelio|Guidonia]], not far from [[Tibur]]. The two adjacent hills shaped like a pair of horns were the source of its name, and the nearby mountain range is still known as \"Monti Cornicolani\". \n\nNear Montecelio, relics dating from the [[Iron Age]] and fragments of pottery from the 7th-6th centuries BC have been discovered. The town was destroyed by Tarquinius Priscus<ref>Livy I 38; 39. Dionysius III 50; IV 1. Ovid  Fasti VI 627 ff.</ref> and was believed to be the hometown of [[Servius Tullius]]'s mother, Ocresia.\n\n===Crustumerium or Crustumeria===\nThe site of [[Crustumerium]] has been known since the 19th century. It is located in the hills of the Riserva Naturale park of Marcigliana Vecchia, to the north of Rome near Settebagni, on the [[Via Salaria]]. The town was also known as ''Castrimoenium'' and ''Crustumeria'' and has given its name to the surrounding countryside and hills known as \"Ager Crustuminus\" and \"Montes Crustumini\". According to Servius it was originally a settlement of the [[Sicels]],  founded by the Sicel Clitemnestrus.<ref>Servius Danielis \"ad Aeneidem\" VII 631 = Cassius Hemina fragm. 2 Peter.</ref> The etymology of the name is unclear and may reflect an ancient Pre-Indo European toponymic ''crustulum'', meaning pond.<ref>Ambra Costanzo Garancini, ''La romanizzazione nel bacino idrografico padano attraverso l\u2019odierna idronimia'', Firenze, La Nuova Italia, 1975 (Pubblicazioni della Facolt\u00e0 di Lettere e Filosofia dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, 75), p. 124.</ref>\n\nCrustumerium has been and is still being excavated by archaeologists and its study has been important for understanding urban development in Old Latium. It was located on one of the routes that linked [[Veii]] and [[Gabii]], close to a ford on the Tiber, which fact, along with the richness of its countryside, was the cause of its importance and wealth.<ref name=\"QuiliciGigli1980\">{{cite book|author1=Lorenzo Quilici|author2=Stefania Quilici Gigli|title=Crustumerium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JREvAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Consiglio nazionale delle ricerche, Centro di studio per l'archeologia etrusco-italica}}</ref>\n\nThe town stretched along a road trench and occupied an area of 60 hectares. It had walls that were a complex made by four or five parallel stretches connected by normal ones and covered with stone slabs. Tombs contained a rich production of fine pottery painted in white and red, weapons, and other instruments from the early Iron Age onward. \n\nThe town is mentioned in the Aeneid, and in the history of Rome it was involved in the abduction of the Sabine women and the subsequent war. Further, Romulus is said to have installed a colony of Romans there. Later it is frequently mentioned in the wars between Rome and its neighbors. \n\nLiterary sources put the destruction of Crustumerium at the end of the sixth century,<ref>Livy II 19.</ref> but archaeologists have shown it was still occupied in the fifth century and declined only in the fourth century.<ref>A. Amoroso \"Crustumerium: a frontier settlement\" in ''Bollettino di Archeologia'' 2001.</ref>\n\n===Ficana===\n[[Ficana]] was located  on the left bank of the Tiber, downstream from Rome, near present-day [[Acilia]] on the highland over Monte Cugno. In ancient times, this provided an advantage as it was steeper and a dominant position on the river. Its identification is confirmed by the find of an inscription. The sources state that it was destroyed twice by Ancus Marcius in his drive to control the lower course of the Tiber and the salines, together with Politorium and Tellenae. Its importance was owed to the fact it was a port that afforded a commercial route to the hinterland toward the Alban Hills and Aricia.\n\nArchaeologists have shown that it was still a prosperous centre during the 4th century and reached its maximum expansion after the Roman conquest. It declined only in the 4th and 3rd centuries after the development of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]. Excavations have unearthed the town wall, housing areas and a necropolis. Long-necked [[amphora]]s  decorated with reliefs or scratches of a style typical of 7th-century Old Latium testify to the early quality of the local material culture. The Ficana site is now an archaeological park.{{When|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Medullium===\nAlso known in the sources as [[Medullia]], its exact location is unknown. It was the hometown of [[Hostus Hostilius]]'s family and was conquered by Tullus Hostilius, although not destroyed. Its name suggests a relationship to the Ligurian tribe of the Medulli (Medylloi in Strabon IV 1, 11) and would appear to be cognate with the Celtic deity Meduna.<ref>G. Alessio \"Genti e favelle dell'antica Apulia\" Cressati Taranto 1949 p. 17 n. 3 (= ''Archivio Storico Pugliese''  II 1949) citing Holder ''Altceltische Sprache'' II col. 528: cfr. German ''Met''.</ref> Strabo<ref>IV 6.</ref> mentions two other towns named Medullia, one on the western alps in Gallia and one on the eastern alps in Iapudia.\n\n===Politorium===\n[[Politorium]] has been identified in the archaic settlement found near [[Castel di Decima]], south-east of Rome, but this identification lacks epigraphic confirmation. It is mentioned by Cato, who records its founding, and by Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassos, who describe its capture and successive demolition by Ancus Marcius. Its inhabitants would have been deported to the Aventine. These facts are part of the first expansive drive by Rome toward the sea, which also brought about the fall of Ficana and Tellenae.\n\nThe excavations have uncovered remains of the fortifications and a princely necropolis.\n\n===Satricum===\n[[Satricum]] was recorded by Pliny as the first in his list of ''clara oppida''. It was an important and ancient settlement of the Latin and other tribes and arose near the prehistoric sanctuary of [[Mater Matuta]]. It has been identified by archaeologists at Le Ferriere, in the present [[Province of Latina]], and it was systematically excavated by the Royal Dutch Institute in Rome in collaboration with Italian authorities. During excavations in 1977 the inscription known as [[Lapis Satricanus]] was unearthed.<ref name=\"Stibbe1980\">{{cite book|author=C. M.

Its location has not been identified, with some scholars suggesting that it was located near Tibur or near Passerano.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/438829 |title=Places: 438829 (Scaptia) |author=Purcell, N., R.

Becker |accessdate=October 24, 2015<!-- 10:02 pm--> |publisher=Pleiades}}</ref>\n\n==Modern studies on the settlement of prehistoric Latium==\n===Linguistic comparisons===\n[[Wolfgang Helbig]] was the first to remark that the name of Alba Longa and of many other Ligurian settlements, such as ''Albieis'' north of Massalia, with their centre [[Alba Augusta]], as well as Albium (Albion) Intemelium (now [[Ventimiglia]]), Albium (Albion) Ingaunum (now [[Albenga]]) and [[Alba Pompeia]] in Italy, could hardly mean \"white\", from the Latin adjective ''albus'', since the rocks in the area of volcanic Mount Albanus are deep grey in colour.<ref>W. Helbig ''Die Italiker in der Poebene'' 1879.</ref> [[Giuseppe Sergi]]<ref>G. Sergi ''Da Albalonga a Roma. Inizio dell'incivilimento in Italia, ovvero Liguri e Siculi'' Turin 1934 p. 3ff.</ref> remarked that the early name of the Tiber was Albula, a name that recurs elsewhere in [[hydronymy]] where there are traces of Ligurians and Sicels.<ref>The Albula, a source near Tibur. The Albula oracle in Virgil's Aeneis. An Albula river in Picenum near Numana, town that Pliny NH III 13 ascribes to the Sicels; another one in the Lepontine Alps; one in the Grisons canton of present day Switzerland. The Albinia river in Etruria (now [[Albegna]]), a river Alba in Sicily and another one in Northeast Spain.</ref> Further evidence connecting Ligures and Siculi was provided by a neolithic skeleton unearthed at Sgurgola near [[Anagni]] that was painted red, as were the ones found in the Ligurian cave of the \"[[Arene Candide]]\". Sergi concluded that Ligures and Siceli were in fact just one [[ethnic group]], but since they lived far apart, they had come to be considered as two distinct nations. Their identity could be confirmed by ancient [[toponymy|toponyms]] found in Latium as well as other regions of Italy. Strabon also mentions that a former name for the Alps was Albia.\n\nOther correspondences include the ancient name of the [[Lake of Bracciano]], ''Sabatinus Lacus'' and the town of Sabate on its shores, and the river S\u0101pis in Umbria, names based on a [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]] root *s\u0101b- meaning water, seen also in the name [[Vada Sabatia]] (today [[Vado Ligure]]).<ref>C.
