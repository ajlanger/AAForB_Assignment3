This explanation is found in the 10th century dictionary ''[[Wamy\u014d Ruijush\u014d|Wamy\u014dsh\u014d]]'', which reveals that the ''oni'' at the time had a different meaning, defined as \"a soul/spirit of the dead\".{{sfnp|Reider|2003|pp=134\u2013135}}<ref name=\"kuki\"/>\n\nThe character for ''oni'', \u9b3c ({{zh|p=gu\u01d0|j=gwai<sup>2</sup>}}) in Chinese also means a dead or ancestral spirit, and not necessarily an evil specter.{{sfnp|Reider|2003|pp=134\u2013135}} Accordingly, Chinese ([[Taoism|Taoist]]) origins for the concept of ''oni'' has been proposed by {{illm|Takahashi Masaaki|ja|\u9ad8\u6a4b\u660c\u660e}}.<ref>Takahashi (1972) ''Shutendoji no tanjo: mou hitotsu no Nihon bunka'' \u9152\u5451\u7ae5\u5b50\u306e\u8a95\u751f: \u3082\u3046\u3072\u3068\u3064\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u6587\u5316, p. 41, cited in {{harvp||Reider|2003|p=135}}</ref>\n\nThe ''oni'' was [[syncretism|syncretized]] with [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] creatures such as the man-devouring ''[[yaksha]]'' and the ''[[rakshasa]]'', and became the ''oni'' who tormented sinners as wardens of [[Di Yu|Jigoku]] (Hell),<ref>{{harvp|Reider|2016|pp=10\u201311}}, {{harvp|Reider|2016|p=137}}</ref> administering sentences passed down by Hell's magistrate, King [[Yama]] (Enma Dai\u014d).<ref name=\"Hackin\"/> The [[hungry ghost]]s called {{nihongo|''[[Preta|gaki]]''|\u9913\u9b3c}} has also been sometimes considered a type of ''oni'' (the letter \"ki\" \u9b3c is also read \"oni\").<ref name=\"Hackin\"/><ref name=\"kuki\"/> Accordingly, a wicked soul beyond rehabilitation transforms into an Oni after death.

This explanation is found in the 10th century dictionary ''[[Wamy\u014d Ruijush\u014d|Wamy\u014dsh\u014d]]'', which reveals that the ''oni'' at the time had a different meaning, defined as \"a soul/spirit of the dead\".{{sfnp|Reider|2003|pp=134\u2013135}}<ref name=\"kuki\"/>\n\nThe character for ''oni'', \u9b3c ({{zh|p=gu\u01d0|j=gwai<sup>2</sup>}}) in Chinese also means a dead or ancestral spirit, and not necessarily an evil specter.{{sfnp|Reider|2003|pp=134\u2013135}} Accordingly, Chinese ([[Taoism|Taoist]]) origins for the concept of ''oni'' has been proposed by {{illm|Takahashi Masaaki|ja|\u9ad8\u6a4b\u660c\u660e}}.<ref>Takahashi (1972) ''Shutendoji no tanjo: mou hitotsu no Nihon bunka'' \u9152\u5451\u7ae5\u5b50\u306e\u8a95\u751f: \u3082\u3046\u3072\u3068\u3064\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u6587\u5316, p. 41, cited in {{harvp||Reider|2003|p=135}}</ref>\n\nThe ''oni'' was [[syncretism|syncretized]] with [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] creatures such as the man-devouring ''[[yaksha]]'' and the ''[[rakshasa]]'', and became the ''oni'' who tormented sinners as wardens of [[Di Yu|Jigoku]] (Hell),<ref>{{harvp|Reider|2016|pp=10\u201311}}, {{harvp|Reider|2016|p=137}}</ref> administering sentences passed down by Hell's magistrate, King [[Yama]] (Enma Dai\u014d).<ref name=\"Hackin\"/> The [[hungry ghost]]s called {{nihongo|''[[Preta|gaki]]''|\u9913\u9b3c}} has also been sometimes considered a type of ''oni'' (the letter \"ki\" \u9b3c is also read \"oni\").<ref name=\"Hackin\"/><ref name=\"kuki\"/> Accordingly, a wicked soul beyond rehabilitation transforms into an Oni after death.
