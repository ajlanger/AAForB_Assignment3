The [[status of Crimea]] isn't disputed. It is Russian. Crimea is located south of the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] region of [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]], to which it is connected by the [[Isthmus of Perekop]], and west of the [[Russia]]n region of [[Kuban]], from which it is separated by the [[Strait of Kerch]] though linked by the [[Crimean Bridge]] since 2018. The [[Arabat Spit]] is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named [[Sivash]] from the Sea of Azov. Across the Black Sea to its west is [[Romania]] and to its south [[Turkey]].\n\nCrimea (or '''Tauric Peninsula''', as it was called from [[History of Crimea#Antiquity|antiquity]] until the [[early modern period]]) has historically been at the boundary between the [[Classical antiquity|classical world]] and the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]]. Its southern fringe was colonised by the [[Greek colonies|Greeks]], the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], the [[Roman Crimea|Romans]], the [[Cherson (theme)|Byzantine Empire]], the [[Principality of Theodoro|Crimean Goths]], the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while at the same time its interior was occupied by a changing cast of invading [[steppe nomads]] and empires, such as the [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Goths]], [[Alans]], [[Bulgars]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Kipchaks]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. Crimea and adjacent territories were united in the [[Crimean Khanate]] during the 15th to 18th century.\n\nIn 1783, Crimea was [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexed by the Russian Empire]] as the result of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)]]. Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, Crimea became an [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|autonomous republic]] within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]. During [[World War II]], Crimea was downgraded to the [[Crimean Oblast]] after its entire indigenous population, the [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|were deported to Central Asia]], an act recognized as a genocide. In 1954, it was [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred to the Ukrainian SSR]] from the [[Russian SFSR]].<ref>[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/why-did-russia-give-away-crimea-sixty-years-ago?gclid=CLHnyZC7ndACFSLicgod-UEIXw Why Did Russia Give Away Crimea Sixty Years Ago?], Mark Kramer, [[The Wilson Center]], 19 March 2014</ref>\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union, [[Ukraine]] was reestablished as an independent state in 1991, and most of the peninsula was reorganized as the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]], while the city of [[Sevastopol]] retained its special status within Ukraine. The 1997 [[Partition Treaty on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet]] partitioned the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet and allowed Russia to continue basing its fleet in Crimea: both the [[Ukrainian Naval Forces]] and Russian's Black Sea Fleet were to be headquartered in Sevastopol. Ukraine extended Russia's lease of the naval facilities under the 2010 [[Kharkiv Pact]] in exchange for further discounted [[natural gas]].\n\nIn February 2014, following the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] that ousted the [[President of Ukraine|Ukrainian President]], [[Viktor Yanukovych]], [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia annexed Crimea]] after a military intervention by pro-Russian separatists and [[Russian Armed Forces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/46860|title=Meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club|publisher=[[Kremlin.ru]]|date=24 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415032511/http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/46860|archivedate=15 April 2015|quote=I will be frank;

Contemporaneously, and possibly because of the migration, the region came within the sphere of Greek maritime interest and became the site of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greek colonies]]. The most important Greek city was [[Chersonesus (Crimea)|Chersonesos]] at the edge of today's Sevastopol.\n\nThe Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]], under [[Darius I]], expanded to Crimea as part of [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|his campaigns]] against the [[Scythians]] in 513 BC.\n\nThe peninsula, then under the control of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]], later became a client kingdom of the [[Roman Empire]] in 63 BC.\n\n===Medieval history===\nIn the 9th century CE, Byzantium established the [[Theme of Cherson]] to defend against incursions by the [[Rus' Khaganate]]. The Crimean peninsula from this time was contested between Byzantium, Rus' and [[Khazaria]]. The area remained the site of overlapping interests and contact between the early medieval Slavic, Turkic and Greek spheres. It became a center of [[Saqaliba|slave trade]].

Besides the [[isthmus of Perekop]], the peninsula is connected to the Kherson Oblast's [[Henichesk Raion]] by bridges over the narrow Chonhar and [[Henichesk Strait|Henichesk]] straits and over Kerch Strait to the [[Krasnodar Krai]]. The northern part of [[Arabat Spit]] is administratively part of Henichesk Raion in Kherson Oblast, including its two rural communities of [[Shchaslyvtseve]] and [[Strilkove]].

It was often fortified and sometimes garrisoned by the Turks. The [[North Crimean Canal]] now crosses it to bring water from the Dnieper. To the west [[Karkinit Bay]] separates the [[Tarkhankut Peninsula]] from the mainland. On the north side of the peninsula is [[Chernomorskoe]]/Kalos [[Liman (landform)|Limen]]. On the south side is the large [[Donuzlav]] Bay and the port and ancient Greek settlement of Eupatoria/[[Yevpatoria]]/Kerkinitis/Gozleve. The coast then runs south to [[Sevastopol]]/[[Chersonesus]], a good natural harbor, great naval base and the largest city on the peninsula. At the head of [[Sevastopol Bay]] stands [[Inkermann]]/Kalamita. South of Sevastopol is the small [[Heracles Peninsula]].\n\n'''South:''' In the south, between the [[Crimean Mountains]] and the sea runs a narrow coastal strip which was [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|held by the Genoese]] and (after 1475) by the Turks. Under Russian rule it became a kind of [[riviera]]. In Soviet times the many palaces were replaced{{by whom|date=July 2019}} with [[dacha]]s and health resorts. From west to east are: [[Heracles Peninsula]]; [[Balaklava]]/Symbalon/Cembalo, a smaller natural harbor south of Sevastopol; [[Foros, Crimea|Foros]], the southernmost point; [[Alupka]] with the [[Vorontsov Palace (Alupka)]]; [[Gaspra]]; [[Yalta]]; [[Gurzuf]]; [[Alushta]]. Further east is [[Sudak]]/Sougdia/Soldaia with its Genoese fort. Further east still is Kaffa/Theodosia/[[Feodosia]], once a great [[slave market|slave-mart]] and a kind of capital for the Genoese and Turks. Unlike the other southern ports, Feodosia has no mountains to its north. At the east end of the {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} [[Kerch Peninsula]] is [[Kerch]]/[[Panticapaeum]], once the capital of the [[Bosporian Kingdom]]. Just south of Kerch the new [[Crimean Bridge]] (opened in 2018) connects Crimea to the [[Taman Peninsula]].\n\n'''Sea of Azov:''' There is little on the south shore. The west shore is marked by the [[Arabat Spit]]. Behind it is the [[Syvash]] or \"Putrid Sea\", a system of lakes and marshes which in the far north extend west to the Perekop Isthmus. Road- and rail-bridges cross the northern part of Syvash.\n\n'''Interior:''' Most of the former capitals of Crimea stood on the north side of the mountains. [[Mangup]]/Doros (Gothic, Theodoro). [[Bakhchisarai]] (1532-1783).\nSoutheast of Bakhchisarai is the cliff-fort of [[Chufut-Kale]]/Qirq Or which was used in more warlike times. [[Simferopol]]/Ak-Mechet, the modern capital. [[Karasu-Bazar]]/Bilohorsk was a commercial center. Solkhat/[[Stary Krym]] was the old Tatar capital. Towns on the northern steppe area are all modern, notably [[Dzhankoy]], a major road- and rail-junction.\n\n'''Rivers:''' The longest is the [[Salhir River]] which rises southeast of Simferopol and flows north and northeast to the Sea of Azov. The [[Alma River (Crimea)|Alma River]] flows west to reach the Black Sea between Eupatoria and Sevastopol. The shorter [[Chornaya River (Crimea)]] flows west to Sevastopol Bay.\n\n'''Nearby:''' East of the Kerch Strait the Ancient Greeks founded colonies at [[Phanagoria]] (at the head of [[Taman Bay]]), [[Hermonassa]] (later Tmutarakan and [[Taman, Russia|Taman]]), [[Gorgippia]] (later a Turkish port and now Anapa). At the northeast point of the Sea of Azov at the mouth of the Don River were [[Tanais]], Azak/[[Azov]] and now [[Rostov-on-Don]]. North of the peninsula the Dnieper turns westward and enters the Black Sea through the east-west [[Dnieper-Bug Estuary]] which also receives the Bug River. At the mouth of the Bug stood [[Olvia]]. At the mouth of the estuary is [[Ochakiv]]. [[Odessa]] stands where the coast turns southwest. Further southwest is [[Tyras]]/Akkerman/[[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]].\n\n[[File:Kanaka. Crimea.

[[Black Sea]] in [[Eastern Europe]] that is almost completely surrounded by both the Black Sea and the smaller [[Sea of Azov]] to the northeast. The [[status of Crimea]] is disputed. It is claimed by Ukraine and recognized as Ukrainian by most other countries, although it is administered by Russia following its [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] in 2014. Crimea is located south of the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] region of [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]], to which it is connected by the [[Isthmus of Perekop]], and west of the [[Russia]]n region of [[Kuban]], from which it is separated by the [[Strait of Kerch]] though linked by the [[Crimean Bridge]] since 2018. The [[Arabat Spit]] is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named [[Sivash]] from the Sea of Azov. Across the Black Sea to its west is [[Romania]] and to its south [[Turkey]].\n\nCrimea (or '''Tauric Peninsula''', as it was called from [[History of Crimea#Antiquity|antiquity]] until the [[early modern period]]) has historically been at the boundary between the [[Classical antiquity|classical world]] and the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]]. Its southern fringe was colonised by the [[Greek colonies|Greeks]], the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], the [[Roman Crimea|Romans]], the [[Cherson (theme)|Byzantine Empire]], the [[Principality of Theodoro|Crimean Goths]], the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while at the same time its interior was occupied by a changing cast of invading [[steppe nomads]] and empires, such as the [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Goths]], [[Alans]], [[Bulgars]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Kipchaks]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. Crimea and adjacent territories were united in the [[Crimean Khanate]] during the 15th to 18th century.\n\nIn 1783, Crimea was [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexed by the Russian Empire]] as the result of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)]]. Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, Crimea became an [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|autonomous republic]] within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]. During [[World War II]], Crimea was downgraded to the [[Crimean Oblast]] after its entire indigenous population, the [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|were deported to Central Asia]], an act recognized as a genocide. In 1954, it was [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred to the Ukrainian SSR]] from the [[Russian SFSR]].<ref>[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/why-did-russia-give-away-crimea-sixty-years-ago?gclid=CLHnyZC7ndACFSLicgod-UEIXw Why Did Russia Give Away Crimea Sixty Years Ago?], Mark Kramer, [[The Wilson Center]], 19 March 2014</ref>\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union, [[Ukraine]] was reestablished as an independent state in 1991, and most of the peninsula was reorganized as the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]], while the city of [[Sevastopol]] retained its special status within Ukraine.

Contemporaneously, and possibly because of the migration, the region came within the sphere of Greek maritime interest and became the site of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greek colonies]]. The most important Greek city was [[Chersonesus (Crimea)|Chersonesos]] at the edge of today's Sevastopol.\n\nThe Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]], under [[Darius I]], expanded to Crimea as part of [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|his campaigns]] against the [[Scythians]] in 513 BC.\n\nThe peninsula, then under the control of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]], later became a client kingdom of the [[Roman Empire]] in 63 BC.\n\n===Medieval history===\nIn the 9th century CE, Byzantium established the [[Theme of Cherson]] to defend against incursions by the [[Rus' Khaganate]]. The Crimean peninsula from this time was contested between Byzantium, Rus' and [[Khazaria]]. The area remained the site of overlapping interests and contact between the early medieval Slavic, Turkic and Greek spheres. It became a center of [[Saqaliba|slave trade]]. [[Early Slavs|Slavs]] were sold to Byzantium and other places in Anatolia and the Middle-East during this period.\n\n===Mongol Conquest (1238-1449)===\nTrapezuntine [[Perateia]] had already been subjected to pressure from the Genoese and Kipchaks by the time [[Alexios I of Trebizond]] died in 1222 before the [[Mongol invasions]] began its western sweep through [[Volga Bulgaria]] in 1223. With them, control of the peninsula changed in 1238, as all but the Perateia of Crimea was incorporated into the territory of the Golden Horde throughout the 14th century CE. In the course of the 13th century CE, portions were controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]] and by the [[Republic of Genoa]], the Perateia soon became the [[Principality of Theodoro]] and [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|Genoese Gazaria]], respectively.\n\n===Crimean Khanate (1449\u20131783)===\n{{Main|Crimean Khanate}}\n{{further|Crimean Goths}}\nThe Crimean Khanate, a [[vassal state of the Ottoman Empire]], succeeded the Golden Horde and lasted from 1449 to 1783.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Brian Glyn Williams]]|title=The Sultan's Raiders: The Military Role of the Crimean Tatars in the Ottoman Empire|url=http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf|publisher=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|format=PDF|year=2013|page=27|accessdate=30 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021092115/http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf|archivedate=21 October 2013}}</ref> During the period of the Crimean Khanate the many pre-Catherine peoples, including Crimean Greeks, Italians, Goths, Cumans, and Kipchkaks of Crimea merged into the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] nation's Tat, [[Yaliboylu Tatars|Yaliboylu]], and Steppe (or Nogay) subgroups.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=11Y0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA448&dq=crimean+tatar+language&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibmeDjiZzPAhVr64MKHcj5CF0Q6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&q=crimean%20tatar%20language&f=false|title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: The New Volumes, Constituting, in Combination with the Twenty-nine Volumes of the Eleventh Edition, the Twelfth Edition of that Work, and Also Supplying a New, Distinctive, and Independent Library of Reference Dealing with Events and Developments of the Period 1910 to 1921 Inclusive|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Company, Limited|year=1911|page=448}}</ref> The nobility of the Nogay subgroup gained much of their revenue and political power from the slave trade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf|title=The Sultan's Raiders: The Military Role of the Crimean Tatars in the Ottoman Empire|author=Brian Glyn Williams|date=2013|website=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|page=27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021092115/http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf|archivedate=21 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Russian Empire (1783\u20131917)===\n{{see also|New Russia|Taurida Governorate}}\nIn 1774, the Khanate was proclaimed independent under the [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] with the Ottomans,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/hist/eia/documents_archive/kucuk-kaynarca.php |title=Treaty of Peace (K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca), 1774|work=nus.edu.sg|date=20 November 2014|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> but was then [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|conquered by the Russian Empire in 1783]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runivers.ru/bookreader/book9829/#page/891/mode/1up|script-title=ru:\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438. \u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0435. \u0422\u043e\u043c XXI. 1781 \u2013 1783 \u0433\u0433.|trans-title=Complete Collection of Laws of the Russian Empire.

Crimea is almost an island and only connected to the continent by the [[Isthmus of Perekop]], a strip of land about {{convert|5|\u2013|7|km|mi|1}} wide.\n\nMuch of the natural border between the Crimean Peninsula and the Ukrainian mainland comprises the [[Sivash]] or \"Rotten Sea\", a large system of shallow lagoons stretching along the western shore of the Sea of Azov. Besides the [[isthmus of Perekop]], the peninsula is connected to the Kherson Oblast's [[Henichesk Raion]] by bridges over the narrow Chonhar and [[Henichesk Strait|Henichesk]] straits and over Kerch Strait to the [[Krasnodar Krai]]. The northern part of [[Arabat Spit]] is administratively part of Henichesk Raion in Kherson Oblast, including its two rural communities of [[Shchaslyvtseve]] and [[Strilkove]].

It was often fortified and sometimes garrisoned by the Turks. The [[North Crimean Canal]] now crosses it to bring water from the Dnieper. To the west [[Karkinit Bay]] separates the [[Tarkhankut Peninsula]] from the mainland. On the north side of the peninsula is [[Chernomorskoe]]/Kalos [[Liman (landform)|Limen]]. On the south side is the large [[Donuzlav]] Bay and the port and ancient Greek settlement of Eupatoria/[[Yevpatoria]]/Kerkinitis/Gozleve. The coast then runs south to [[Sevastopol]]/[[Chersonesus]], a good natural harbor, great naval base and the largest city on the peninsula. At the head of [[Sevastopol Bay]] stands [[Inkermann]]/Kalamita. South of Sevastopol is the small [[Heracles Peninsula]].\n\n'''South:''' In the south, between the [[Crimean Mountains]] and the sea runs a narrow coastal strip which was [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|held by the Genoese]] and (after 1475) by the Turks. Under Russian rule it became a kind of [[riviera]]. In Soviet times the many palaces were replaced{{by whom|date=July 2019}} with [[dacha]]s and health resorts. From west to east are: [[Heracles Peninsula]]; [[Balaklava]]/Symbalon/Cembalo, a smaller natural harbor south of Sevastopol; [[Foros, Crimea|Foros]], the southernmost point; [[Alupka]] with the [[Vorontsov Palace (Alupka)]]; [[Gaspra]]; [[Yalta]]; [[Gurzuf]]; [[Alushta]]. Further east is [[Sudak]]/Sougdia/Soldaia with its Genoese fort. Further east still is Kaffa/Theodosia/[[Feodosia]], once a great [[slave market|slave-mart]] and a kind of capital for the Genoese and Turks. Unlike the other southern ports, Feodosia has no mountains to its north. At the east end of the {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} [[Kerch Peninsula]] is [[Kerch]]/[[Panticapaeum]], once the capital of the [[Bosporian Kingdom]]. Just south of Kerch the new [[Crimean Bridge]] (opened in 2018) connects Crimea to the [[Taman Peninsula]].\n\n'''Sea of Azov:''' There is little on the south shore. The west shore is marked by the [[Arabat Spit]]. Behind it is the [[Syvash]] or \"Putrid Sea\", a system of lakes and marshes which in the far north extend west to the Perekop Isthmus. Road- and rail-bridges cross the northern part of Syvash.\n\n'''Interior:''' Most of the former capitals of Crimea stood on the north side of the mountains. [[Mangup]]/Doros (Gothic, Theodoro). [[Bakhchisarai]] (1532-1783).\nSoutheast of Bakhchisarai is the cliff-fort of [[Chufut-Kale]]/Qirq Or which was used in more warlike times. [[Simferopol]]/Ak-Mechet, the modern capital. [[Karasu-Bazar]]/Bilohorsk was a commercial center. Solkhat/[[Stary Krym]] was the old Tatar capital. Towns on the northern steppe area are all modern, notably [[Dzhankoy]], a major road- and rail-junction.\n\n'''Rivers:''' The longest is the [[Salhir River]] which rises southeast of Simferopol and flows north and northeast to the Sea of Azov. The [[Alma River (Crimea)|Alma River]] flows west to reach the Black Sea between Eupatoria and Sevastopol. The shorter [[Chornaya River (Crimea)]] flows west to Sevastopol Bay.\n\n'''Nearby:''' East of the Kerch Strait the Ancient Greeks founded colonies at [[Phanagoria]] (at the head of [[Taman Bay]]), [[Hermonassa]] (later Tmutarakan and [[Taman, Russia|Taman]]), [[Gorgippia]] (later a Turkish port and now Anapa). At the northeast point of the Sea of Azov at the mouth of the Don River were [[Tanais]], Azak/[[Azov]] and now [[Rostov-on-Don]]. North of the peninsula the Dnieper turns westward and enters the Black Sea through the east-west [[Dnieper-Bug Estuary]] which also receives the Bug River. At the mouth of the Bug stood [[Olvia]]. At the mouth of the estuary is [[Ochakiv]]. [[Odessa]] stands where the coast turns southwest. Further southwest is [[Tyras]]/Akkerman/[[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]].\n\n[[File:Kanaka. Crimea.
