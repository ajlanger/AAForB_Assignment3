Smith's poem was published in ''The Examiner'' three weeks after Shelley's, on February 1, 1818. Both poems explore the fate of history and the ravages of time: even the greatest men and the empires they forge are impermanent, their legacies fated to decay into oblivion.\n\nIn antiquity, Ozymandias ({{lang|grc|\u1f48\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03cd\u03b1\u03c2}}) was a Greek name for the Egyptian pharaoh [[Ramesses II]]. Shelley began writing his poem in 1817, soon after the [[British Museum]]'s announcement that they had acquired a large fragment of a statue of Ramesses II from the 13th century [[BCE]]; some scholars believe Shelley was inspired by the acquisition. The {{convert|7.25|ST|t kg|adj=on}} fragment of the statue's head and torso had been removed in 1816 from the [[mortuary temple]] of Ramesses (the [[Ramesseum]]) at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] by the Italian adventurer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]]. It had been expected to arrive in London in 1818, but did not arrive until 1821.<ref>British Museum.

At this time, members of Shelley's literary circle would sometimes challenge each other to write competing sonnets on a common subject: Shelley, [[John Keats]] and [[Leigh Hunt]] wrote competing sonnets on the Nile around the same time. Shelley and Smith both chose a passage from the writings of the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], which described a massive Egyptian statue and quoted its inscription: \"King of Kings Ozymandias am I. If any want to know how great I am and where I lie, let him outdo me in my work.\" In the poem Diodorus becomes \"a traveller from an antique land.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Siculus|first1=Diodorus|title=Bibliotheca Historica|location=1.47.4|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+1.47&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0540}}</ref>\n\nThe two poems were later printed in Leigh Hunt's ''The Examiner'',<ref name=\"Shelley1818\" /> a weekly paper published by Leigh's brother [[John Hunt (publisher)|John Hunt]] in London.

Smith's poem was published in ''The Examiner'' three weeks after Shelley's, on February 1, 1818. Both poems explore the fate of history and the ravages of time: even the greatest men and the empires they forge are impermanent, their legacies fated to decay into oblivion.\n\nIn antiquity, Ozymandias ({{lang|grc|\u1f48\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03cd\u03b1\u03c2}}) was a Greek name for the Egyptian pharaoh [[Ramesses II]]. Shelley began writing his poem in 1817, soon after the [[British Museum]]'s announcement that they had acquired a large fragment of a statue of Ramesses II from the 13th century [[BCE]]; some scholars believe Shelley was inspired by the acquisition. The {{convert|7.25|ST|t kg|adj=on}} fragment of the statue's head and torso had been removed in 1816 from the [[mortuary temple]] of Ramesses (the [[Ramesseum]]) at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] by the Italian adventurer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]]. It had been expected to arrive in London in 1818, but did not arrive until 1821.<ref>British Museum.

At this time, members of Shelley's literary circle would sometimes challenge each other to write competing sonnets on a common subject: Shelley, [[John Keats]] and [[Leigh Hunt]] wrote competing sonnets on the Nile around the same time. Shelley and Smith both chose a passage from the writings of the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], which described a massive Egyptian statue and quoted its inscription: \"King of Kings Ozymandias am I. If any want to know how great I am and where I lie, let him outdo me in my work.\" In the poem Diodorus becomes \"a traveller from an antique land.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Siculus|first1=Diodorus|title=Bibliotheca Historica|location=1.47.4|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+1.47&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0540}}</ref>\n\nThe two poems were later printed in Leigh Hunt's ''The Examiner'',<ref name=\"Shelley1818\" /> a weekly paper published by Leigh's brother [[John Hunt (publisher)|John Hunt]] in London.
