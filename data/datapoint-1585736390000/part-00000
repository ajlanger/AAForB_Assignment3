Lupin threatens to steal five of England's most prized treasures in hopes to humble the \"vanity\" of the English, and leaves a riddle containing information on what his first crime will be. Holmes and Watson determine that the theft will take place at the [[National Gallery]], and upon arriving there deduce that the object will be ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'', which is symbolic of Britain\u2019s victory over France and Spain in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. They alert the Museum Director and [[Inspector Lestrade]] who has the Gallery guarded at every entrance. However, the next the morning, they find the guards knocked out and the painting stolen. Holmes learns that Lupin disguised himself as a visiting French painter named Horace Velmont, and hid himself before Lestrade arrived. Lupin leaves behind a letter with a clue as to where he will strike next. \n[[File:SH4 - Le British Museum.png|thumb|left|The British Museum as it appears in the game]]\nHolmes and Watson head to the [[Tower of London]], were they believe Lupin will steal [[Ravens of the Tower of London|the ravens]]. They arrived too late, as the ravens are reported missing and replaced with other individual birds and a bat which have been let lose. They capture the animals and find pieces of paper attached to them. From the messages in the papers, Holmes deduces what Lupin will do next. Holmes and Watson meet with Lestrade and the Prime Minister at the [[British Museum]] where Holmes informs then that Lupin tends to steal the [[Rosetta Stone]], which was taken by Britain from the French. Lestrade once again has the Museum guarded at every entrance but Lupin still manages to steal the stone right in front of them using ropes. He leaves behind yet another letter.\n\nHolmes determines that someone had unwittingly helped Lupin pass the security system. Unknown to him, Watson had befriended a journalist named Piers Urquhart Alenn who he helped into the museum to pay him back for favors. Watson soon confesses and Holmes deduces, to his horror, that Lupin\u2019s next target will be [[Queen Victoria]] herself. At [[Buckingham Palace]], Holmes and Watson find that the Prime Minister has had the place guarded heavily. Holmes learns that a French [[grandfather clock]] (which has a cupboard) was delivered to the queen\u2019s chamber and correctly deduces that Lupin made it to the queen. Lupin, however, does not hurt the queen but asks for a kiss which she obliges. She then allows him to use her secret corridor to escape. Holmes persuades Lupin but only manages to find another letter which clues to his next and final crime.\n\nThe Prime Minister congratulates Holmes and Watson for their role in protecting the Queen and asks Watson to decipher Lupin\u2019s message. Watson initially deduces that the next crime will be at the Tower of London but the Prime Minister reminds him that Lupin already struck there. Watson then determines that the final target will be [[Big Ben]]. Watson joins the Prime Minister, Lestrade and much of [[Scotland Yard]] to wait for Lupin there but Holmes goes to the Tower of London. He learns that Lupin\u2019s past four crimes were distractions from his real target, the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewel]]s. Holmes sabotages Lupin\u2019s plan and confronts him. The two express their mutual admiration for each other. Lupin agrees to return the stolen items and Holmes lets him go, knowing they will not he each other again. Holmes later tells Watson not to write about this endeavor.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Sherlock Holmes Versus Ars\u00e8ne Lupin'' is an adventure played from a first person perspective. The player character for the majority of the game is Holmes, though some sections feature Watson and one features Inspector Lestrade. Most of the areas in which the game takes place are based on famous London landmarks, including the [[National Gallery]] and [[British Museum]], the former of which features scanned copies of dozens of famous paintings, as well as numerous historical artifacts. Solving the mysteries of the game involve examining locations and discovering clues.\n\nRetaining the first-person interface and gameplay of ''The Awakened'', the game follows Holmes and Watson as Holmes as they try to stop Lupin.<ref name=frogwares/> It is the first in the series to feature a cat-and-mouse style plot, a structure which would be retained for ''[[Sherlock Holmes Versus Jack the Ripper]]''.\n\n==Remastered edition==\nOn May 18, 2010, Frogwares released a remastered version of ''Sherlock Holmes Versus Ars\u00e8ne Lupin''. This version adds the option of a third person perspective, as well as walking animations for the sections of the game in which Holmes and Watson are together. The version of the game downloadable from [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[GOG.com|GOG]] has been updated to include these changes as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frogwares.com/blog/sherlock-holmes-vs-arsene-lupin-remstared/|title=''Sherlock Holmes versus'' Arsene Lupin now Remastered''|archivedate=10 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210124424/http://www.frogwares.com/blog/sherlock-holmes-vs-arsene-lupin-remstared/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 73.41% (31 reviews) <ref>{{cite web|title=Aggregate score|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/935956-sherlock-holmes-the-awakened/index.html|accessdate=22 August 2008}}</ref>\n| MC = 71% (28 reviews) <ref name=\"metacritic\">{{cite web|title=Sherlock Holmes: Nemesis for PC Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-nemesis|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 6.0 of 10 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://asia.gamespot.com/sherlock-holmes-nemesis/reviews/sherlock-holmes-nemesis-review-6190711/|title=Xbox review|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=22 August 2008|archivedate=11 January 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111091224/http://asia.gamespot.com/sherlock-holmes-nemesis/reviews/sherlock-holmes-nemesis-review-6190711|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| GRadar = 5/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/sherlock-holmes-nemesis/|title=Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper review, Sherlock Holmes versus Arsene Lupin Review, PC Reviews|publisher=Games Radar.com|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref>\n| GameZone = 7.3/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/reviews/sherlock_holmes_nemesis_pc_review|title=Sherlock Holmes versus Arsene Lupin review, Sherlock Holmes versus Arsene Lupin Review, PC Reviews|publisher=GameZone|accessdate=17 May 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415003204/http://pc.gamezone.com/reviews/sherlock_holmes_nemesis_pc_review|archivedate=15 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| IGN = 7.0 of 10 <ref>{{cite web|title=Xbox review|website=[[IGN]]|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/23/sherlock-holmes-nemesis-review|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n}}\nThe first four ''Sherlock Holmes'' titles from Frogwares\u2014''[[Sherlock Holmes: Mystery of the Mummy|Mummy]]'', ''[[Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Silver Earring|Silver Earring]]'', ''[[Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened|The Awakened]]'' and ''Nemesis''\u2014totaled roughly 1.5 million global sales by February 2009.<ref name=15m>{{cite press release | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714222459/https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/sherlock-holmes-vs--jack-the-ripper-frogwares-lets-rip-with-a-new-set-of-screenshots | url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/sherlock-holmes-vs--jack-the-ripper-frogwares-lets-rip-with-a-new-set-of-screenshots | title=''Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper'' | publisher=[[GamesIndustry.biz]] | archivedate=July 14, 2018 | date=February 19, 2009 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n''Sherlock Holmes Versus Ars\u00e8ne Lupin '' has received mixed reviews on review aggregator [[Metacritic]],<ref name=metacritic/> with a score of 71 out of 100.
