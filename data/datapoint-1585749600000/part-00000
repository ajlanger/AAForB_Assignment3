It is located approximately {{Convert|8|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the city centre. In 2017, 8&nbsp;million passengers passed through the airport, making it [[Busiest airports in Malaysia|the second busiest airport in Malaysia]] after [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]]. A medium-sized airport with good connections to most major aviation hubs across the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, the airport serves the city of Kota Kinabalu as well as the entire west coast of Sabah.\n\n==History==\nThe airport began as a [[Airbase|military airfield]] built by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"dca\" /> It was then known as '''Jesselton Airfield''' (Kota Kinabalu was known as Jesselton at the time). Towards the end of the war, it suffered severe bombings by [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paul.rutgers.edu/~mcgrew/wwii/usaf/html/Jul.45.html|title=USAAF Chronology:|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) of North Borneo (now Sabah) took over the operation and maintenance of the airport. In 1957, the original grass strip runway was resurfaced with [[bitumen]] material and a new terminal was built.<ref name=\"dca\">[http://www.dca.sabah.gov.my/profile.php Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205346/http://www.dca.sabah.gov.my/profile.php|date=27 September 2007}}, ''Department of Civil Aviation, Sabah''. Accessed 10 April 2007.</ref> By 1959, the runway had been extended to 1,593 metres to enable the operation of [[Malayan Airways]]' turboprop [[Vickers Viscount|Viscount aircraft]]. In 1963, the runway was further reinforced and lengthened to 1,921 meters to cater for [[De Havilland Comet|Comet 4]] jet operations. Commercial flights and passenger arrivals gradually increased and a larger terminal building was needed. By 1967, [[Cathay Pacific Airways]] had begun operating a twice-weekly [[Convair 880]] jet service between the airport and Hong Kong with an intermediate stop in Manila.<ref>timetableimages.com, Cathay Pacific 16 April 1967 system timetable</ref>\n\nIn 1969, a British consultancy firm was appointed to formulate a Master Plan for a phased and organised development of KKIA over the next few decades. The master plan was submitted to the government with recommendations to:\n* reinforce and extend the runway to 2,987 metres to cater for [[Boeing 707]] and 747 jet operations\n* build a new terminal complex and parallel taxiway connecting to the runway\n* provide navigation equipment, communication facilities and a modern light system for the runway\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a new terminal building was built on the other side of the runway from the original terminal. Almost all commercial flights were shifted to this newer and larger terminal. Subsequently, the original terminal became known as the ''Airport Lama'' (\"Old Airport\"). In 1992, the DCA of Sabah was corporatised and [[Malaysia Airports|Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad]] took over the management and operations of the airport.<ref name=\"dca\" /> A further expansion project for both terminals began in 2006, and in January 2007 the original terminal was rebranded Terminal 2 whilst the newer terminal became known as Terminal 1.\n\nTerminal 2 was closed on 1 December 2015 and all airlines shifted their operations to Terminal 1.<ref name=\"T2close\">{{cite news |last=Sario|first=Ruben|date=30 November 2015|title=KKIA Terminal 2 to close from midnight|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/data/stories/2015/11/30/09/10/terminal-2-kkia/|newspaper=The Star (Malaysia)|access-date=1 December 2015}}</ref> There are plans to use Terminal 2 for cargo operations and general aviation.<ref name=\"TheSun\">{{cite news |date=17 September 2015|title=Airasia must relocate from KKIA'S 'land-locked' terminal 2, says MAHB|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1555402|newspaper=The Sun Daily (Malaysia)|access-date=1 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Expansion and renovation==\nIn mid-2005, the Malaysian federal government approved major renovation and refurbishment works to the main terminal (Terminal 1) as well as a runway expansion project worth RM1.4&nbsp;billion.

It can be accessed via Jalan Kepayan, Jalan Lintas and Jalan Putatan located in the suburb or township of [[Kepayan]]. The terminal is capable of handling 9&nbsp;million passengers per annum and is equipped with the following facilities:\n* 64 check-in counters for international and domestic flights\n* 2 baggage x-ray check-in machines and 5 hand luggage x-ray machines (3 for departures, 1 for VIPs and 1 for staff)\n* 36 immigration counters (16 for departures and 20 for arrivals)\n* 6 baggage carousels\n* 3 floors (Ground floor: arrival hall, first floor: airline offices and local departures, second floor: check-in counters and domestic/foreign departures)\n* 9 aerobridges\n* 17 aircraft parking bays capable of accommodating wide and narrow body aircraft\n* 1,400 car parking bays\n\nThe Departure Hall column head design is inspired by the 'Wakid' basket design. A 'Wakid' is, in Sabahan tradition, a symbol of preparing for a meaningful journey. Some ethnic patterns of the Rungus and Bajau ethnic groups are also incorporated into the design of the floor tiles.\n\nThe first flight to depart at the new wing was MH2637 to [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Kuala Lumpur]] at 06:50 while the last flight at the old wing was at 00:25.

It is accessed via Jalan Mat Salleh in [[Tanjung Aru]] and is located on the other side of the runway from Terminal 1. Terminal 2 served charter and low-cost carriers, the main airline utilizing the terminal being [[AirAsia]].\n\nIn 2006, Terminal 2 underwent a major renovation and extension to accommodate low-cost carriers, reopening on 1 January 2007 in conjunction with ''Visit Malaysia Year 2007''. The works were completed 27 months ahead of schedule. It had 26 check-in counters for domestic and international flights and 6 parking bays for B737 and A320 aircraft as well as 7 luggage x-ray machines, a VIP room and 13 immigration counters. The terminal had the capacity to handle 3&nbsp;million passengers annually.<ref name=\"LCC\" />\n\nHowever, with limited expansion space and the congestion at Terminal 2, as well as to consolidate all airlines operations in one terminal, airlines at Terminal 2 was ordered to move to Terminal 1. The decision was opposed by AirAsia, and the airline refused to move despite a government directive to do so, missing the deadline five times as of 1 August 2015.<ref>{{cite news |last=Yeong|first=Eva|date=17 September 2015|title=AirAsia to stay put at KKIA Terminal 2|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1518441|newspaper=The Sun Daily (Malaysia)|access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> The issue was resolved when AirAsia agreed to move to Terminal 1 on 1 December 2015, and Terminal 2 was closed at midnight that day.<ref name=\"T2close\" /> The terminal will be converted for cargo, charter, VIP flights and general aviation use.<ref name=\"TheSun\" />\n\nThe Terminal currently serves for cargo operators such as Raya Airways and several General Aviation companies such as Weststar and Layang-Layang.

of [[Sabah]], Malaysia. It is located approximately {{Convert|8|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the city centre. In 2017, 8&nbsp;million passengers passed through the airport, making it [[Busiest airports in Malaysia|the second busiest airport in Malaysia]] after [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]]. A medium-sized airport with good connections to most major aviation hubs across the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, the airport serves the city of Kota Kinabalu as well as the entire west coast of Sabah.\n\n==History==\nThe airport began as a [[Airbase|military airfield]] built by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"dca\" /> It was then known as '''Jesselton Airfield''' (Kota Kinabalu was known as Jesselton at the time). Towards the end of the war, it suffered severe bombings by [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paul.rutgers.edu/~mcgrew/wwii/usaf/html/Jul.45.html|title=USAAF Chronology:|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) of North Borneo (now Sabah) took over the operation and maintenance of the airport. In 1957, the original grass strip runway was resurfaced with [[bitumen]] material and a new terminal was built.<ref name=\"dca\">[http://www.dca.sabah.gov.my/profile.php Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205346/http://www.dca.sabah.gov.my/profile.php|date=27 September 2007}}, ''Department of Civil Aviation, Sabah''. Accessed 10 April 2007.</ref> By 1959, the runway had been extended to 1,593 metres to enable the operation of [[Malayan Airways]]' turboprop [[Vickers Viscount|Viscount aircraft]]. In 1963, the runway was further reinforced and lengthened to 1,921 meters to cater for [[De Havilland Comet|Comet 4]] jet operations. Commercial flights and passenger arrivals gradually increased and a larger terminal building was needed. By 1967, [[Cathay Pacific Airways]] had begun operating a twice-weekly [[Convair 880]] jet service between the airport and Hong Kong with an intermediate stop in Manila.<ref>timetableimages.com, Cathay Pacific 16 April 1967 system timetable</ref>\n\nIn 1969, a British consultancy firm was appointed to formulate a Master Plan for a phased and organised development of KKIA over the next few decades. The master plan was submitted to the government with recommendations to:\n* reinforce and extend the runway to 2,987 metres to cater for [[Boeing 707]] and 747 jet operations\n* build a new terminal complex and parallel taxiway connecting to the runway\n* provide navigation equipment, communication facilities and a modern light system for the runway\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a new terminal building was built on the other side of the runway from the original terminal. Almost all commercial flights were shifted to this newer and larger terminal. Subsequently, the original terminal became known as the ''Airport Lama'' (\"Old Airport\"). In 1992, the DCA of Sabah was corporatised and [[Malaysia Airports|Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad]] took over the management and operations of the airport.<ref name=\"dca\" /> A further expansion project for both terminals began in 2006, and in January 2007 the original terminal was rebranded Terminal 2 whilst the newer terminal became known as Terminal 1.\n\nTerminal 2 was closed on 1 December 2015 and all airlines shifted their operations to Terminal 1.<ref name=\"T2close\">{{cite news |last=Sario|first=Ruben|date=30 November 2015|title=KKIA Terminal 2 to close from midnight|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/data/stories/2015/11/30/09/10/terminal-2-kkia/|newspaper=The Star (Malaysia)|access-date=1 December 2015}}</ref> There are plans to use Terminal 2 for cargo operations and general aviation.<ref name=\"TheSun\">{{cite news |date=17 September 2015|title=Airasia must relocate from KKIA'S 'land-locked' terminal 2, says MAHB|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1555402|newspaper=The Sun Daily (Malaysia)|access-date=1 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Expansion and renovation==\nIn mid-2005, the Malaysian federal government approved major renovation and refurbishment works to the main terminal (Terminal 1) as well as a runway expansion project worth RM1.4&nbsp;billion.

It can be accessed via Jalan Kepayan, Jalan Lintas and Jalan Putatan located in the suburb or township of [[Kepayan]]. The terminal is capable of handling 9&nbsp;million passengers per annum and is equipped with the following facilities:\n* 64 check-in counters for international and domestic flights\n* 2 baggage x-ray check-in machines and 5 hand luggage x-ray machines (3 for departures, 1 for VIPs and 1 for staff)\n* 36 immigration counters (16 for departures and 20 for arrivals)\n* 6 baggage carousels\n* 3 floors (Ground floor: arrival hall, first floor: airline offices and local departures, second floor: check-in counters and domestic/foreign departures)\n* 9 aerobridges\n* 17 aircraft parking bays capable of accommodating wide and narrow body aircraft\n* 1,400 car parking bays\n\nThe Departure Hall column head design is inspired by the 'Wakid' basket design. A 'Wakid' is, in Sabahan tradition, a symbol of preparing for a meaningful journey. Some ethnic patterns of the Rungus and Bajau ethnic groups are also incorporated into the design of the floor tiles.\n\nThe first flight to depart at the new wing was MH2637 to [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Kuala Lumpur]] at 06:50 while the last flight at the old wing was at 00:25. [[Malaysia Airlines]] is the main operating airline in this terminal.<ref>[http://www.azworldairports.com/airports/p2030bki.htm Kota Kinabalu International Airport], ''A-Z World Airports Online''.

It is accessed via Jalan Mat Salleh in [[Tanjung Aru]] and is located on the other side of the runway from Terminal 1. Terminal 2 served charter and low-cost carriers, the main airline utilizing the terminal being [[AirAsia]].\n\nIn 2006, Terminal 2 underwent a major renovation and extension to accommodate low-cost carriers, reopening on 1 January 2007 in conjunction with ''Visit Malaysia Year 2007''. The works were completed 27 months ahead of schedule. It had 26 check-in counters for domestic and international flights and 6 parking bays for B737 and A320 aircraft as well as 7 luggage x-ray machines, a VIP room and 13 immigration counters. The terminal had the capacity to handle 3&nbsp;million passengers annually.<ref name=\"LCC\" />\n\nHowever, with limited expansion space and the congestion at Terminal 2, as well as to consolidate all airlines operations in one terminal, airlines at Terminal 2 was ordered to move to Terminal 1. The decision was opposed by AirAsia, and the airline refused to move despite a government directive to do so, missing the deadline five times as of 1 August 2015.<ref>{{cite news |last=Yeong|first=Eva|date=17 September 2015|title=AirAsia to stay put at KKIA Terminal 2|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1518441|newspaper=The Sun Daily (Malaysia)|access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> The issue was resolved when AirAsia agreed to move to Terminal 1 on 1 December 2015, and Terminal 2 was closed at midnight that day.<ref name=\"T2close\" /> The terminal will be converted for cargo, charter, VIP flights and general aviation use.<ref name=\"TheSun\" />\n\nThe Terminal currently serves for cargo operators such as Raya Airways and several General Aviation companies such as Weststar and Layang-Layang. Recently, during a state event with many VIP's in attendance, private jets on charter were moved to Terminal 2 to avoid congestion aircraft parking bays on Terminal 1.
