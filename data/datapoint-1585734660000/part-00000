It changed its name to the '''British Union of Fascists and National Socialists''' in 1936 and, in 1937, to '''British Union'''. It was disbanded in 1940, after it was [[proscription|proscribed]] by the British government following the start of the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe BUF emerged in 1932 from the [[far-right politics in the United Kingdom|British far-right]], following the electoral defeat of its antecedent, the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. The BUF's foundation was initially met with popular support, and it attracted a sizeable following. The press baron [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]] was a notable early supporter. As the party became increasingly radical, however, support declined. The [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] Rally of 1934, in which a number of anti-Fascist protestors were attacked by the paramilitary wing of the BUF, the [[Fascist Defence Force]], isolated the party from much of its following. The party's embrace of [[Nazi]]-style [[anti-semitism]] in 1936 led to increasingly violent anti-fascist disruptions, notably the 1936 [[Battle of Cable Street]] in [[London]]'s [[East End]]. The [[Public Order Act 1936]], which banned political uniforms and responded to increasing political violence, had a particularly strong effect on the BUF whose supporters were known as \"Blackshirts\" after the uniforms they wore.\n\nGrowing British hostility towards [[Nazi Germany]], with which the British press persistently associated the BUF, further contributed to the decline of the movement's membership. It was finally banned by the British government in 1940 after the start of the Second World War, amid suspicion that its remaining supporters might form a pro-Nazi \"[[fifth column]]\". A number of prominent BUF members were arrested and interned under [[Defence Regulation 18B]].\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:History of British Fascism.png|thumb|Flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement.]]\n[[Oswald Mosley]] was the youngest elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP before [[crossing the floor]] in 1922, joining first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and, shortly afterwards, the [[Independent Labour Party]]. He became a minister in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Second MacDonald Ministry|Labour government]], advising on rising unemployment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1930, Mosley issued his Mosley Memorandum, which fused [[protectionism]] with a proto-[[Keynesianism|Keynesian]] programme of policies designed to tackle the problem of unemployment, and he resigned from the Labour party soon after, in early 1931, when the plans were rejected. He immediately formed the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], with policies based on his memorandum. Despite winning 16% of the vote at a by-election in [[Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashton-under-Lyne]] in early 1931, however, the party failed to achieve any other electoral success.<ref>{{cite book|last= Powell|first= David|date=2004|title=British Politics,1910-35 - The Crisis of the Party System|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ch22p6goYYkC&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181&dq=BUF+50,000+members#v=onepage|location=|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 9780415351065}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1931, the New Party became increasingly influenced by [[Fascism]].<ref name=\"Britaininthe1930s\"/> The next year, after a January 1932 visit to [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Italy]], Mosley's own conversion to fascism was confirmed. He wound up the New Party in April, but preserved its youth movement, which would form the core of the BUF, intact. He spent the summer that year writing a fascist programme, ''The Greater Britain'', and this formed the basis of policy of the BUF, which was launched on 1 October 1932.<ref name=\"Britaininthe1930s\">Thorpe, Andrew.

This anti-semitic emphasis and these high-profile resignations resulted in a significant decline in membership, dropping to below 8,000 by the end of 1935, and, ultimately, Mosley shifted the party's focus back to mainstream politics. There were frequent and continuous violent clashes between BUF party members and anti-fascist protesters, most famously at the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in October 1936, when organised anti-fascists prevented the BUF from marching through Cable Street. However, the party later staged other marches through the East End without incident, albeit not on Cable Street itself.\n\nBUF support for [[Edward VIII]] and the peace campaign to prevent a second [[World War II|World War]] saw membership and public support rise once more.<ref name=\"thurlow94\">Richard C.

Mosley later denounced Joyce as a traitor and condemned him for his extreme anti-semitism. The historian [[Stephen Dorril]] revealed in his book ''Blackshirts'' that secret envoys from the Nazis had donated about [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]50,000 to the BUF.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fenton|first1=Ben|title=Oswald Mosley 'was a financial crook bankrolled by Nazis'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1513465/Oswald-Mosley-was-a-financial-crook-bankrolled-by-Nazis.html|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nBy 1939, total BUF membership had declined to just 20,000. <ref name=\"thurlow94\"/> On 23 May 1940, the BUF was banned outright by the government and Mosley, along with 740&nbsp;other fascists, was interned for much of the Second World War. After the war, Mosley made several unsuccessful attempts to return to politics, such as via the [[Union Movement]].\n\n==Relationship with the Suffragettes==\nAttracted by \u2018modern\u2019 fascist policies, such as ending the widespread practice of sacking women from their jobs on marriage, many women joined the Blackshirts \u2014 particularly in depressed Lancashire. Eventually women constituted one-quarter of the BUF's membership.<ref name=\"Nigel, J 2004\"/>\n\nIn a January 2010 BBC documentary, ''Mother Was A Blackshirt'', James Maw reported that in 1914 [[Norah Elam]] was placed in a [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway Prison]] cell with [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] for her involvement with the [[Suffragette]] movement, and, in 1940, was returned to the same prison with [[Diana Mosley]], this time for her involvement with the fascist movement. Another leading suffragette, [[Mary Richardson]], became head of the women's section of the BUF.\n\n[[Mary Sophia Allen]] OBE was a former branch leader of the West of England Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). At the outbreak of the First World War, she joined the [[Women Police Volunteers]], becoming the WPV Commandant in 1920.

Mosley accompanied Elam to Northampton to introduce her to her electorate at a meeting in the Town Hall. At that meeting Mosley announced that \"he was glad indeed to have the opportunity of introducing the first candidate, and ... [thereby] killed for all time the suggestion that National Socialism proposed putting British women back into the home; this is simply not true.

Many felt the movement's energy reminded them of the suffragettes, while others felt the BUF's economic policies would offer them true equality \u2013 unlike its continental counterparts, the movement insisted it would not require women to return to domesticity and that the corporatist state would ensure adequate representation for housewives, while it would also guarantee equal wages for women and remove the marriage bar that restricted the employment of married women. The BUF also offered support for new mothers (due to concerns of falling birth rates), while also offering effective birth control, as Mosley believed it was not in the national interest to have a populace ignorant of modern scientific knowledge. While these policies were motivated more out of making the best use of women's skills in state interest than any kind of feminism, it was still a draw for many suffragettes.<ref>Martin Pugh, [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/04/why-the-british-union-fascist-movement-appealed-to-so-many-women.html \"Why the Former Suffragettes Flocked to British Fascism\"], ''Slate'', 14 April 2017.

It changed its name to the '''British Union of Fascists and National Socialists''' in 1936 and, in 1937, to '''British Union'''. It was disbanded in 1940, after it was [[proscription|proscribed]] by the British government following the start of the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe BUF emerged in 1932 from the [[far-right politics in the United Kingdom|British far-right]], following the electoral defeat of its antecedent, the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. The BUF's foundation was initially met with popular support, and it attracted a sizeable following. The press baron [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]] was a notable early supporter. As the party became increasingly radical, however, support declined. The [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] Rally of 1934, in which a number of anti-Fascist protestors were attacked by the paramilitary wing of the BUF, the [[Fascist Defence Force]], isolated the party from much of its following. The party's embrace of [[Nazi]]-style [[anti-semitism]] in 1936 led to increasingly violent anti-fascist disruptions, notably the 1936 [[Battle of Cable Street]] in [[London]]'s [[East End]]. The [[Public Order Act 1936]], which banned political uniforms and responded to increasing political violence, had a particularly strong effect on the BUF whose supporters were known as \"Blackshirts\" after the uniforms they wore.\n\nGrowing British hostility towards [[Nazi Germany]], with which the British press persistently associated the BUF, further contributed to the decline of the movement's membership. It was finally banned by the British government in 1940 after the start of the Second World War, amid suspicion that its remaining supporters might form a pro-Nazi \"[[fifth column]]\". A number of prominent BUF members were arrested and interned under [[Defence Regulation 18B]].\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:History of British Fascism.png|thumb|Flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement.]]\n[[Oswald Mosley]] was the youngest elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP before [[crossing the floor]] in 1922, joining first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and, shortly afterwards, the [[Independent Labour Party]]. He became a minister in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Second MacDonald Ministry|Labour government]], advising on rising unemployment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1930, Mosley issued his Mosley Memorandum, which fused [[protectionism]] with a proto-[[Keynesianism|Keynesian]] programme of policies designed to tackle the problem of unemployment, and he resigned from the Labour party soon after, in early 1931, when the plans were rejected. He immediately formed the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], with policies based on his memorandum. Despite winning 16% of the vote at a by-election in [[Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashton-under-Lyne]] in early 1931, however, the party failed to achieve any other electoral success.<ref>{{cite book|last= Powell|first= David|date=2004|title=British Politics,1910-35 - The Crisis of the Party System|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ch22p6goYYkC&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181&dq=BUF+50,000+members#v=onepage|location=|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 9780415351065}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1931, the New Party became increasingly influenced by [[Fascism]].<ref name=\"Britaininthe1930s\"/> The next year, after a January 1932 visit to [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Italy]], Mosley's own conversion to fascism was confirmed. He wound up the New Party in April, but preserved its youth movement, which would form the core of the BUF, intact. He spent the summer that year writing a fascist programme, ''The Greater Britain'', and this formed the basis of policy of the BUF, which was launched on 1 October 1932.<ref name=\"Britaininthe1930s\">Thorpe, Andrew.

This anti-semitic emphasis and these high-profile resignations resulted in a significant decline in membership, dropping to below 8,000 by the end of 1935, and, ultimately, Mosley shifted the party's focus back to mainstream politics. There were frequent and continuous violent clashes between BUF party members and anti-fascist protesters, most famously at the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in October 1936, when organised anti-fascists prevented the BUF from marching through Cable Street. However, the party later staged other marches through the East End without incident, albeit not on Cable Street itself.\n\nBUF support for [[Edward VIII]] and the peace campaign to prevent a second [[World War II|World War]] saw membership and public support rise once more.<ref name=\"thurlow94\">Richard C.

Many felt the movement's energy reminded them of the suffragettes, while others felt the BUF's economic policies would offer them true equality \u2013 unlike its continental counterparts, the movement insisted it would not require women to return to domesticity and that the corporatist state would ensure adequate representation for housewives, while it would also guarantee equal wages for women and remove the marriage bar that restricted the employment of married women. The BUF also offered support for new mothers (due to concerns of falling birth rates), while also offering effective birth control, as Mosley believed it was not in the national interest to have a populace ignorant of modern scientific knowledge. While these policies were motivated more out of making the best use of women's skills in state interest than any kind of feminism, it was still a draw for many suffragettes.<ref>Martin Pugh, [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/04/why-the-british-union-fascist-movement-appealed-to-so-many-women.html \"Why the Former Suffragettes Flocked to British Fascism\"], ''Slate'', 14 April 2017.

In his book ''[[Winter of the World]]'', the Battle of Cable Street plays a role and some of the characters are involved in the BUF or in the anti-BUF organisations.\n* The BUF is also in [[Guy Walters]]' book ''The Leader'' (2003), where Mosley is the dictator of Britain in the 1930s.\n* The British humorous writer [[P.
