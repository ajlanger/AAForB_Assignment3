He traveled on foot and occasionally on horseback (when someone would donate a horse) sometimes accompanied by his wife, Peggy Dow throughout what was then the United States. His journeys took him to Canada, England and Ireland, and once to the West Indies. He was usually well-received although there were exceptions. A fierce [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], Dow's sermons were often unpopular in the southern United States, and he frequently was threatened with personal violence.

When those clothes became so badly worn and full of holes that they were no longer capable of covering him, some person in the audience usually would donate a replacement. The donated clothes often were not the correct size for his skinny body. When he traveled, he carried no luggage other than a box of Bibles to be given away. Throughout most of his life, what little money he ever collected was either given away to the poor or used to purchase Bibles. In his later years, he did accumulate a bit of money from the sales of his autobiography and religious writings.
