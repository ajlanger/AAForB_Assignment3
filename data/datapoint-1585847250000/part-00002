Set in the pre-[[British Invasion]] 1960s, the series tells the story of Nick Foley, a self-made millionaire who adopts six orphan girls. Each episode included musical scenes of hit songs from the era performed by the girls integrated into the plot (with the lyrics modified to provide commentary on the storyline).\n\n==Plot==\nNick Foley ([[Joseph Bologna]]), the millionaire owner of Foley's Frozen Foods, is a streetwise [[New Jersey]]-born businessman with a [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] lifestyle. In the [[television film|TV movie]] [[Television pilot|pilot]] which launched the series, Foley attempts to develop a family man image by bringing a group of six orphaned girls, who were featured in a newspaper story, saying that they refused to be separated from each other to live in the mansion in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]] where he lives with his [[butler]], John Clapper ([[Douglas Seale]]). Foley does this to seal a business deal and does not intend to keep the girls permanently, but Foley's plans change as he grows attached to the girls, and he ends up adopting them permanently.\n\nThe adjustment is huge on both sides, as the girls acquire a new father with no parenting experience.  Having spent the past few years in a rundown [[orphanage]], the girls suddenly find themselves in a life of luxury (hence the series' title). The series follows the trials and tribulations of the girls and a man who has previously never loved anyone but himself, and often struggles to cope with his new family.\n\nIn the pilot for the series, Foley takes in a group of six girls; however, Foley only adopted five of them for the remainder of the series' run: Rose, 17; Diane, 16;  Marva, 15; Patti, 14; and Mickey, 8. The sixth girl, Nina, appears only in the pilot (after the pilot was produced, it was decided that six children was too many for the series cast, so Nina was written out of the series as having been reunited with her birth mother).\n\nThe series differed from regular comedy-dramas in that the girls would frequently burst into song to help explain their feelings or move along the plot. Each episode therefore contained at least two musical scenes with covers of popular songs from the early 1960's with the lyrics changed to provide commentary on the storyline of the episode.\n\n==Reception==\nPromoted with the tagline, \"If you liked ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', you'll like ''Rags to Riches''\", ratings for the series were not strong enough for its Friday night time slot, and NBC canceled the show part way through its second season.<ref>{{cite news|title=''Rags'': Moderately Rich; NBC Rips Off ''Annie'', Hits Easy Street|last=Shales|first= Tom |date=1987-03-09|newspaper=The Washington Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McNeil|first=Alex|title=Total Television: The Comprehensive Guide to Programming from 1948 to the Present|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1996|isbn=0-14-024916-8|page=683}}</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\n[[Mark Mueller]] wrote new comedic lyrics for existing hit songs from the '50s and early '60s that were featured in most episodes of both seasons of the show.
