{"title_page": "Homo duplex", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=April 2015}}\n\n'''Homo duplex''' is a  view promulgated by [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], a macro-sociologist of the 19th century, saying that a man on the one hand is a biological organism, driven by instincts, with desire and appetite  and on the other hand is being led by [[morality]] and other elements generated by society. What allows a person to go beyond the \"animal\" nature is the most common religion that imposes specific normative system and is a way to regulate behaviour.\n\nLeft unchecked the individualism leads to a lifetime of seeking to slake selfish desires which leads to unhappiness and despair. On the other hand collective conscience serves as a check on the will. This is created by socialisation. Highly anomic societies are characterized by weak primary group ties\u2014family, church, community, and other such groups.\n\n==Quotes==\n;\u00c9mile Durkheim\n<blockquote>\nFar from being simple, our inner life has something like a double centre of gravity.
