They are among the largest spiders of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Northern Europe]]. They were previously placed in the genus ''[[Tegenaria]]''.

Its coloration is mainly dark brown. On its sternum is a lighter marking, with three light spots on each side. The [[opisthosoma]] features a lighter middle line with six \"spots\" on each side. The giant house spider has the same coloration as the domestic house spider, ''[[Tegenaria domestica]]''; it has earthy tones of brown and muddy red or yellow. They also have conspicuously hairy legs, palps and abdomen. Despite its English name, this species is not the largest species in the genus (that being ''[[Tegenaria parietina]]''). The female body size can reach {{convert|18.5|mm}} in length, with males having a slightly smaller body at around {{convert|12|to|15|mm}} in length. The female leg span is typically around {{convert|45|mm}}. The leg span of the male is highly variable, with spans between {{convert|25|to|75|mm}} being common.\n\nIts eight eyes are of equal size and are arranged in two rows. As the eyes contain fewer than 400 visual cells, ''E.&nbsp;atrica'' can probably only distinguish light and dark.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe first description of a spider now assigned to this species was by [[Carl Ludwig Koch]] in 1843, under the name ''Tegenaria atrica''. Other supposedly different species were described later, including ''Tegenaria saeva''  by [[John Blackwall]] in 1844, ''Tegenaria duellica'' by [[Eug\u00e8ne Simon]] in 1875 and ''Tegenaria gigantea'' by [[Ralph Vary Chamberlin]] and [[Wilton Ivie]] in 1935.
