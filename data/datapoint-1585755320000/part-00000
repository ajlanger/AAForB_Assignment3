During a solo descent of [[Bluejohn Canyon]] in southeastern [[Utah]] he dislodged a boulder, pinning his right wrist to the side of the canyon wall.

He received his college degree from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], finishing with degrees in mechanical engineering and [[French language|French]], with a minor in [[piano]].<ref name=brhp/> At Carnegie Mellon, he served as a resident assistant, studied abroad, and was an active [[intramural sports]] participant.<ref name=cmu>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/commencement/event/main-ceremony/keynote.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513194526/http://www.cmu.edu/commencement/event/main-ceremony/keynote.html|url-status=dead|title=Speakers & Honorees-Commencement Weekend - Carnegie Mellon University<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=May 13, 2011}}</ref><ref name=brhp/>{{rp|343}} He also worked as a rafting guide during the summer.<ref name=brhp/>{{rp|42}}\n\nRalston worked as a mechanical engineer with [[Intel]] in [[Ocotillo, Arizona|Ocotillo]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] for five years, but found himself burned out by working in a large corporation. During his time as an engineer he had built up skills in mountaineering, and in 2002 he quit in order to climb [[Denali]]. He moved to [[Aspen, Colorado]] in order to pursue a life of climbing mountains.<ref name=brhp/>{{rp|72}}\n\nRalston began working towards his goal of climbing all of Colorado's \"[[fourteener]]s\" \u2014 peaks over {{convert|14000|ft|m|round=10}} altitude, of which there are 59 \u2014 solo and during winter (a feat that had never been recorded before). In 2003, he was caught in a Grade 5 [[avalanche]] on Resolution Peak, Colorado with his [[skiing]] partners Mark Beverly and Chadwick Spencer. No one was seriously injured, but his friends did not speak to him in the aftermath, causing him to reevaluate his approach to risk management.<ref name=brhp/>{{rp|141}}\n\n==Canyoneering accident==\nOn April 26, 2003, Aron Ralston was canyoneering alone through [[Bluejohn Canyon]], in eastern [[Wayne County, Utah|Wayne County]], [[Utah]], just south of the [[Horseshoe Canyon (Utah)|Horseshoe Canyon]] unit of [[Canyonlands National Park]]. While he was descending the lower stretches of the [[slot canyon]], a suspended boulder became dislodged while he was climbing down from it. The rock smashed his right hand, and then crushed his right hand against the canyon wall.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2010/11/aron-ralston-the-real-story.html | website=Los Angeles Times | title=Aron Ralston \u2013 the Real Story |publisher=The Times |date=May 3, 2003 |author1=Stephanie Simon |author2=J.

His efforts were futile as he was unable to free his arm from the 800&nbsp;lb (360&nbsp;kg) chockstone. After three days of trying to lift and break the boulder, the [[dehydrated]] and [[Delirium|delirious]] Ralston prepared to [[amputate]] his trapped arm at a point on the mid-[[forearm]] in order to escape. After having experimented with [[tourniquet]]s and having made exploratory superficial cuts to his forearm, he realized, on the fourth day, that in order to free his arm he would have to cut through the bones in it, but the tools available were insufficient to do so.<ref name=brhp/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1821786/aron-ralston-between-rock-and-hardest-place|title=Aron Ralston - Between a Rock and the Hardest Place|first=Mark|last=Jenkins|date=August 1, 2003|website=Outside Online}}</ref>\n\nAfter running out of food and water on the fifth day, Ralston decided to [[Urophagia|drink his own urine]]. He carved his name, date of birth and presumed date of death into the sandstone canyon wall, and videotaped his last goodbyes to his family. He did not expect to survive the night, but as he attempted to stay warm he began hallucinating and had a vision of himself playing with a future child while missing part of his right arm.

He did so, then amputated his forearm with his [[multi-tool]], using the dull two-inch knife and pliers for the tougher tendons. The process took an hour, during which time he used tubing from a CamelBak as a tourniquet, taking care to leave major arteries until last. The manufacturer of the multi-tool was never named, but Ralston said \"it was not a [[Leatherman]] but what you'd get if you bought a $15 flashlight and got a free [[Multi-tool|multi-use tool]].\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/nation/20030509climbernat2.asp|title=CMU grad describes cutting off his arm to save his life|accessdate=2007-03-21 | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=J.

During his time as an engineer he had built up skills in mountaineering, and in 2002 he quit in order to climb [[Denali]].

In 2003, he was caught in a Grade 5 [[avalanche]] on Resolution Peak, Colorado with his [[skiing]] partners Mark Beverly and Chadwick Spencer.

His efforts were futile as he was unable to free his arm from the 800&nbsp;lb (360&nbsp;kg) chockstone. After three days of trying to lift and break the boulder, the [[dehydrated]] and [[Delirium|delirious]] Ralston prepared to [[amputate]] his trapped arm at a point on the mid-[[forearm]] in order to escape. After having experimented with [[tourniquet]]s and having made exploratory superficial cuts to his forearm, he realized, on the fourth day, that in order to free his arm he would have to cut through the bones in it, but the tools available were insufficient to do so.<ref name=brhp/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1821786/aron-ralston-between-rock-and-hardest-place|title=Aron Ralston - Between a Rock and the Hardest Place|first=Mark|last=Jenkins|date=August 1, 2003|website=Outside Online}}</ref>\n\nAfter running out of food and water on the fifth day, Ralston decided to [[Urophagia|drink his own urine]]. He carved his name, date of birth and presumed date of death into the sandstone canyon wall, and videotaped his last goodbyes to his family.
