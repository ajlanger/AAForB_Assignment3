Often, in Asimov's scenarios, Multivac comes to assume formal or informal world power - or even Galactic-wide power. In \"[[The Last Question]]\" (1956) Multivac ends up by effectively becoming [[God]]. Still, in line with Asimov's positive attitude towards Artificial Intelligence, manifested in the \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\", Multivac's rule is in general benevolent and is not resented by humans. Isaac Asimov popularized robotics in a series of short stories written from 1938 to 1942. He famously postulated the [[Three Laws of Robotics]], plot devices to impose order on his fictional robots.<ref name=surgery />\n\n== 1960s ==\n[[File:HAL9000 Case.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|One of HAL 9000's interfaces]]\n\nIn 1964 ''[[Playboy]]'' published [[Arthur C.

On one day in 1975, all the phones in the world start ringing, a \"cry of pain\" from a newly born intelligence formed by satellite networks linked together, similar to a brain but with telephone switches playing the role of artificial neurons. After the AI flexes its control of military systems, the protagonists resolve to shut down the satellites, but it is too late: the satellites have stopped responding to the humans' ground control directives.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Youngs |first1=Ian |title=11 great authors who wrote for Playboy |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41426419 |accessdate=1 April 2020 |work=BBC News |date=28 September 2017}}</ref><ref>Arthur C.

Mike sides with prisoners in a successful battle to free the moon. Mike is a sympathetic character, whom the protagonist regards as his best friend; however, his retaining his enormous power after the Moon became independent was bound to cause considerable problems in later time, which Heinlein resolved by killing him off near the end of the Lunar Revolution.

Fearing Colossus' rigid logic and draconian solutions, the creators of Colossus try to covertly regain human control. Colossus silently observes their attempts then responds with enough calculated deadly force to command total human compliance to his rule. Colossus then recites a [[Three Laws of Robotics#Zeroth Law added|Zeroth Law]] argument of ending all war as justification for the recent death toll. Then Colossus offers mankind either peace under his \"benevolent\" rule or the peace of the grave. In ''[[Colossus: The Forbin Project]]'' (1970), a pair of defense computers, Colossus in the United States and Guardian in the Soviet Union, seize world control and quickly ends war using draconian measures against humans, logically fulfilling the directive to end war but not in the way their governments wanted.\n\nA comics story based on this theme was a two-issue ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' adventure written by [[Superman]] co-creator [[Jerry Siegel]], where the team battled [[Brainiac 5]]'s construction, [[Computo (comics)|Computo]].\n\nIn the 1966 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The War Machines]]'', supercomputer [[WOTAN]] attempting to seize control from the [[BT Tower|Post Office Tower]].\n\n[[Harlan Ellison]]'s Hugo-winning \"[[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]\" (1967) features a superintelligence that has gone mad due to its creators failing to consider what the soul-less computer would find amusing.
