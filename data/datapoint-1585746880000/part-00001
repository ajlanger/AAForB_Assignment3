It superseded the post-[[World War II]] provisional [[Small Constitution of 1947|Small Constitution]] of 1947, which in turn replaced the pre-war [[April Constitution of Poland|April Constitution]] of 1935. \n\nThe 1952 constitution introduced a new name for the Polish state, the [[Polish People's Republic]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'', PRL), replacing the previously used Republic of Poland (''Rzeczpospolita Polska''). The communist-led ''[[Sejm]]'' ([[legislature]]) was declared to be the highest state authority. The real source of supreme state power, the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR), was not regulated by the constitution; it was ruled by its own statute. The constitution legalized many practices that had been introduced in Poland, in the wake of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the [[Polish People's Army]] defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1944\u20131945, by Polish-communist governmental bodies, including the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (PKWN) and its successors.\n\nInstead of the traditional [[separation of powers]], the constitution introduced the Soviet concept of \"unity of the state's power\".<ref name=\"Cieplak\">{{Cite book|author=Cieplak, Tadeusz N. |chapter=Section 4.

In 1982, the [[State Tribunal (Poland)|State Tribunal]] (which also existed in the [[Second Polish Republic]]), the [[Constitutional Tribunal (Poland)|Constitutional Tribunal]], and the [[Polish Ombudsman|Ombudsman]] office were introduced.\n\n==Amendments==\n\nDuring its forty-five years of service, the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic was subject to many changes, with its text amended 24 times.\n\nThe most controversial amendment was that of 10 February 1976. The proposed amendment declared that Poland was a [[socialism|socialist]] country, the PZPR was the leading force in the building of socialism and Poland shared \"unshakable fraternal bonds\" with the [[Soviet Union]]. The amendment caused protests resulting in the [[Letter of 59]], asking for inclusion of [[human rights]] as stated in the [[Helsinki Accords]].<ref name=\"Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\">{{Cite book|author=Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski, Zbigniew A. |authorlink=Zbigniew Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski|chapter=Chapter 16.
