Weather modification in warfare has been banned by the [[United Nations]] under the [[Environmental Modification Convention]].\n\n==History==\nA popular belief in northern Europe that shooting prevents hail caused many agricultural towns to fire cannons without ammunition. Veterans of the [[Seven Years' War]], [[Napoleonic wars]], and the [[American Civil War]] reported that rain fell after every large battle. After their stories were collected in ''War and Weather'', the [[United States Department of War]] in the late 19th century purchased $9,000 of gunpowder and explosives to detonate them in Texas.

He discovered that many areas faced the problem of drought. Over 82 percent of Thai agricultural land relied on rainfall. Thai farmers were not able to grow crops for lack of water. The royal rainmaking project debuted on 20 July 1969 at his behest, when the first rainmaking attempt was made at Khao Yai National Park. Dry ice flakes were scattered over clouds. Reportedly, some rainfall resulted.

Cloud seeding entails spraying small particles, such as [[silver iodide]], onto clouds to affect their development, usually with the goal of increasing precipitation. Cloud seeding only works to the extent that there is already water vapor present in the air. Critics generally contend that claimed successes occur in conditions which were going to lead to rain anyway. It is used in a variety of drought-prone countries, including the [[United States]], [[China]], [[India]], and [[Russia]]. In [[China]] there is a perceived dependency upon it in dry regions, and there is a strong suspicion it is used to \"wash the air\" in dry and heavily polluted places, such as Beijing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Xueliang|last2=Fu|first2=Danhong|last3=Li|first3=Xingyu|last4=Hu|first4=Zhaoxia|last5=Lei|first5=Henchi|last6=Xiao|first6=Hui|last7=Hong|first7=Yanchao|date=February 2015|title=Advances in Cloud Physics and Weather Modification in China|url=https://journals-scholarsportal-info.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/pdf/02561530/v32i0002/230_aicpawmic.xml|journal=Advances in Atmospheric Sciences|publisher=SCIENCE PRESS|volume=32|issue=2|pages=230\u2013249|doi=10.1007/s00376-014-0006-9|via=Web of Science}}</ref> In mountainous areas of the United States such as the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada,<ref>Hunter, Steven M.

The substance is a [[polymer]] in powder form (a [[polyacrylic acid]] derivative) which reportedly has the ability to absorb 1,500 times its own weight in water. The theory is that the polymer is dropped into clouds to remove their moisture and force the storm to use more energy to move the heavier water drops, thus helping to dissipate the storm. When the gel reaches the ocean surface, it is reportedly dissolved. Peter Cordani teamed up with Mark Daniels and Victor Miller, the owners of a government contracting aviation firm [[AeroGroup]] which operated ex-military aircraft commercially. Using a high altitude B-57 Bomber, [[AeroGroup]] tested the substance dropping 9,000 pounds from the [[Martin B-57 Canberra|B-57]] aircraft's large bomb bay disbursing it into a large thunderstorm cell just off the east coast of Florida.

Cloud seeding entails spraying small particles, such as [[silver iodide]], onto clouds to affect their development, usually with the goal of increasing precipitation. Cloud seeding only works to the extent that there is already water vapor present in the air. Critics generally contend that claimed successes occur in conditions which were going to lead to rain anyway. It is used in a variety of drought-prone countries, including the [[United States]], [[China]], [[India]], and [[Russia]]. In [[China]] there is a perceived dependency upon it in dry regions, and there is a strong suspicion it is used to \"wash the air\" in dry and heavily polluted places, such as Beijing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Xueliang|last2=Fu|first2=Danhong|last3=Li|first3=Xingyu|last4=Hu|first4=Zhaoxia|last5=Lei|first5=Henchi|last6=Xiao|first6=Hui|last7=Hong|first7=Yanchao|date=February 2015|title=Advances in Cloud Physics and Weather Modification in China|url=https://journals-scholarsportal-info.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/pdf/02561530/v32i0002/230_aicpawmic.xml|journal=Advances in Atmospheric Sciences|publisher=SCIENCE PRESS|volume=32|issue=2|pages=230\u2013249|doi=10.1007/s00376-014-0006-9|via=Web of Science}}</ref> In mountainous areas of the United States such as the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada,<ref>Hunter, Steven M.

The substance is a [[polymer]] in powder form (a [[polyacrylic acid]] derivative) which reportedly has the ability to absorb 1,500 times its own weight in water. The theory is that the polymer is dropped into clouds to remove their moisture and force the storm to use more energy to move the heavier water drops, thus helping to dissipate the storm. When the gel reaches the ocean surface, it is reportedly dissolved. Peter Cordani teamed up with Mark Daniels and Victor Miller, the owners of a government contracting aviation firm [[AeroGroup]] which operated ex-military aircraft commercially. Using a high altitude B-57 Bomber, [[AeroGroup]] tested the substance dropping 9,000 pounds from the [[Martin B-57 Canberra|B-57]] aircraft's large bomb bay disbursing it into a large thunderstorm cell just off the east coast of Florida.

In [[ancient India]] it is said that yajna or vedic rituals of chanting mantras and offering were performed by [[rishis]] to bring sudden bursts of rain fall in rain starved regions. Some [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]], like some Europeans, had rituals which they believed could induce rain. The [[Finns|Finnish people]], on the other hand, were believed by others to be able to control weather. As a result, [[Viking]]s refused to take Finns on their oceangoing raids. Remnants of this superstition lasted into the twentieth century, with some ship crews being reluctant to accept Finnish sailors.\n\nThe early modern era saw people observe that during battles the firing of [[cannon]]s and other firearms often initiated precipitation.\n\nIn [[Greek mythology]], [[Iphigenia]] was offered as a [[human sacrifice]] to appease the wrath of the goddess [[Artemis]], who had becalmed the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] fleet at [[Avlida|Aulis]] at the beginning of the [[Trojan War]]. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Aeolus]], keeper of the winds, bestowed [[Odysseus]] and his crew with a gift of the four winds in a bag. However, the sailors opened the bag while Odysseus slept, looking for booty (money), and as a result were blown off course by the resulting gale.<ref>Homer, ''[[s:The Odyssey/Book X|The Odyssey]]'', book 10.</ref> In ancient Rome, the ''[[lapis manalis]]'' was a sacred stone kept outside the [[Servian Wall|walls of Rome]] in a temple of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].

If the rain was not forthcoming, the statue of St Peter was removed from the church and tossed into a river.\n\nIn the Jewish Scriptures, otherwise known as the Old Testament, it is recorded that Elijah in the way of judgement, told King Ahab that neither dew nor rain would fall until Elijah called for it.<ref>1 Kinks 17:1</ref> It is further recorded that the ensuing drought lasted for a period of 3.5 years at which time Elijah called the rains to come again and the land was restored.<ref>1 Kings 18</ref>The Christian Bible in the New Testament records Jesus Christ controlling a storm by speaking to it.<ref>Mark 4:39</ref>\n\nIn [[Islam]],Salat Al-Istisqa\u2019 (Prayer for Rain) is taken as recourse when seeking rain from God during times of drought.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.prayerinislam.com/guide-to-prayer/nafl-prayers/prayer-for-rain/ |title = Prayer for Rain (Salat Al-Istisqa')|date = February 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== In literature ==\n[[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune (franchise)|Dune]] series features weather control technology, mainly in the planets of [[Arrakis]], where the technology is used to assure for privacy from observation and in order to hide from the [[Organizations of the Dune universe|Imperium]] their true population and their plans to [[Terraforming|terraform]] the planet,  and in [[Chapterhouse (Dune)|Chapterhouse]], where the [[Bene Gesserit]] intend to turn the planet into a [[desert]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Global warming]]\n* [[Climate engineering]]\n* [[Extreme weather]]\n* [[Weather forecasting]]\n* [[Operation Popeye]]\n* [[Beijing Weather Modification Office]]\n* [[Project Cumulus]]\n* [[Alberta Hail Project]]\n* [[Chemtrail conspiracy theory]]\n* [[Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation]] (FIDO)\n* [[Project Stormfury]]\n* [[Water scarcity]]\n* [[Weather modification in North America]]\n* [[Land surface effects on climate]]\n*[[Environmental Modification Convention|Environmental Modification Conventions (ENMOD)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060221192253/http://csat.au.af.mil/2025/volume3/vol3ch15.pdf Weather as a Force Multiplier:, Owning the Weather in 2025 \u2013 August 1996 \u2013 Department of Defense]\n* [https://www.scribd.com/doc/2450461/Weather-Modification-During-Vietnam-War-Senate-Hearing-1974 US Senate Report on Weather Modification \u2013 1974]\n* [https://www.scribd.com/doc/2450202/Weather-Controls-Over-the-Fighting-During-the-Autumn-of-1918 Weather Controls Over the Fighting During the Autumn of 1918 ''The Scientific Monthly'', Vol. 8, No. 1.
