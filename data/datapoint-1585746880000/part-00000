It was removed from the Coast and Geodetic Survey and became a component of the [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA) as the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps (ESSA Corps) upon the establishment of ESSA on 13 July 1965. The ESSA Corps became the NOAA Corps as a component of NOAA when ESSA was abolished and NOAA simultaneously was created on 3 October 1970.

The Coast Guard is part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and has both military and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] duties. [[Title 14 of the United States Code|Title 14]] states that the Coast Guard is part of the armed forces at all times, making it the only branch of the military outside the Department of Defense. During a declared state of war, however, the President or Congress may direct that the Coast Guard operate as part of the Department of the Navy.<ref>{{usc|14|3}}</ref> The U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, along with the NOAA Commissioned Corps, operate under military rules with the exception of the applicability of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], to which they are subject only when militarized by executive order or while detailed to any component of the armed forces.<ref>{{Cite web|title=UCMJ S 802.

The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] is an additional reserve military component of the Army and Air Force, respectively, and is composed of National Guard units, which operate under [[Title 32 of the United States Code|Title 32]] and under state authority as the [[Army National Guard]] and [[Air National Guard]]. The militia that later became the National Guard was first formed in the [[Colony of Virginia]] in 1607 and is the oldest uniformed military force founded in the [[New World]]. The National Guard can also be mobilized by the President to operate under Federal authority through [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10]].

Uniformed officers of NOAA and PHS are paid on the same scale as members of the armed services with respective rank and time-in-grade. Additionally, PHS Officers are covered by the [[Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act]] and the [[Service Members Civil Relief Act]] (formerly the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act).\n\nPHS and NOAA consist of [[commissioned officer]]s only and have no [[warrant officer]] ranks or [[enlisted ranks]]. Commissioned officers of the PHS and NOAA may be militarized by the President.<ref>PHS is under Title 42 & 46 U.S.C.</ref> Because they are commissioned officers, they can be classified as [[prisoners of war]] under the [[Geneva Conventions]], if captured by a [[belligerent]] entity. The [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] (USC&GS), a predecessor to NOAA, originally began commissioning its officers so that if captured while engaged in battlefield surveying, they would be protected under the [[Law of Armed Conflict]] and could not be tried or executed as [[espionage|spies]]. The USC&GS Commissioned Officer Corps became the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps (ESSA Corps), upon the creation of the [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA) on 13 July 1965, then became the NOAA Corps upon the creation of NOAA on 3 October 1970. The PHS traces its origins to [[Marine Hospital Service|a system of marine hospitals]] created by \"[[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]]\", passed by Congress in 1798; it adopted a military model of organization in 1871.<ref>''[[United States Code]].

[[Title 14 of the United States Code|Title 14]] states that the Coast Guard is part of the armed forces at all times, making it the only branch of the military outside the Department of Defense.

The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] is an additional reserve military component of the Army and Air Force, respectively, and is composed of National Guard units, which operate under [[Title 32 of the United States Code|Title 32]] and under state authority as the [[Army National Guard]] and [[Air National Guard]]. The militia that later became the National Guard was first formed in the [[Colony of Virginia]] in 1607 and is the oldest uniformed military force founded in the [[New World]]. The National Guard can also be mobilized by the President to operate under Federal authority through [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10]].

Uniformed officers of NOAA and PHS are paid on the same scale as members of the armed services with respective rank and time-in-grade. Additionally, PHS Officers are covered by the [[Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act]] and the [[Service Members Civil Relief Act]] (formerly the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act).\n\nPHS and NOAA consist of [[commissioned officer]]s only and have no [[warrant officer]] ranks or [[enlisted ranks]]. Commissioned officers of the PHS and NOAA may be militarized by the President.<ref>PHS is under Title 42 & 46 U.S.C.</ref> Because they are commissioned officers, they can be classified as [[prisoners of war]] under the [[Geneva Conventions]], if captured by a [[belligerent]] entity. The [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] (USC&GS), a predecessor to NOAA, originally began commissioning its officers so that if captured while engaged in battlefield surveying, they would be protected under the [[Law of Armed Conflict]] and could not be tried or executed as [[espionage|spies]]. The USC&GS Commissioned Officer Corps became the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps (ESSA Corps), upon the creation of the [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA) on 13 July 1965, then became the NOAA Corps upon the creation of NOAA on 3 October 1970. The PHS traces its origins to [[Marine Hospital Service|a system of marine hospitals]] created by \"[[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]]\", passed by Congress in 1798; it adopted a military model of organization in 1871.<ref>''[[United States Code]].
