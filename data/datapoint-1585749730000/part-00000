A different branch, the [[Nanakpanthi|Nanakpanth]], follows the teachings of the Guru Granth Sahib, also known as the holy book of the Sikhs.

But the number of non-Muslim reserved seats were not increased from 10. Similarly, the number of seats in Provincial Assembly of Sindh and Punjab were increased from 100 to 159 and 240 to 363 respectively, but the non-Muslim reserved seats were not increased.<ref name=\"idsn.org\"/> Although a bill for increasing minorities' seats was introduced by [[Ramesh Kumar Vankwani]], it was not passed.<ref>https://www.dawn.com/news/1468051/bill-suggests-increasing-minorities-seats</ref> Political parties [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)]] party is against giving reserved seats for minorities.<ref>https://www.dawn.com/news/1473511</ref>\n\nIn 1980s [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia ul-Haq]] introduced a system under which non-Muslims could vote for only candidates of their own religion. Seats were reserved for minorities in the national and provincial assemblies. Government officials stated that the separate electorates system is a form of [[affirmative action]] designed to ensure minority representation, and that efforts are underway to achieve a consensus among religious minorities on this issue, but critics argued that under this system Muslim candidates no longer had any incentive to pay attention to the minorities. Hindu community leader Sudham Chand protested against the system but was murdered. In 1999, Pakistan abolished this system.\nHindus and other minorities achieved a rare political victory in 2002 with the removal of separate electorates for Muslims and non-Muslims. The separate electorate system had marginalized non-Muslims by depriving them of adequate representation in the assemblies. The Pakistan Hindu Welfare Association was active by convening a national conference on the issue in December 2000. And in 2001, Hindus, Christians, and Ahmadis successfully conducted a partial boycott of the elections, culminating in the abolishment of the separate electorate system in 2002. This allowed religious minorities to vote for mainstream seats in the National and Provincial assemblies, rather than being confined to voting for only minority seats. Despite the victory, however, Hindus still remain largely disenfranchised.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6367773.stm|title=Hindus feel the heat in Pakistan|date=2 March 2007|website=News.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, [[Ratna Bhagwandas Chawla]] became the first Hindu woman elected to the [[Senate of Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.india.com/news/world/after-1947-first-hindu-minority-woman-from-thar-to-become-senator-in-pakistan-2907286/|title=After 1947, First Hindu Minority Woman From Thar to Become Senator in Pakistan|date=21 February 2018|website=India.com}}</ref> Although there is reservation of seats for women in [[Pakistan National Assembly]], not a single seat was allotted for non-Muslim women till 2018.

Seats were reserved for minorities in the national and provincial assemblies. Government officials stated that the separate electorates system is a form of [[affirmative action]] designed to ensure minority representation, and that efforts are underway to achieve a consensus among religious minorities on this issue, but critics argued that under this system Muslim candidates no longer had any incentive to pay attention to the minorities. Hindu community leader Sudham Chand protested against the system but was murdered. In 1999, Pakistan abolished this system.\nHindus and other minorities achieved a rare political victory in 2002 with the removal of separate electorates for Muslims and non-Muslims. The separate electorate system had marginalized non-Muslims by depriving them of adequate representation in the assemblies. The Pakistan Hindu Welfare Association was active by convening a national conference on the issue in December 2000. And in 2001, Hindus, Christians, and Ahmadis successfully conducted a partial boycott of the elections, culminating in the abolishment of the separate electorate system in 2002. This allowed religious minorities to vote for mainstream seats in the National and Provincial assemblies, rather than being confined to voting for only minority seats.
