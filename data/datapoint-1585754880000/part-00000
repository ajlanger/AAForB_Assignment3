Spiner's first and only starring film role was in ''[[Rent Control (1984 film)|Rent Control]]'' (1984).

In 1986, he played a condemned soul in \"[[Dead Run (The Twilight Zone)|Dead Run]]\", an episode of the short-lived revival of [[Rod Serling]]'s series ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' on CBS. He made two appearances in season three (1986) of the situation comedy ''[[Mama's Family]]'', playing two different characters. Spiner's first and only starring film role was in ''[[Rent Control (1984 film)|Rent Control]]'' (1984). In the ''[[Cheers]]'' episode \"Never Love a Goalie, Part II\", he played acquitted murder suspect Bill Grand.

Although billed as the final ''Trek'' movie for the ''TNG'' cast, the ambiguous ending of ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' suggested a possible avenue for the return of Data.
