(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2020. This was the second season with [[Rik van de Westelaken]] as host. The location of the season was the [[Henan]] province in [[China|The People's Republic of China]], the second time the series had filmed in China, following [[Hong Kong]] in season 14. The season premiered on January 11, 2020. While the originally planned Live Finale aired with no audience on March 14, 2020. During the Reunion, Buddy Vedder was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac13,400.-. Vedder, alongside his runner-ups Miljuschka Witzenhausen and Nathan Rutjes, had successfully unmasked Rob Dekay as the Mole.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Mexico]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are 3 remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith the exception of the Black Exemption, that has been included throughout the series since its introduction in Season 14, there were no major twists added to the season. However, after 13 years since Season 7, this season was the second to end with four candidates competing in the Finale to unmask the Mole.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|{{ill|Rob Dekay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Buddy Vedder|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Miljuschka Witzenhausen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|[[Nathan Rutjes]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|{{nowrap|Second Runner-Up}}\n|-\n|{{ill|Leonie ter Braak|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|16\n|4th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Claes Iversen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|12\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Johan Goossens|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|10\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Jaike Belfor|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|6\n|7th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Tina de Bruin|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|8th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Anita Witzier|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|3\n|9th place\n|}\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

He gives everyone the option to either choose wisdom or luck by going through the left or right gate. Once the contestant has gone through the gate, they got a key and a note with a pattern of Chinese characters. When they went further ahead, they encountered a giant wall with more Chinese characters on it. The contestant then had to match the pattern on their note with the corresponding pattern on the wall. When they found their pattern, they got to open the box underneath, and if it was correct, there was a reward inside for them to keep.\n\nIf the contestant chose for luck, they got an 'exemption', which would automatically grant them a spot in the next round when used at the test. If the contestant chose for wisdom, they got a 'black exemption', which would disable all exemptions and jokers when used at any tests before the Finale.\n\n;'Beltegoed' (Calling Credit) - Max. \u20ac2,500.-\nThe contestants arrived at a local market in [[Sanmenxia]]. Scattered across the market are several [[Tablet computer|tablets]] with half banknotes on it. The contestants had to make pictures of them and combine them to whole banknotes to earn money. However, they had to use the mobile phones from the locals to take the pictures. Also, only ''one'' picture was allowed to be taken on each phone. After 20 minutes, the time is up and all correctly combined banknotes are counted and exchanged to money for the pot.\n\n\u20ac150 was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Parkeertarief' (Parking Fee) - Max. \u20ac2,100.-\nThe contestants are locked up in duos in the back of five different trucks. They had to free themselves by completing assignments in the truck. The trucks were labeled as '\u20ac', '2', '1', '0', and another '0'. When they managed to get out, they had to park the trucks next to each other in such a way, that the numbers form an amount to earn the most money for the pot (\u20ac2100).\n\n\u20ac20 was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 2 - Tegendraads===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 2 - Tegendraads\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 18 January 2020<br>Locations: [[Sanmenxia, Henan]]\n|-\n!

Every colour that is fired by Rik at the end of the assignment earns \u20ac500 for the pot.

In duos and one solo team, the contestants must ride in taxis with Chinese drivers who cannot speak Dutch or English. Each taxi has a cellphone that the teams can use to help translate instructions to their driver, however, the numbers on the phone would call Chinese Restaurants throughout Amsterdam. If each team arrived at the restaurant with their envelope, they earned money. If they arrived with no envelope, they earn nothing.

The group can only map out the village and envelopes using a chalkboard at the entrance. Hidden throughout the village are tubes of sand which is needed for the last contestant's entry into the village. If any of the contestants are not back at the village entrance within 5 minutes, any tubes of sand in their possession is removed from the assignment. Once the last contestant is ready to enter the village, Rik indicates which five envelopes they must collect to earn money, the twist is that all the names have been removed from the envelopes before the last contestant enters the village.

Throughout the time limit of 20 minutes, electric cars of various colours drive past the contestants, with various words of colours placed on the backs of each car (which are also in various colours). After the time limit, Rik asks the contestant who wrote down the group's observations three questions about the number of red cars, number of cars with the word 'red' on their back, and how many words were written in red.

The two remaining contestants stay by the map at the starting point and must direct the three cyclists over the phone to the coloured bicycles throughout the city. Starting on blue bicycles, each of the cycles must proceed to swap bicycles in the order of Blue, Orange, White, and lastly Green before returning to the start.

Once seated at the table, Rik informed the group that they would be answering 10 questions about their journey so far, with the goal of acquiring the most points.

Across the bridge stood 6 boxes with tubes in 5 of them. At the beginning of the assignment, the contestants could look once inside the tubes at their corresponding boxes to see the amount of money they held.

The boxes increase in amounts from \u20ac80.-, to a sixth box valued at \u20ac1,200.- that can hold 9 tubes.

After the first viewing, Rik revealed that in duos, the group must decipher the number sequence the children in the Martial Arts demonstration are performing, with the help of a number chart. After three more viewings of the demonstration, Rik approached the treasurer, Nathan, and asked if the other duo knew the answer. If the treasurer's judgment is correct, the group would earn \u20ac1,750.-. \n\nThe contestants failed the assignment and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Onder de Pannen?' (Under the Pans?) - Max. N/A\n\nThat evening in the Shi Jie Night Market in Luoyang, the contestants were tasked for form duos again between two food carts. They had two hours to prepare, cook, and sell Dutch food to the local marketgoers. For every transaction made, the group earned money for the pot. After the assignment was complete, the group found out that they had 49 successful transactions at \u20ac25 per transaction, however, as the game has no \u20ac5.- note, the group's winnings were rounded down to the nearest zero.\n\n\u20ac1,220.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Richtingsgevoel?' (Sense of Direction) - Max. \u20ac6,000.-\n\nThe final assignment took place at the Lijing Gate, where one at a time, the contestants met with Rik for one final offer. Along the top floor of the gate stood 6 doors in which the contestants could check to earn money. However, each contestant had to choose either to risk \u20ac500, \u20ac1,000, or \u20ac1,500 from the pot for the assignment. The Mole's voice is put through software to disguise themselves from the contestants. Once they have made their choice known to Rik, the Mole separates the money between 1 to 3 of the six doors and calls the contestant over the phone to tell them where they hid the money. The contestant must decide after every two doors to believe or distrust the Mole's instructions to check for money. The game continues until either all the money they risked is collected, or if the contestant has checked up to 3 doors of the six doors. Whatever money they managed to retrieve would be doubled and put back into the final pot.\n\nThe outcome of the assignment will be revealed during the live reunion at the end of the season.\n\nAfter the assignment, Rik informed the four contestants that they were indeed the finalists (to their surprise) and to prepare for their final test of the season.\n\n===Episode 10 - Finale===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 10 - Finale\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 14 March 2020<br>Locations: [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, Netherlands]]\n|-\n!

The finalists, Buddy, Miljuschka, Nathan, and Rob were gathered the morning of the Live Finale for the reveal of the Mole and the outcome of the final test back in Luoyang, Henan. With the final test being multiple choice out of 40 questions, in Third place was Nathan with a score of 34. Second place, Miljuschka, totaling up to 37 out of 40. At the announcement that Rob was the Mole, Buddy won the season with a final test score of an outstanding 39 out of 40.\n\nAfter the reveal of the Mole's identity, it was revealed that Rob managed to remove \u20ac300.- from the pot in the Mol Laser assignment. Despite his best efforts, the Finalists managed to earn \u20ac2,500.- for the pot during the final assignment, Richtingsgevoel. Leaving a grand total of \u20ac13,400 in the winner's pot for Buddy.\n\n==Mole Sabotage==\nRob's strategy as the Mole was to play up his superfan status of Wie is de Mol on and off camera to the annoyance of the production to throw off his fellow Candidates. His strategy worked as only on the final test did the other Candidates finally chose him as their Moles.\n\n'''Beltegoed:''' While the group were scattered throughout the market gathering local Chinese people to use their phones for the assignment, Rob would sabotage the tablets to display lower amounts of money for the group to photograph.\n\n'''Parkeertarief:''' Rob was informed that the truck he was locked in with Leonie would cause the group to earn a maximum of \u20ac200,- if they did not get out. So he delayed solving their puzzle until the time ran out. Luckily a second truck did not complete their assignment, thus the group only managed to earn \u20ac20,- for the assignment.\n\n'''Beeldig:''' Rob placed himself in the group that had to search for envelopes in this assignment. His goal was to make sure neither group collected the correct envelopes. Directing his group to incorrect statues as quickly as he could to make sure Minus money would be collected. In one instance he took out money from one of the correct envelopes (and hid it in his hat) to further reduce the group's earnings from the assignment.\n\n'''Verkeer(d):''' With Nathan as Treasurer selecting the group's roles in the assignment, Rob lucked out into the Traffic Guide position where he could give false directions over the radio phones to the drivers when he felt like it. In such a powerful position, he managed to make sure to keep the pot low by making sure only 7 out of the 10 cars were correctly driven and parked for a mere \u20ac320,-. His poor \"Etherdiscipline\" aided in delaying and confusing the Candidates further throughout the assignment.\n\n'''Lettergreep:''' Aware of which letters had to be found for the second stage of the assignment, Rob ran the first stage as a fanatical candidate and found 4 letters and the Question Mark. As the W was not found, that reduced the potential earning, and during the second stage, he let Leonie take charge in searching for the remaining money without helping behind the scenes.\n\n'''Voice Mol:''' While Buddy took charge of the measuring for this assignment, Rob would be on the other end of the measuring tape, pulling the tape further than necessary to fudge the certain distances. Once all the phones were found, he made sure that a certain distance was one meter off to make sure the group never called Rik.\n\n'''Alles Kenners:''' Rob volunteered to enter the village first, so that he could switch the correct envelopes with wrong envelopes. Further sabotage was that he searched for the sand vials for the timer and dig holes in the ground to hide them from the group, meaning less time for Nathan to search for the correct envelopes he had already sabotaged.\n\n'''Mol Laser:''' Rob managed to hide throughout the laser tag field against most of the candidates, however, when it came down to Nathan's battle against him, Nathan's antics scared Rob until he chose to be taken out instead of being caught and unmasked. In the end of the assignment, Rob managed to take out \u20ac300.- from the group's pot.\n\n'''Scherp Stellen:''' Having memorized the 15 photographs required for the assignment beforehand, Rob made sure that the others didn't remember the correct instructions; causing only 4 out of the 15 photographs to be correct at the end of the assignment.\n\n'''Cijferkunst:''' Knowing that Nathan as the treasurer would have an influential role at the end of the assignment, Rob avoided pairing up with him. Paired up with Buddy, who wanted to bait Rob into sabotaging, he let Buddy bait him into giving Rik the wrong answer and causing the assignment to fail. It was the moment that Buddy finally locked onto Rob as the Mole, as the group's main suspect Leonie had just been executed from the game.\n\n'''Richtingsgevoel:''' Using a voice muffler over a phone, Rob tried to use reverse psychology against Nathan, to no avail. Leading to Nathan reclaiming the money he risked. With Miljuschka, he chose to build trust to bluff her later, however she too didn't fall for his tricks. Eventually, when he got to Buddy he managed to fool him out of \u20ac500.-, the eventual total in the assignment led up to \u20ac2,500.-, out of a potential \u20ac4,500.-.\n\n==Hidden Clues==\n'''Episode 1 - Afgeschermd:''' In ''Beltegoed'', Rob made sure to point out the \u20ac20.- to indicate that he was the 20th Mole.\n\n'''Episode 5 - Aangeraakt:''' The Candidates and audience could have spotted the Mole in ''Lezen en Schrijven''. One of the fans in the park said \"The Mole is here\" when Rob was on the screen searching.\n\n'''Episode Titles:''' The titles throughout the season pointed out to Rob's sabotages, Episode 2 ''Tegendraads'', which translates to contrary, is shown when the wires in ''Kleur Werk'' near Rob and Claes were in the contrary direction than where they should have been. ''Misleid'' (Mislead) pointed to Rob's role as the Traffic Guide misleading the drivers. ''Aangeraakt'' (Touched) had Rob literally touch the letters M, O, L, in that order during the ''Lettergreep'' assignment.\n\n'''Verkeer(d):''' During the beginning of the assignment, taking the first, second, third, and fourth letters of the first four road signs shown on screen, the letters M, O, L, R would spell out Mol R. A subtle suggestion that Rob was the Mole.\n\n'''Mol Laser:''' Rob's confessionals during this assignment were presented as the Mol talking to his opponents. And during his turn in the assignment he called out each of his opponents during the battle.\n\n'''Episode 6 - Voor Geen Meter:''' Rik's introduction monologue in this episode made a direct reference to one of Rob's tattoos. \"De Mol is tevreden.\" (The Mole is satisfied.)

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2020. This was the second season with [[Rik van de Westelaken]] as host. The location of the season was the [[Henan]] province in [[China|The People's Republic of China]], the second time the series had filmed in China, following [[Hong Kong]] in season 14. The season premiered on January 11, 2020. While the originally planned Live Finale aired with no audience on March 14, 2020. During the Reunion, Buddy Vedder was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac13,400.-. Vedder, alongside his runner-ups Miljuschka Witzenhausen and Nathan Rutjes, had successfully unmasked Rob Dekay as the Mole.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Mexico]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are 3 remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith the exception of the Black Exemption, that has been included throughout the series since its introduction in Season 14, there were no major twists added to the season. However, after 13 years since Season 7, this season was the second to end with four candidates competing in the Finale to unmask the Mole.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|{{ill|Rob Dekay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Buddy Vedder|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Miljuschka Witzenhausen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|[[Nathan Rutjes]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|{{nowrap|Second Runner-Up}}\n|-\n|{{ill|Leonie ter Braak|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|16\n|4th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Claes Iversen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|12\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Johan Goossens|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|10\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Jaike Belfor|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|6\n|7th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Tina de Bruin|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|8th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Anita Witzier|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|3\n|9th place\n|}\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

He gives everyone the option to either choose wisdom or luck by going through the left or right gate. Once the contestant has gone through the gate, they got a key and a note with a pattern of Chinese characters. When they went further ahead, they encountered a giant wall with more Chinese characters on it. The contestant then had to match the pattern on their note with the corresponding pattern on the wall. When they found their pattern, they got to open the box underneath, and if it was correct, there was a reward inside for them to keep.\n\nIf the contestant chose for luck, they got an 'exemption', which would automatically grant them a spot in the next round when used at the test.

However, they had to use the mobile phones from the locals to take the pictures. Also, only ''one'' picture was allowed to be taken on each phone. After 20 minutes, the time is up and all correctly combined banknotes are counted and exchanged to money for the pot.\n\n\u20ac150 was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Parkeertarief' (Parking Fee) - Max. \u20ac2,100.-\nThe contestants are locked up in duos in the back of five different trucks.

In duos and one solo team, the contestants must ride in taxis with Chinese drivers who cannot speak Dutch or English. Each taxi has a cellphone that the teams can use to help translate instructions to their driver, however, the numbers on the phone would call Chinese Restaurants throughout Amsterdam.

Throughout the time limit of 20 minutes, electric cars of various colours drive past the contestants, with various words of colours placed on the backs of each car (which are also in various colours). After the time limit, Rik asks the contestant who wrote down the group's observations three questions about the number of red cars, number of cars with the word 'red' on their back, and how many words were written in red.

Across the bridge stood 6 boxes with tubes in 5 of them.

After the first viewing, Rik revealed that in duos, the group must decipher the number sequence the children in the Martial Arts demonstration are performing, with the help of a number chart. After three more viewings of the demonstration, Rik approached the treasurer, Nathan, and asked if the other duo knew the answer. If the treasurer's judgment is correct, the group would earn \u20ac1,750.-. \n\nThe contestants failed the assignment and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Onder de Pannen?' (Under the Pans?) - Max. N/A\n\nThat evening in the Shi Jie Night Market in Luoyang, the contestants were tasked for form duos again between two food carts.

After the assignment was complete, the group found out that they had 49 successful transactions at \u20ac25 per transaction, however, as the game has no \u20ac5.- note, the group's winnings were rounded down to the nearest zero.\n\n\u20ac1,220.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Richtingsgevoel?' (Sense of Direction) - Max. \u20ac6,000.-\n\nThe final assignment took place at the Lijing Gate, where one at a time, the contestants met with Rik for one final offer. Along the top floor of the gate stood 6 doors in which the contestants could check to earn money. However, each contestant had to choose either to risk \u20ac500, \u20ac1,000, or \u20ac1,500 from the pot for the assignment. The Mole's voice is put through software to disguise themselves from the contestants. Once they have made their choice known to Rik, the Mole separates the money between 1 to 3 of the six doors and calls the contestant over the phone to tell them where they hid the money. The contestant must decide after every two doors to believe or distrust the Mole's instructions to check for money. The game continues until either all the money they risked is collected, or if the contestant has checked up to 3 doors of the six doors.

The finalists, Buddy, Miljuschka, Nathan, and Rob were gathered the morning of the Live Finale for the reveal of the Mole and the outcome of the final test back in Luoyang, Henan. With the final test being multiple choice out of 40 questions, in Third place was Nathan with a score of 34. Second place, Miljuschka, totaling up to 37 out of 40. At the announcement that Rob was the Mole, Buddy won the season with a final test score of an outstanding 39 out of 40.\n\nAfter the reveal of the Mole's identity, it was revealed that Rob managed to remove \u20ac300.- from the pot in the Mol Laser assignment. Despite his best efforts, the Finalists managed to earn \u20ac2,500.- for the pot during the final assignment, Richtingsgevoel. Leaving a grand total of \u20ac13,400 in the winner's pot for Buddy.\n\n==Mole Sabotage==\nRob's strategy as the Mole was to play up his superfan status of Wie is de Mol on and off camera to the annoyance of the production to throw off his fellow Candidates. His strategy worked as only on the final test did the other Candidates finally chose him as their Moles.\n\n'''Beltegoed:''' While the group were scattered throughout the market gathering local Chinese people to use their phones for the assignment, Rob would sabotage the tablets to display lower amounts of money for the group to photograph.\n\n'''Parkeertarief:''' Rob was informed that the truck he was locked in with Leonie would cause the group to earn a maximum of \u20ac200,- if they did not get out. So he delayed solving their puzzle until the time ran out. Luckily a second truck did not complete their assignment, thus the group only managed to earn \u20ac20,- for the assignment.\n\n'''Beeldig:''' Rob placed himself in the group that had to search for envelopes in this assignment. His goal was to make sure neither group collected the correct envelopes. Directing his group to incorrect statues as quickly as he could to make sure Minus money would be collected. In one instance he took out money from one of the correct envelopes (and hid it in his hat) to further reduce the group's earnings from the assignment.\n\n'''Verkeer(d):''' With Nathan as Treasurer selecting the group's roles in the assignment, Rob lucked out into the Traffic Guide position where he could give false directions over the radio phones to the drivers when he felt like it. In such a powerful position, he managed to make sure to keep the pot low by making sure only 7 out of the 10 cars were correctly driven and parked for a mere \u20ac320,-. His poor \"Etherdiscipline\" aided in delaying and confusing the Candidates further throughout the assignment.\n\n'''Lettergreep:''' Aware of which letters had to be found for the second stage of the assignment, Rob ran the first stage as a fanatical candidate and found 4 letters and the Question Mark. As the W was not found, that reduced the potential earning, and during the second stage, he let Leonie take charge in searching for the remaining money without helping behind the scenes.\n\n'''Voice Mol:''' While Buddy took charge of the measuring for this assignment, Rob would be on the other end of the measuring tape, pulling the tape further than necessary to fudge the certain distances. Once all the phones were found, he made sure that a certain distance was one meter off to make sure the group never called Rik.\n\n'''Alles Kenners:''' Rob volunteered to enter the village first, so that he could switch the correct envelopes with wrong envelopes. Further sabotage was that he searched for the sand vials for the timer and dig holes in the ground to hide them from the group, meaning less time for Nathan to search for the correct envelopes he had already sabotaged.\n\n'''Mol Laser:''' Rob managed to hide throughout the laser tag field against most of the candidates, however, when it came down to Nathan's battle against him, Nathan's antics scared Rob until he chose to be taken out instead of being caught and unmasked. In the end of the assignment, Rob managed to take out \u20ac300.- from the group's pot.\n\n'''Scherp Stellen:''' Having memorized the 15 photographs required for the assignment beforehand, Rob made sure that the others didn't remember the correct instructions; causing only 4 out of the 15 photographs to be correct at the end of the assignment.\n\n'''Cijferkunst:''' Knowing that Nathan as the treasurer would have an influential role at the end of the assignment, Rob avoided pairing up with him. Paired up with Buddy, who wanted to bait Rob into sabotaging, he let Buddy bait him into giving Rik the wrong answer and causing the assignment to fail. It was the moment that Buddy finally locked onto Rob as the Mole, as the group's main suspect Leonie had just been executed from the game.\n\n'''Richtingsgevoel:''' Using a voice muffler over a phone, Rob tried to use reverse psychology against Nathan, to no avail. Leading to Nathan reclaiming the money he risked. With Miljuschka, he chose to build trust to bluff her later, however she too didn't fall for his tricks. Eventually, when he got to Buddy he managed to fool him out of \u20ac500.-, the eventual total in the assignment led up to \u20ac2,500.-, out of a potential \u20ac4,500.-.\n\n==Hidden Clues==\n'''Episode 1 - Afgeschermd:''' In ''Beltegoed'', Rob made sure to point out the \u20ac20.- to indicate that he was the 20th Mole.\n\n'''Episode 5 - Aangeraakt:''' The Candidates and audience could have spotted the Mole in ''Lezen en Schrijven''. One of the fans in the park said \"The Mole is here\" when Rob was on the screen searching.\n\n'''Episode Titles:''' The titles throughout the season pointed out to Rob's sabotages, Episode 2 ''Tegendraads'', which translates to contrary, is shown when the wires in ''Kleur Werk'' near Rob and Claes were in the contrary direction than where they should have been. ''Misleid'' (Mislead) pointed to Rob's role as the Traffic Guide misleading the drivers. ''Aangeraakt'' (Touched) had Rob literally touch the letters M, O, L, in that order during the ''Lettergreep'' assignment.\n\n'''Verkeer(d):''' During the beginning of the assignment, taking the first, second, third, and fourth letters of the first four road signs shown on screen, the letters M, O, L, R would spell out Mol R. A subtle suggestion that Rob was the Mole.\n\n'''Mol Laser:''' Rob's confessionals during this assignment were presented as the Mol talking to his opponents. And during his turn in the assignment he called out each of his opponents during the battle.\n\n'''Episode 6 - Voor Geen Meter:''' Rik's introduction monologue in this episode made a direct reference to one of Rob's tattoos. \"De Mol is tevreden.\" (The Mole is satisfied.) The words \"Tevreden\" is tattooed on Rob's shoulder, which is shown throughout the season.\n==Viewing Figures==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"| Viewing Figures\n|-\n! #\n!
