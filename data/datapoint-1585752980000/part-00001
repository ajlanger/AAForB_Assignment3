The food is commonly eaten and known under different names in countries across the region. It is usually dry salt or [[brine]] [[curing (food preservation)|cured]]. The East Slavic variety is sometimes treated with [[paprika]] or other seasonings, while the South Slavic version is often [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]].\n\nThe Slavic word \"salo\" or \"slanina\" as applied to this type of food (it has other meanings as well) is often translated to English as \"[[bacon]]\" or \"[[lard]]\". Unlike lard, salo is not [[Rendering (food processing)|rendered]]. Unlike bacon, salo has little or no lean meat. It is similar to Italian ''[[lardo]]'', the main differences being the thickness of the cut (''lardo'' is often sliced very thinly) and seasoning. [[East Slav]]ic salo uses salt, garlic, black pepper and sometimes [[coriander]] in the curing process, while ''lardo'' is generally seasoned with [[rosemary]] and other herbs.\n\n==Preservation==\nFor preservation, salo is salted and sometimes also smoked and aged in a dark and cold place, where it will last for a year or more. The slabs of fat are first cut into manageable pieces, typically 15\u00d720&nbsp;cm. Then layers of fat slabs (skin side down) topped with one-centimetre layers of salt go into a wooden box or barrel for curing.  For added flavouring and better preservation, the salo may be covered with a thick layer of [[paprika]] (usually in the more Western lands; in Russian salo with paprika is called \"Hungarian\"), minced [[garlic]], or sometimes [[black pepper]].\n\nWhen salo has been aged too long or exposed to light, the fat may oxidize on the surface and become yellow and bitter-tasting. Though no longer fit for culinary use, the spoiled fat can be used as a water-repellent treatment for leather boots or bait for [[mouse trap]]s, or it can simply be turned into homemade [[soap]].\n\n==Culinary==\n[[File:Salo.JPG|200px|thumb|''La\u0161iniai'', a Lithuanian type of salo]]\n\nSalo is consumed both raw and cooked. It is often fried or finely chopped with garlic as a condiment for [[borscht]] (beet soup). Small pieces of salo are added to some types of [[sausage]]. Thinly sliced salo on [[rye bread]] rubbed with [[garlic]] is a traditional snack to accompany [[vodka]] in Russia and [[horilka]] in Ukraine, where it is a particular favorite.\n\nSalo is often chopped into small pieces and fried to render fat for [[cooking]], while the remaining [[Pork rind|cracklings]] ({{lang|uk-Latn|[[\u010cvarci|shkvarky]]}} in Ukrainian, {{lang|ru|shkvarki}} in Russian, {{lang|lt|spirgai}} in Lithuanian, {{lang|pl|skwarki}} in Polish, {{lang|ro|jum\u0103ri}} in Romanian, {{lang|et|k\u00f5rned}} in [[Estonian language|Estonian]], t\u00f6p\u00f6rty\u0171 in Hungarian), \u043f\u0440\u044a\u0436\u043a\u0438 or \u0434\u0436\u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0438 in Bulgarian are used as condiments for fried [[potatoes]] or [[varenyky]] or spread on bread as a snack.\n\nThe thick pork skin that remains after the fat has been consumed is often used to make stock for soup or borscht. After boiling, the rind is often discarded. If soft enough, however, it is sometimes chopped or ground with salo, herbs, and spices and then spread on bread.\n\n==Salo in chocolate==\nThe expression \"chocolate-coated salo\" ({{lang|uk|\u0421\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0432 \u0448\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0456}}, ''salo v shokoladi''), originating in an [[ethnic joke]] about [[Ukrainians]], has become [[clich\u00e9]] among Eastern Slavs, referring to an eclectic mix of tastes or desires, such as  [[bacon ice cream]].\n\nIn the 2000s, [[Odessa]] Confectionery Factory started production of candies {{lang|uk-Latn|Salo v Shokoladi}}.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3825221.stm BBC News - ''Pork choc on the menu in Ukraine'' - 21 June 2004]</ref><ref>[http://www.itar-tass.com/level2.html?NewsID=2867823&PageNum=0 \u0418\u0442\u0430\u0440-\u0422\u0430\u0441\u0441<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218160647/http://www.itar-tass.com/level2.html?NewsID=2867823&PageNum=0 |date=18 February 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sostav.ru/news/2004/04/01/22/ \u041a 1 \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0446\u044b \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432 \"\u0441\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0432 \u0448\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\" <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The chocolate candies were invented as an [[April Fool's Day]] joke.
