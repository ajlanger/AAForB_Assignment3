It is closely related to and derived from, the [[Sharada script]] formerly employed for [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]]. It is also related to the [[Gurmukh\u012b script]] used to write [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. Until the late 1940s, an adapted version of the script (called '''[[Dogri script|Dogri]]''', '''Dogra''' or '''Dogra Akkhar''') was the official script for writing [[Dogri language|Dogri]] in the princely state of [[Kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir|Jammu and Kashmir]] and for [[Kangri language|Kangri]], Chambyali and [[Mandeali language|Mandyali]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]]. There is also some record of the script's use in the history of [[Nepali language|Nepali]] (Khas-kura). \n\nTakri itself has historically been used to write a number of [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] and [[Western Pahari languages|Western]] and [[Central Pahari languages]] in the [[Western Himalaya]], such as Gaddi or Gaddki (the language of the [[Gaddi (ethnic group)|Gaddi]] ethnic group), Kashtwari (the dialect centered on the Kashtwar or [[Kishtwar]] region of Jammu and Kashmir) and Chambyali (the language of the [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh|Chamba]] region of [[Himachal Pradesh]]).
