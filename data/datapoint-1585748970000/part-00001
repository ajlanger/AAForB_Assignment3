However, after the massacre, the Crown Prince survived for a short while in a coma.\n\nAlthough the prince never regained consciousness before dying, Crown Prince Dipendra was the monarch under the law of Nepali royal succession. Two days later after his death, the late King's surviving brother [[Gyanendra]] was proclaimed as a king.\n\n===2002\u20132007: Suspension of parliament and Loktantra Andolan===\n{{Main|2006 democracy movement in Nepal}}\nOn 1 February 2002 [[Gyanendra of Nepal|King Gyanendra]] suspended the Parliament, appointed a government led by himself, and enforced [[martial law]]. The King argued that civil politicians were unfit to handle the Maoist insurgency. Telephone lines were cut and several high-profile political leaders were detained. Other opposition leaders fled to India and regrouped there. A broad coalition called the Seven Party Alliance (SPA) was formed in opposition to the royal takeover, encompassing the seven parliamentary parties who held about 90% of the seats in the old, dissolved parliament.\n\nThe UN-[[OHCHR]], in response to events in Nepal, set up a monitoring program in 2005 to assess and observe the human rights situation there<ref>[http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/np/summary.htm Nepal Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717103319/http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/np/summary.htm |date=17 July 2007 }}, OHCHR.</ref>\n\nOn 22 November 2005, the [[Seven Party Alliance]] (SPA) of parliamentary parties and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) agreed on a historic and unprecedented 12-point memorandum of understanding (MOU) for peace and democracy. Nepali people from various walks of life and the international community regarded the MOU as an appropriate political response to the crisis that was developing in Nepal. Against the backdrop of the historical sufferings of the Nepali people and the enormous human cost of the last ten years of violent conflict, the MOU, which proposes a peaceful transition through an elected constituent assembly, created an acceptable formula for a united movement for democracy. As per the 12-point MOU, the SPA called for a protest movement, and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) supported it. This led to a countrywide uprising called the [[Loktantra Andolan]] that started in April 2006. All political forces including civil society and professional organisations actively galvanised the people. This resulted in massive and spontaneous demonstrations and rallies held across Nepal against King Gyanendra's autocratic rule.\n\nOn 21 April 2006, King Gyanendra declared that \"power would be returned to the people\". This had little effect on the people, who continued to occupy the streets of Kathmandu and other towns, openly defying the daytime curfew. Finally, King Gyanendra announced the reinstatement of the House of Representatives, thereby conceding one of the major demands of the SPA, at midnight on 24 April 2006. Following this action, the coalition of political forces decided to call off the protests.\n\nAt least 14 died during the 19 days of protests.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/04/23/nepal.protests/]</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 2006, the parliament assumed total legislative power and gave executive power to the Government of Nepal (previously known as His Majesty's Government). Names of many institutions (including the army) were stripped of the \"royal\" adjective and the Raj Parishad (a council of the King's advisers) was abolished, with his duties assigned to the Parliament itself. The activities of the King became subject to parliamentary scrutiny and the King's properties were subjected to taxation. Moreover, Nepal was declared a secular state abrogating the previous status of a Hindu Kingdom. However, most of the changes have, as yet, not been implemented.  On 19 July 2006, the prime minister, [[Girija Prasad Koirala|G. P.

CPN UML also joined this government, but the Nepali Congress took the part of the main opposition party.

Following a four-year autocratic rule by [[King Gyanendra]] that failed to defeat the Maoists, a mass civil protest was launched by a coalition of the maoists and the political parties in 2006, which forced the king to stepped down, brought the maoists to the peace process, and established a democratic republic by 2008.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\">{{Citation |last=Bell |first=Thomas |title=Nepal abolishes monarchy as King Gyanendra given fortnight to vacate palace |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/2044579/Nepal-abolishes-monarchy-as-King-Gyanendra-given-fortnight-to-vacate-palace.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=28 May 2008 |access-date=5 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416134742/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/2044579/Nepal-abolishes-monarchy-as-King-Gyanendra-given-fortnight-to-vacate-palace.html |archive-date=16 April 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/asia/2017/10/nepal-headed-communist-state-171014095129113.html|title=Is Nepal headed towards a communist state?|newspaper=[[Al Jazeera]]|access-date=26 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726113406/https://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/asia/2017/10/nepal-headed-communist-state-171014095129113.html|archive-date=26 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Prachanda.jpg|thumb|Prachanda speaking at a rally in Pokhara.]]\nFollowing the political consensus to draft the new constitution of the Republic via a constituent assembly, Nepali politics saw a rise of nationalist groups and ideologies.

However, after the massacre, the Crown Prince survived for a short while in a coma.\n\nAlthough the prince never regained consciousness before dying, Crown Prince Dipendra was the monarch under the law of Nepali royal succession. Two days later after his death, the late King's surviving brother [[Gyanendra]] was proclaimed as a king.\n\n===2002\u20132007: Suspension of parliament and Loktantra Andolan===\n{{Main|2006 democracy movement in Nepal}}\nOn 1 February 2002 [[Gyanendra of Nepal|King Gyanendra]] suspended the Parliament, appointed a government led by himself, and enforced [[martial law]]. The King argued that civil politicians were unfit to handle the Maoist insurgency. Telephone lines were cut and several high-profile political leaders were detained. Other opposition leaders fled to India and regrouped there. A broad coalition called the Seven Party Alliance (SPA) was formed in opposition to the royal takeover, encompassing the seven parliamentary parties who held about 90% of the seats in the old, dissolved parliament.\n\nThe UN-[[OHCHR]], in response to events in Nepal, set up a monitoring program in 2005 to assess and observe the human rights situation there<ref>[http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/np/summary.htm Nepal Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717103319/http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/np/summary.htm |date=17 July 2007 }}, OHCHR.</ref>\n\nOn 22 November 2005, the [[Seven Party Alliance]] (SPA) of parliamentary parties and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) agreed on a historic and unprecedented 12-point memorandum of understanding (MOU) for peace and democracy. Nepali people from various walks of life and the international community regarded the MOU as an appropriate political response to the crisis that was developing in Nepal. Against the backdrop of the historical sufferings of the Nepali people and the enormous human cost of the last ten years of violent conflict, the MOU, which proposes a peaceful transition through an elected constituent assembly, created an acceptable formula for a united movement for democracy. As per the 12-point MOU, the SPA called for a protest movement, and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) supported it. This led to a countrywide uprising called the [[Loktantra Andolan]] that started in April 2006. All political forces including civil society and professional organisations actively galvanised the people. This resulted in massive and spontaneous demonstrations and rallies held across Nepal against King Gyanendra's autocratic rule.\n\nOn 21 April 2006, King Gyanendra declared that \"power would be returned to the people\". This had little effect on the people, who continued to occupy the streets of Kathmandu and other towns, openly defying the daytime curfew. Finally, King Gyanendra announced the reinstatement of the House of Representatives, thereby conceding one of the major demands of the SPA, at midnight on 24 April 2006. Following this action, the coalition of political forces decided to call off the protests.\n\nAt least 14 died during the 19 days of protests.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/04/23/nepal.protests/]</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 2006, the parliament assumed total legislative power and gave executive power to the Government of Nepal (previously known as His Majesty's Government). Names of many institutions (including the army) were stripped of the \"royal\" adjective and the Raj Parishad (a council of the King's advisers) was abolished, with his duties assigned to the Parliament itself. The activities of the King became subject to parliamentary scrutiny and the King's properties were subjected to taxation. Moreover, Nepal was declared a secular state abrogating the previous status of a Hindu Kingdom. However, most of the changes have, as yet, not been implemented.  On 19 July 2006, the prime minister, [[Girija Prasad Koirala|G. P. Koirala]], sent a letter to the United Nations announcing the intention of the Nepali government to hold elections to a constituent assembly by April 2007.\n\n===December 2007 to May 2008: Abolition of the monarchy===\nOn 23 December 2007, an agreement was made for the monarchy to be abolished and the country to become a federal [[republic]] with the Prime Minister becoming [[head of state]].<ref name=\"Time 20071224\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1698161,00.html |title=Nepal to Abolish Monarchy |first=Binaj |last=Gurubacharya |magazine=Time |date=24 December 2007 |accessdate=26 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225150425/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1698161%2C00.html |archivedate=25 December 2007  }}</ref> The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) became the largest party amidst a general atmosphere of fear and intimidation from all sides.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11057207&amp;fsrc=nwl|newspaper=The Economist|title=The Maoists triumph | date=17 April 2008}}</ref> A federal republic was established in May 2008, with only four members of the 601-seat Constituent Assembly voting against the change,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7424302.stm Nepal votes to abolish monarchy] BBC News, 28 May 2008</ref> which ended 240 years of royal rule in Nepal.

CPN UML also joined this government, but the Nepali Congress took the part of the main opposition party.

But the [[President (government title)|President]] [[Ram Baran Yadav]], as the supreme head of\nmilitary power in the country, revoked this decision and gave the army chief additional time in office. An angry Prachanda and his party quit the government, majorly citing this reason and decided to operate as the main opposition to the government headed by CPN UML and its co-partner Nepali Congress afterward. [[Madhav Kumar Nepal]] was named the Prime Minister.\n\nThe Maoists demanded [[Civilian control of the military|civilian supremacy over the army]].\n\nThe Maoists forced closures \u2013 commonly known as ''bandhs'' \u2013 in the country, and also declared autonomous states for almost all the ethnic groups in Nepal.\n\nOn May 2012 the constitutional assembly was dissolved and another election to select the new constitutional assembly members were declared by Dr. Baburam Bhattarai.\n\n=== Madhes Movement (2007 - 2015/16) ===\n[[Madhes Movement]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/tag/madhes-movement/|title=Madhes movement - The Himalayan Times|website=The Himalayan Times|language=en-US|access-date=21 October 2017}}</ref> ([[Nepali language|Nepali]]: \u092e\u0927\u0947\u0938 \u0905\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094b\u0932\u0928) is a [[political movement]] launched by various political parties, especially those based in [[Madhesh|Madhes]], for equal rights, dignity and identity of [[Madhesi people|Madhesis]] and [[Tharu people|Tharus,]] [[Muslim]]s and Janjati groups in [[Nepal]].
