In most jurisdictions the ballots are preprinted with names of candidates and the text of the referendums. [[The Philippines]] (until 2007) and [[Japan]] are an exception. There, voters must write the names of their candidates on the ballot.<ref>https://www.ny.us.emb-japan.go.jp/en/c/2015/04-Apr/japaninfo-2015-04/06.html</ref>Election officials [[Vote counting system#Manual counting|manually count]] the ballots after the polls close and may be recounted in the event of a dispute.\n* In a jurisdiction using an [[optical scan voting system]], voters choose by filling an oval or by completing an arrow on the printed ballot next to their chosen candidate or referendum position. Voters with disabilities may be provided with electronic [[ballot marking device]]s. Optical scan technology has also been used by many standardized tests. Tabulating machines count the ballots either after the polls close or as the voters feed the ballots into the machine, in which case the results are not known until after the polls close. Officials often will manually count any ballots that cannot be read or with a [[write-in]] candidate and may recount the ballots in the event of a dispute.\n* In a jurisdiction using a [[Voting machine#Punched card|punched card system]], voters choose by removing or \"punching out\" a perforated [[Chad (paper)|chad]] from the ballot next each choice, sometimes with tools as simple as a pin, but usually with a [[ballot marking device]] such as the Votomatic. The ballot may be preprinted with candidates and referendums, or may be a generic ballot placed under a printed list of candidates and referendums. Tabulating machines count ballots after the polls close. Officials may manually count the ballots in the event of a dispute. Punched card voting systems are being replaced by other voting systems because of a high rate of inaccuracy related to the incomplete removal of the perforated chad and the inaccessibility to voters with disabilities.\n* In a jurisdiction using a mechanical voting system, often called a \"voting machine\", voters choose by pulling a lever next to their choice. There is a printed list of candidates, parties and referendums next to the levers indicating which lever is assigned to which choice. When the voter pulls a lever, it turns a connected gear in the machine, which turns a counter wheel. Each counter wheel shows a number, which is the number of votes cast using that lever. After the polls close, election officials check the wheels' positions and record the totals. No physical ballot is used in this system, except when the voter chooses to write-in a candidate. Other systems are replacing mechanical voting systems because they are inaccessible to disabled voters, do not have a physical ballot and are getting old.\n* In a jurisdiction using an electronic [[DRE voting machine|direct record voting system]] (DRE), voters choose by pushing a button next to a printed list of candidates and referendums, or by touching the candidate or referendums box on a [[touchscreen]] interface. As the voter makes a selection, the DRE creates an electronic ballot stored by in the memory components of the system. After the polls close, the system counts the votes and reports the totals to the election officials. Many DREs include a communication device to transmit vote totals to a central tabulator. The touchscreen systems remind people of an [[automated teller machine|automated teller machine (ATM)]] and often are described as such.\n* The bonser method is a method used in different parties such as the [[green party of Canada]]. This method requires the voter to select a color related to a proposition. Choices made can be red, yellow or green. They respectively indicate disapproval, the requirement for more clarity and approval.<ref name=\"Bonser\">[https://www.greenparty.ca/en/party/documents/rules-procedure/bonser-method Bonser Method.]  Retrieved 2016-10-06.</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=Smith|first=Sydney |authorlink=Sydney Smith|title=[[s:Ballot (Smith)|Ballot]]|year=1839|publisher=Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and Longmans|location=London}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ballot box]]\n*[[Ostracism]]\n*[[Sample ballot]]\n*[[Secret ballot]]\n*[[Vote counting systems]]\n*[[Chad (paper)]]\n*[[Direct democracy]]\n*[[Electoral fraud]]\n*[[List of democracy and elections-related topics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|ballot}}\n{{commons category|Ballot papers}}\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Ballot |short=x}}\n\n{{voting systems}}\n\n[[Category:Elections terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{short description|Document used to cast votes in an election}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2008}}\n{{Voting}}\n\nA '''ballot''' is a device used to cast votes in an election and may be found as a piece of paper or a small ball used in secret [[voting]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ballot|title=Ballot|publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> It was originally a small ball (see [[blackballing]]) used to record decisions made by voters in Italy around the 16th century.<ref>https://www.etymonline.com/word/ballot</ref>\n\nEach voter uses one ballot, and ballots are not shared.
