Born into a family of artists, Calder's work first gained attention in Paris in the 1920s and was soon championed by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, resulting in a retrospective exhibition in 1943. Major retrospectives were also held at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] (1964) and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]] (1974).\n\nCalder's work is in many permanent collections, most notably in the Whitney Museum of American Art, but also the Guggenheim Museum; the Museum of Modern Art; the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.; and the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]]. He produced many large public works, including ''.125'' (at JFK Airport, 1957), ''Pittsburgh'' ([[Carnegie International]] prize winner 1958, [[Pittsburgh International Airport]]) ''Spirale'' (UNESCO in Paris, 1958), [[Flamingo (sculpture)|''Flamingo'']] and ''Universe'' (both in Chicago, 1974), and ''[[Mountains and Clouds]]'' ([[Hart Senate Office Building]], Washington, D.C., 1996).\n\nAlthough primarily known for his sculpture, Calder also created paintings and prints, miniatures (such as his famous ''[[Cirque Calder]]''), theater set design, jewelry design, tapestries and rugs, and political posters.<ref name=\"Postiglione\">[[Corey Postiglione|Postiglione, Corey]]. \"Alexander Calder\", ''Dictionary of American Biography'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, Supplement 10 (1976-1980), 1994, p. 89-92.</ref> Calder was honored by the US Postal Service with a set of five 32-cent stamps in 1998, and received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], posthumously in 1977, after refusing to receive it from Gerald Ford one year earlier in protest of the Vietnam War.\n\nAn important work of Calder's is the monumental \"[[Floating Clouds (artwork)|Floating Clouds]]\" (1952-1953) of the [[Aula Magna (Central University of Venezuela)]] of the [[University City of Caracas]] in [[Venezuela]]. This work is a Unesco [[World Heritage Site]]. Calder's clouds were specially designed to combine art and technology, making the auditorium one of the top 5 university auditoriums in the world by sound quality.\n\n==Early life==\nAlexander \"Sandy\" Calder was born in 1898 in [[Lawnton, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexander Calder Chronology|url=http://www.calder.org/life/chronology|website=Calder Foundation|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}</ref> His actual birthday, however, remains a source of confusion. According to Calder's mother, Nanette (n\u00e9e Lederer), Calder was born on August 22, yet his birth certificate at Philadelphia City Hall, based on a hand-written ledger, stated July 22. When Calder's family learned about the birth certificate, they reasserted with certainty that city officials had made a mistake.\n\nCalder's grandfather, sculptor [[Alexander Milne Calder]], was born in Scotland, had immigrated to Philadelphia in 1868, and is best known for the colossal statue of [[William Penn]] on top of [[Philadelphia City Hall]]'s tower. His father, [[Alexander Stirling Calder]], was a well-known sculptor who created many public installations, a majority of them in nearby [[Philadelphia]]. Calder's mother was a professional portrait [[Painting|artist]], who had studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] and the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris from around 1888 until 1893. She moved to Philadelphia, where she met Stirling Calder while studying at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. Calder's parents married on February 22, 1895. Alexander Calder's sister, Mrs. Margaret Calder Hayes, was instrumental in the development of the [[UC Berkeley Art Museum]].<ref>Hayes, Margaret Calder. ''Three Alexander Calders: A Family Memoir''.

That same year he also completed his earliest sculpture, a clay elephant.<ref>Calder 1966, p. 13.</ref> Three years later, Alexander's father contracted [[tuberculosis]], and Calder's parents moved to a ranch in [[Oracle, Arizona]], leaving the children in the care of family friends for a year.<ref>Calder 1966, p. 15.</ref> The children were reunited with their parents in late March 1906 and stayed at the ranch in Arizona until autumn of the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calder.org |title=Calder Foundation |publisher=Calder.org |accessdate=July 21, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724024450/http://www.calder.org/ |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAfter Arizona, the Calder family moved to [[Pasadena, California]]. The windowed cellar of the family home became Calder's first studio and he received his first set of tools. He used scraps of copper wire that he found in the street to make jewelry for his sister's dolls. On January 1, 1907, Nanette Calder took her son to the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] in Pasadena, where he observed a four-horse-chariot race. This style of event later became the finale of Calder's miniature circus performances.<ref>Calder 1966, pp. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1909, the Calder family moved back to Philadelphia, where Calder briefly attended [[Germantown Academy]], then moved to [[Croton-on-Hudson]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>Calder 1966, pp. 28\u201329.</ref> That Christmas, he sculpted a dog and a duck out of sheet brass as gifts for his parents. The sculptures are three-dimensional and the duck is kinetic because it rocks when gently tapped.<ref>Hayes, Margaret Calder, ''Three Alexander Calders: A Family Memoir''. Middlebury, VT: Paul S. Eriksson, 1977, p. 41.</ref> In Croton, during his early high school years, Calder was befriended by his father's painter friend [[Everett Shinn]] with whom he built a gravity powered system of mechanical trains. Calder described it, \"We ran the train on wooden rails held by spikes; a chunk of iron racing down the incline speeded {{sic}} the cars. We even lit up some cars with candle lights\".<ref>Calder 1966, p. 31</ref> After Croton, the Calders moved to [[Spuyten Duyvil, Bronx|Spuyten Duyvil]] to be closer to New York City, where Stirling Calder rented a studio. While living in Spuyten Duyvil, Calder attended high school in nearby [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]]. In 1912, Stirling Calder was appointed acting chief of the Department of Sculpture of the [[Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition]] in [[San Francisco, California]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calder.org/chronology/period/1898-1930/10 |title=Panama Pacific International Exposition |publisher=calder.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526205504/http://calder.org/chronology/period/1898-1930/10 |archivedate=2008-05-26 }}</ref> and began work on sculptures for the exposition that was held in 1915.\n\nDuring Calder's high school years (1912\u20131915), the family moved back and forth between New York and California. In each new location, Calder's parents reserved cellar space as a studio for their son. Toward the end of this period, Calder stayed with friends in California while his parents moved back to New York, so that he could graduate from [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School in San Francisco]]. Calder graduated with the class of 1915. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n==Life and career==\nAlexander Calder's parents did not want him to be an artist, so he decided to study [[mechanical engineering]]. An intuitive engineer since childhood, Calder did not even know what mechanical engineering was. \"I was not very sure what this term meant, but I thought I'd better adopt it\", he later wrote in his autobiography. He enrolled at the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], New Jersey, in 1915.<ref name=\"Petroski\">{{cite journal |last=Petroski |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Petroski |date=September\u2013October 2012 |title=Portrait of the Artist as a Young Engineer |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=368\u2013373 |location=[[New Haven, Connecticut]] |publisher=[[Sigma XI Scientific Research Society|Sigma Xi]] |editor-first=David |editor-last=Schoonmaker |issn=0003-0996 |oclc=645082957|doi=10.1511/2012.98.368 }}</ref> When asked why he decided to study mechanical engineering instead of art Calder said, \"I wanted to be an engineer because some guy I rather liked was a mechanical engineer, that's all\".<ref name=\"My Way, Calder in Paris\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pval.org/cms/lib/NY19000481/Centricity/Domain/105/Calder%20Info.pdf|title=My Way, Calder in Paris|publisher=Seymour I Toll}}</ref> At Stevens, Calder was a member of the [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity and excelled in mathematics.<ref>Calder 1966, p. 47.</ref> He was well-liked and the class yearbook contained the following description, \"Sandy is evidently always happy, or perhaps up to some joke, for his face is always wrapped up in that same mischievous, juvenile grin. This is certainly the index to the man's character in this case, for he is one of the best natured fellows there is.\" <ref name=\"My Way, Calder in Paris\"/>\n\nIn the summer of 1916, Calder spent five weeks training at the Plattsburg Civilian Military Training Camp. In 1918, he joined the Student's Army Training Corps, Naval Section, at Stevens and was made guide of the battalion.<ref name = \"Biography\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calder.org/life/page/biography.html|title=Calder Biography|publisher=Calder Foundation|accessdate=July 31, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725130514/http://calder.org/life/page/biography.html| archivedate= 25 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nCalder received a degree from Stevens in 1919.<ref name=\"Petroski\" /> For the next several years, he held a variety of jobs, including working as a [[hydraulic engineer]] and a [[Drafter|draughtsman]] for the New York Edison Company. In June 1922, Calder found work as a mechanic on the passenger ship ''H. F. Alexander''. While the ship sailed from San Francisco to New York City, Calder slept on deck and awoke one early morning off the [[Guatemala|Guatemalan Coast]] and witnessed both the sun rising and the full moon setting on opposite horizons. He described in his autobiography, \"It was early one morning on a calm sea, off Guatemala, when over my couch\u2014a coil of rope\u2014I saw the beginning of a fiery red sunrise on one side and the moon looking like a silver coin on the other.\"<ref>Calder 1966, pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\nThe ''H.F. Alexander'' docked in San Francisco and Calder traveled up to [[Aberdeen, Washington]], where his sister lived with her husband, Kenneth Hayes. Calder took a job as a timekeeper at a logging camp. The mountain scenery inspired him to write home to request paints and brushes. Shortly after this, Calder decided to move back to New York to pursue a career as an artist.\n\n[[File:Calder-redmobile.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Red Mobile'', 1956, Painted sheet metal and metal rods, a signature work by Calder - [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]]]\nCalder moved to New York and enrolled at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]], studying briefly with [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[George Luks]], [[Kenneth Hayes Miller]], and [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]].<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Alexander%20Calder&page=1&f=Name&cr=1Alexander Calder] Guggenheim Collection.</ref> While a student, he worked for the ''[[National Police Gazette]]'' where, in 1925, one of his assignments was sketching the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]]. Calder became fascinated with the action of the [[circus]], a theme that would reappear in his later work.\n\nIn 1926, Calder moved to Paris, enrolled in the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]], and established a studio at 22 rue Daguerre in the [[Montparnasse|Montparnasse Quarter]]. In June 1929, while traveling by boat from Paris to New York, Calder met his future wife, Louisa James (1905-1996), grandniece of author [[Henry James]] and philosopher [[William James]]. They married in 1931. While in Paris, Calder met and became friends with a number of [[avant-garde]] artists, including [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Jean Arp]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. Leger wrote a preface for the catalogue of Calder's first exhibition of abstract constructions held at the Galerie Percier in 1931.<ref name=\"Postiglione\" /> Calder and Louisa returned to America in 1933 to settle in a farmhouse they purchased in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]], where they raised a family (first daughter, Sandra born 1935, second daughter, Mary, in 1939). During [[World War II]], Calder attempted to join the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] as a [[camouflage|camofleur]], but was rejected. In 1955 Alexander and Louisa Calder traveled around in India for three months, where Calder produced nine sculptures as well as some jewelry.<ref>[http://ordovasart.com/exhibitions/calder/ Calder in India, 31 May \u2013 3 August 2012] Ordovas, London.</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Calder settled into his new workshop, which overlooked the valley of the Lower Chevri\u00e8re to Sach\u00e9 in [[Indre-et-Loire]] (France). He donated to the town a sculpture, which since 1974 has been situated in the town square. Throughout his artistic career, Calder named many of his works in French, regardless of where they were destined for eventual display.\n\nIn 1966, Calder published his ''Autobiography with Pictures'' with the help of his son-in-law, Jean Davidson.\n\nCalder died unexpectedly on November 11, 1976, of a heart attack,<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/12/archives/alexander-calder-leading-us-artist-dies-alexander-calder-major.html?mcubz=1 |title = Alexander Calder, Leading U.S. Artist, Dies|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1976-11-12|last1 = Russell|first1 = John}}</ref> shortly after the opening of a major retrospective show at the Whitney Museum in New York.\n\n== Artistic work ==\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n[[File:'Hi!

At the urging of fellow sculptor [[Jose de Creeft]], he submitted them to the [[Salon des Humoristes]]. Calder began to create his ''[[Cirque Calder]]'', a miniature circus fashioned from wire, cloth, string, rubber, cork, and other found objects. Designed to be transportable (it eventually grew to fill five large suitcases), the circus was presented on both sides of the Atlantic. Soon, his ''Cirque Calder''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ubu.artmob.ca/video/Calder-Alexander_Le-cirque.avi |title=Archived item |accessdate=2007-07-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710114653/http://ubu.artmob.ca/video/Calder-Alexander_Le-cirque.avi |archivedate=2007-07-10 }}</ref> (on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art at present) became popular with the Parisian avant-garde. He also invented [[wire sculpture]], or \"drawing in space\", and in 1929 he had his first solo show of these sculptures in Paris at Galerie Billiet. ''Hi! (Two Acrobats)'' in the collection of the [[Honolulu Museum of Art]] is an early example of the artist's wire sculpture. The painter [[Jules Pascin]], a friend of Calder's from the cafes of [[Montparnasse]], wrote the preface to the catalog. A visit to [[Piet Mondrian]]'s studio in 1930, where he was impressed by the environment-as-installation, \"shocked\" him into fully embracing [[abstract art]], toward which he had already been tending.<ref name=Haag>{{cite web|title=Alexander Calder: The Great Discovery|url=http://www.gemeentemuseum.nl/index.php?id=037076|work=Gemeentemuseum Den Haag|publisher=Gemeentemuseum Den Haag|accessdate=2012-04-08}}</ref>\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1042 STABILE \u05de\u05d7\u05d5\u05d5\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd.JPG|thumb|right|''Homage to Jerusalem'' on [[Mount Herzl]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]]]\nIt was the mixture of his experiments to develop purely abstract sculpture following his visit with Mondrian that led to his first truly kinetic sculptures, manipulated by means of cranks and motors, that would become his signature artworks. Calder's kinetic sculptures are regarded as being amongst the earliest manifestations of an art that consciously departed from the traditional notion of the art work as a static object and integrated the ideas of gesture and immateriality as aesthetic factors.<ref>[http://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/en/collection/alexander-calder Alexander Calder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912021254/http://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/en/collection/alexander-calder |date=2011-09-12 }} [[Fondation Beyeler]], Riehen.</ref>\n\nDating from 1931, Calder's sculptures of discrete movable parts powered by motors were christened \"mobiles\" by [[Marcel Duchamp]], a French pun meaning both \"motion\" and \"motive\".<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/737 Alexander Calder, ''Romulus and Remus'' (1928)] Guggenheim Collection.</ref> However, Calder found that the motorized works sometimes became monotonous in their prescribed movements. His solution, arrived at by 1932, was hanging sculptures that derived their motion from touch or air currents. They were followed in 1934 by outdoor pieces which were set in motion by the open air.<ref name=\"Alexander Calder\">[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&artistid=848&page=1&sole=y&collab=y&attr=y&sort=default&tabview=bio Alexander Calder] Tate Collection.</ref> The wind mobiles featured abstract shapes delicately balanced on pivoting rods that moved with the slightest current of air, allowing for a freer, more natural, shifting play of forms and spatial relationships.<ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/60736.html Alexander Calder, ''Ghost'' (1964)] Philadelphia Museum of Art.</ref> At the same time, Calder was also experimenting with self-supporting, static, [[Abstract art|abstract]] sculptures, dubbed \"stabiles\" by [[Jean Arp]] in 1932 to differentiate them from mobiles. In 1935\u20131936, he produced a number of works made largely of carved wood. At [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] (1937), the Spanish pavilion included Calder's sculpture ''[[Calder's fountain|Mercury Fountain]]''.\n\nAlthough Calder's sculptures are not explicitly representational, many of his themes, symbols and shapes are related to the cosmos or suggestive of nature.<ref name=\"Postiglione\" /> During [[World War II]], Calder continued to sculpt, adapting to a scarcity of aluminium during the war by returning to [[wood carving|carved wood]] in a new open form of sculpture called \"constellations\".<ref name=rk /> Once the war was over, Calder began to cut shapes from sheet metal into evocative forms and would hand-paint them in his characteristically pure hues of black, red, blue, and white.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5371716 Alexander Calder, ''Untitled'' (1948)] [[Christie's]] Post-War and Contemporary Evening Sale, 10 November 2010, New York.</ref> Calder created a small group of works from around this period with a hanging base-plate, for example ''Lily of Force'' (1945), ''Baby Flat Top'' (1946), and ''Red is Dominant'' (1947).

Calder's largest sculpture at 25.7&nbsp;meters high was ''El Sol Rojo'', constructed outside the Aztec Stadium for the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] \"Cultural Olympiad\" events in [[Mexico City]]. Many of his public works were commissioned by renowned architects; [[I.M. Pei]] commissioned his ''[[La Grande Voile (The Big Sail)|La Grande Voile]]'' (1966), a 25-ton, 40-foot high stabile for the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].\n\nIn 1934, Calder made his first outdoor works in his [[Roxbury, Connecticut]], studio, using the same techniques and materials as his smaller works. Exhibited outside, Calder's initial standing mobiles moved elegantly in the breeze, bobbing and swirling in natural, spontaneous rhythms. In fact, the first few outdoor works were too delicate for strong winds, which forced Calder to rethink his fabrication process.\n\nIn 1936, he responded to the problem, changing his working methods. He began to create smaller scale [[maquette]]s that he then enlarged to monumental size. The small metal maquette, the first step in the production of a monumental sculpture, was already for Calder a sculpture in its own right. The larger works were made under his direction, using the classic enlargement techniques used in different ways by traditional sculptors, including his father and grandfather. Calder began to draw his designs on brown craft paper, which he enlarged using a grid. His large-scale works were created according to his exact specifications, while also allowing him the liberty to adjust or correct a shape or line if necessary.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5371732 Alexander Calder, ''Red Curlicue '' (1973)] [[Christie's]] Post-War and Contemporary Evening Sale, 10 November 2010, New York.</ref>\n\n[[File:LaGrandeVitesse1969.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Calders' La Grande Vitesse'' (1969), [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]]]\nHe made most of his monumental stabiles and mobiles after 1962 at Etablissements Bi\u00e9mont in [[Tours, France]]. Calder would create a model of his work, the engineering department would scale it up to final size under Calder's direction, and then technicians would complete the actual metalwork \u2014 all under Calder's watchful eye. Stabiles were made in steel plate, then painted in black or in colors. An exception was ''Trois disques'', in [[stainless steel]] at 24&nbsp;meters tall, which was commissioned by [[International Nickel Company of Canada]].\n\nIn 1958, Calder asked [[Jean Prouv\u00e9]] to construct the steel base of ''Spirale'' in France, a monumental mobile for the UNESCO site in Paris, while the top was fabricated in Connecticut.

As Calder's sculpture moved into the realm of pure abstraction in the early 1930s, so did his prints. The thin lines used to define figures in the earlier prints and drawings began delineating groups of geometric shapes, often in motion. Calder also used prints for advocacy, as in poster prints from 1967 and 1969 protesting the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Bejamin Genocchio (December 18, 2009) [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/nyregion/20artsct.html Beyond the Mobiles] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\nAs Calder's professional reputation expanded in the late 1940s and 1950s, so did his production of prints.

[[George Stanley Gordon]], founder of the New York City advertising agency Gordon and Shortt, first approached Calder with the idea of painting a jet in 1972, but Calder responded that he did not paint toys. When Gordon told him it was a real, full-sized airliner he was proposing that Calder paint, the artist immediately gave his approval. Gordon felt that Braniff, known for melding the worlds of fashion and design with the world of aviation, would be the perfect company to carry out the idea. Braniff Chairman [[Harding Lawrence]] was highly receptive and a contract was drawn up in 1973 calling for the painting of one Douglas DC-8-62 jet liner, dubbed ''Flying Colors'', and 50 gouaches for a total price of $100,000.<ref name=Gordon>{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=George Stanley|title=My Pal, Alexander Calder|url=http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/240/40/|website=www.brownalumnimagazine.com|accessdate=22 July 2014}}</ref> Two years later, Braniff asked Calder to design a flagship for their fleet celebrating the U.S. Bicentennial.

Major retrospectives of his work were held at the Solomon R.

In addition, both of Calder's dealers, Galerie Maeght in Paris and the Perls Galleries in New York, averaged about one Calder show each per year.\n\nAn exhibition was held at the [[Hauser & Wirth]] gallery in [[Bruton]] (a town in [[Somerset]]), called ''Alexander Calder: From the Stony River to the Sky''.

Calder created a {{convert|1|ft|m|adj=on}} high sheet metal [[maquette]] in 1973 for an unrealized stabile he called ''Two White Dots''. He gave this maquette to Carmen Segretario, founder and owner of the Segr\u00e9 Foundry of [[Waterbury, Connecticut]]. For decades, Calder had utilized the services of Segr\u00e9 Foundry in manufacturing his mobiles and stabiles. Each piece (no matter how many copies were made) would be initialled personally by Calder in white chalk, after which a welder would follow the chalk marks to burn the initials into the work. Calder died in 1976, without a full-size version of ''Two White Dots'' ever having been made. In 1982, Segretario constructed a full-size version of ''Two White Dots'', and sold it in 1983 to art dealer Shirley Teplitz for $70,000. Segetario's documentation claimed that the work had been fabricated around 1974 \"under the supervision and direction of Artist\".<ref name=somma>{{cite news|last=Somma|first=Ann Marie|title=The Calder Work That Wasn't|work=Hartford Courant|date=March 12, 2006|accessdate=April 15, 2016|url=http://articles.courant.com/2006-03-12/news/0603120044_1_alexander-calder-big-time-art-fakes-sculpture}}</ref> ''Two White Dots'' was then sold at auction in May 1984 for $187,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hogrefe|first=Jeffrey|title=Top Price For Calder|work=The Washington Post|date=May 10, 1984|accessdate=April 15, 2016|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1984/05/10/top-price-for-calder/bf264ef8-10a7-44ee-bf45-fd3656aef5e9/}}</ref> Over the next decade, the piece was sold repeatedly. In 1995, [[Jon Shirley]] (the former president of [[Microsoft]] and a Calder collector) purchased ''Two White Dots'' for $1 million. When Shirley submitted the work to the Calder Foundation for inclusion in their catalogue raisonn\u00e9, the Foundation contested the work's authenticity. The [[Andr\u00e9 Emmerich|Andr\u00e9 Emmerich Gallery]] refunded Shirley's money, and sued the Segr\u00e9 Foundry, which sought [[bankruptcy]] protection. The suit was settled out of court in the late 1990s.

Born into a family of artists, Calder's work first gained attention in Paris in the 1920s and was soon championed by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, resulting in a retrospective exhibition in 1943. Major retrospectives were also held at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] (1964) and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]] (1974).\n\nCalder's work is in many permanent collections, most notably in the Whitney Museum of American Art, but also the Guggenheim Museum; the Museum of Modern Art; the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.; and the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]]. He produced many large public works, including ''.125'' (at JFK Airport, 1957), ''Pittsburgh'' ([[Carnegie International]] prize winner 1958, [[Pittsburgh International Airport]]) ''Spirale'' (UNESCO in Paris, 1958), [[Flamingo (sculpture)|''Flamingo'']] and ''Universe'' (both in Chicago, 1974), and ''[[Mountains and Clouds]]'' ([[Hart Senate Office Building]], Washington, D.C., 1996).\n\nAlthough primarily known for his sculpture, Calder also created paintings and prints, miniatures (such as his famous ''[[Cirque Calder]]''), theater set design, jewelry design, tapestries and rugs, and political posters.<ref name=\"Postiglione\">[[Corey Postiglione|Postiglione, Corey]]. \"Alexander Calder\", ''Dictionary of American Biography'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, Supplement 10 (1976-1980), 1994, p. 89-92.</ref> Calder was honored by the US Postal Service with a set of five 32-cent stamps in 1998, and received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], posthumously in 1977, after refusing to receive it from Gerald Ford one year earlier in protest of the Vietnam War.\n\nAn important work of Calder's is the monumental \"[[Floating Clouds (artwork)|Floating Clouds]]\" (1952-1953) of the [[Aula Magna (Central University of Venezuela)]] of the [[University City of Caracas]] in [[Venezuela]]. This work is a Unesco [[World Heritage Site]]. Calder's clouds were specially designed to combine art and technology, making the auditorium one of the top 5 university auditoriums in the world by sound quality.\n\n==Early life==\nAlexander \"Sandy\" Calder was born in 1898 in [[Lawnton, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexander Calder Chronology|url=http://www.calder.org/life/chronology|website=Calder Foundation|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}</ref> His actual birthday, however, remains a source of confusion. According to Calder's mother, Nanette (n\u00e9e Lederer), Calder was born on August 22, yet his birth certificate at Philadelphia City Hall, based on a hand-written ledger, stated July 22. When Calder's family learned about the birth certificate, they reasserted with certainty that city officials had made a mistake.\n\nCalder's grandfather, sculptor [[Alexander Milne Calder]], was born in Scotland, had immigrated to Philadelphia in 1868, and is best known for the colossal statue of [[William Penn]] on top of [[Philadelphia City Hall]]'s tower. His father, [[Alexander Stirling Calder]], was a well-known sculptor who created many public installations, a majority of them in nearby [[Philadelphia]]. Calder's mother was a professional portrait [[Painting|artist]], who had studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] and the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris from around 1888 until 1893. She moved to Philadelphia, where she met Stirling Calder while studying at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. Calder's parents married on February 22, 1895. Alexander Calder's sister, Mrs. Margaret Calder Hayes, was instrumental in the development of the [[UC Berkeley Art Museum]].<ref>Hayes, Margaret Calder. ''Three Alexander Calders: A Family Memoir''. Middlebury, VT: Paul S. Eriksson, 1977. <!-- ISBN#?? --></ref>\n\nIn 1902, Calder posed nude for his father's sculpture ''The Man Cub'', a cast of which is now located in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City. That same year he also completed his earliest sculpture, a clay elephant.<ref>Calder 1966, p. 13.</ref> Three years later, Alexander's father contracted [[tuberculosis]], and Calder's parents moved to a ranch in [[Oracle, Arizona]], leaving the children in the care of family friends for a year.<ref>Calder 1966, p. 15.</ref> The children were reunited with their parents in late March 1906 and stayed at the ranch in Arizona until autumn of the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calder.org |title=Calder Foundation |publisher=Calder.org |accessdate=July 21, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724024450/http://www.calder.org/ |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAfter Arizona, the Calder family moved to [[Pasadena, California]]. The windowed cellar of the family home became Calder's first studio and he received his first set of tools. He used scraps of copper wire that he found in the street to make jewelry for his sister's dolls. On January 1, 1907, Nanette Calder took her son to the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] in Pasadena, where he observed a four-horse-chariot race. This style of event later became the finale of Calder's miniature circus performances.<ref>Calder 1966, pp. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1909, the Calder family moved back to Philadelphia, where Calder briefly attended [[Germantown Academy]], then moved to [[Croton-on-Hudson]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>Calder 1966, pp. 28\u201329.</ref> That Christmas, he sculpted a dog and a duck out of sheet brass as gifts for his parents. The sculptures are three-dimensional and the duck is kinetic because it rocks when gently tapped.<ref>Hayes, Margaret Calder, ''Three Alexander Calders: A Family Memoir''. Middlebury, VT: Paul S. Eriksson, 1977, p. 41.</ref> In Croton, during his early high school years, Calder was befriended by his father's painter friend [[Everett Shinn]] with whom he built a gravity powered system of mechanical trains. Calder described it, \"We ran the train on wooden rails held by spikes; a chunk of iron racing down the incline speeded {{sic}} the cars. We even lit up some cars with candle lights\".<ref>Calder 1966, p. 31</ref> After Croton, the Calders moved to [[Spuyten Duyvil, Bronx|Spuyten Duyvil]] to be closer to New York City, where Stirling Calder rented a studio. While living in Spuyten Duyvil, Calder attended high school in nearby [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]]. In 1912, Stirling Calder was appointed acting chief of the Department of Sculpture of the [[Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition]] in [[San Francisco, California]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calder.org/chronology/period/1898-1930/10 |title=Panama Pacific International Exposition |publisher=calder.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526205504/http://calder.org/chronology/period/1898-1930/10 |archivedate=2008-05-26 }}</ref> and began work on sculptures for the exposition that was held in 1915.\n\nDuring Calder's high school years (1912\u20131915), the family moved back and forth between New York and California. In each new location, Calder's parents reserved cellar space as a studio for their son. Toward the end of this period, Calder stayed with friends in California while his parents moved back to New York, so that he could graduate from [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School in San Francisco]]. Calder graduated with the class of 1915. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n==Life and career==\nAlexander Calder's parents did not want him to be an artist, so he decided to study [[mechanical engineering]]. An intuitive engineer since childhood, Calder did not even know what mechanical engineering was. \"I was not very sure what this term meant, but I thought I'd better adopt it\", he later wrote in his autobiography. He enrolled at the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], New Jersey, in 1915.<ref name=\"Petroski\">{{cite journal |last=Petroski |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Petroski |date=September\u2013October 2012 |title=Portrait of the Artist as a Young Engineer |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=368\u2013373 |location=[[New Haven, Connecticut]] |publisher=[[Sigma XI Scientific Research Society|Sigma Xi]] |editor-first=David |editor-last=Schoonmaker |issn=0003-0996 |oclc=645082957|doi=10.1511/2012.98.368 }}</ref> When asked why he decided to study mechanical engineering instead of art Calder said, \"I wanted to be an engineer because some guy I rather liked was a mechanical engineer, that's all\".<ref name=\"My Way, Calder in Paris\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pval.org/cms/lib/NY19000481/Centricity/Domain/105/Calder%20Info.pdf|title=My Way, Calder in Paris|publisher=Seymour I Toll}}</ref> At Stevens, Calder was a member of the [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity and excelled in mathematics.<ref>Calder 1966, p. 47.</ref> He was well-liked and the class yearbook contained the following description, \"Sandy is evidently always happy, or perhaps up to some joke, for his face is always wrapped up in that same mischievous, juvenile grin. This is certainly the index to the man's character in this case, for he is one of the best natured fellows there is.\" <ref name=\"My Way, Calder in Paris\"/>\n\nIn the summer of 1916, Calder spent five weeks training at the Plattsburg Civilian Military Training Camp. In 1918, he joined the Student's Army Training Corps, Naval Section, at Stevens and was made guide of the battalion.<ref name = \"Biography\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calder.org/life/page/biography.html|title=Calder Biography|publisher=Calder Foundation|accessdate=July 31, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725130514/http://calder.org/life/page/biography.html| archivedate= 25 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nCalder received a degree from Stevens in 1919.<ref name=\"Petroski\" /> For the next several years, he held a variety of jobs, including working as a [[hydraulic engineer]] and a [[draughtsman]] for the New York Edison Company. In June 1922, Calder found work as a mechanic on the passenger ship ''H. F. Alexander''. While the ship sailed from San Francisco to New York City, Calder slept on deck and awoke one early morning off the [[Guatemala|Guatemalan Coast]] and witnessed both the sun rising and the full moon setting on opposite horizons. He described in his autobiography, \"It was early one morning on a calm sea, off Guatemala, when over my couch\u2014a coil of rope\u2014I saw the beginning of a fiery red sunrise on one side and the moon looking like a silver coin on the other.\"<ref>Calder 1966, pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\nThe ''H.F. Alexander'' docked in San Francisco and Calder traveled up to [[Aberdeen, Washington]], where his sister lived with her husband, Kenneth Hayes. Calder took a job as a timekeeper at a logging camp. The mountain scenery inspired him to write home to request paints and brushes. Shortly after this, Calder decided to move back to New York to pursue a career as an artist.\n\n[[File:Calder-redmobile.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Red Mobile'', 1956, Painted sheet metal and metal rods, a signature work by Calder - [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]]]\nCalder moved to New York and enrolled at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]], studying briefly with [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[George Luks]], [[Kenneth Hayes Miller]], and [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]].<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Alexander%20Calder&page=1&f=Name&cr=1Alexander Calder] Guggenheim Collection.</ref> While a student, he worked for the ''[[National Police Gazette]]'' where, in 1925, one of his assignments was sketching the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]]. Calder became fascinated with the action of the [[circus]], a theme that would reappear in his later work.\n\nIn 1926, Calder moved to Paris, enrolled in the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]], and established a studio at 22 rue Daguerre in the [[Montparnasse|Montparnasse Quarter]]. In June 1929, while traveling by boat from Paris to New York, Calder met his future wife, Louisa James (1905-1996), grandniece of author [[Henry James]] and philosopher [[William James]]. They married in 1931. While in Paris, Calder met and became friends with a number of [[avant-garde]] artists, including [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Jean Arp]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. Leger wrote a preface for the catalogue of Calder's first exhibition of abstract constructions held at the Galerie Percier in 1931.<ref name=\"Postiglione\" /> Calder and Louisa returned to America in 1933 to settle in a farmhouse they purchased in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]], where they raised a family (first daughter, Sandra born 1935, second daughter, Mary, in 1939). During [[World War II]], Calder attempted to join the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] as a [[camouflage|camofleur]], but was rejected. In 1955 Alexander and Louisa Calder traveled around in India for three months, where Calder produced nine sculptures as well as some jewelry.<ref>[http://ordovasart.com/exhibitions/calder/ Calder in India, 31 May \u2013 3 August 2012] Ordovas, London.</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Calder settled into his new workshop, which overlooked the valley of the Lower Chevri\u00e8re to Sach\u00e9 in [[Indre-et-Loire]] (France). He donated to the town a sculpture, which since 1974 has been situated in the town square. Throughout his artistic career, Calder named many of his works in French, regardless of where they were destined for eventual display.\n\nIn 1966, Calder published his ''Autobiography with Pictures'' with the help of his son-in-law, Jean Davidson.\n\nCalder died unexpectedly on November 11, 1976, of a heart attack,<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/12/archives/alexander-calder-leading-us-artist-dies-alexander-calder-major.html?mcubz=1 |title = Alexander Calder, Leading U.S. Artist, Dies|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1976-11-12|last1 = Russell|first1 = John}}</ref> shortly after the opening of a major retrospective show at the Whitney Museum in New York.\n\n== Artistic work ==\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n[[File:'Hi!

At the urging of fellow sculptor [[Jose de Creeft]], he submitted them to the [[Salon des Humoristes]]. Calder began to create his ''[[Cirque Calder]]'', a miniature circus fashioned from wire, cloth, string, rubber, cork, and other found objects. Designed to be transportable (it eventually grew to fill five large suitcases), the circus was presented on both sides of the Atlantic.

He also invented [[wire sculpture]], or \"drawing in space\", and in 1929 he had his first solo show of these sculptures in Paris at Galerie Billiet. ''Hi! (Two Acrobats)'' in the collection of the [[Honolulu Museum of Art]] is an early example of the artist's wire sculpture. The painter [[Jules Pascin]], a friend of Calder's from the cafes of [[Montparnasse]], wrote the preface to the catalog.

Calder's kinetic sculptures are regarded as being amongst the earliest manifestations of an art that consciously departed from the traditional notion of the art work as a static object and integrated the ideas of gesture and immateriality as aesthetic factors.<ref>[http://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/en/collection/alexander-calder Alexander Calder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912021254/http://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/en/collection/alexander-calder |date=2011-09-12 }} [[Fondation Beyeler]], Riehen.</ref>\n\nDating from 1931, Calder's sculptures of discrete movable parts powered by motors were christened \"mobiles\" by [[Marcel Duchamp]], a French pun meaning both \"motion\" and \"motive\".<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/737 Alexander Calder, ''Romulus and Remus'' (1928)] Guggenheim Collection.</ref> However, Calder found that the motorized works sometimes became monotonous in their prescribed movements. His solution, arrived at by 1932, was hanging sculptures that derived their motion from touch or air currents.

In 1935\u20131936, he produced a number of works made largely of carved wood. At [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] (1937), the Spanish pavilion included Calder's sculpture ''[[Calder's fountain|Mercury Fountain]]''.\n\nAlthough Calder's sculptures are not explicitly representational, many of his themes, symbols and shapes are related to the cosmos or suggestive of nature.<ref name=\"Postiglione\" /> During [[World War II]], Calder continued to sculpt, adapting to a scarcity of aluminium during the war by returning to [[wood carving|carved wood]] in a new open form of sculpture called \"constellations\".<ref name=rk /> Once the war was over, Calder began to cut shapes from sheet metal into evocative forms and would hand-paint them in his characteristically pure hues of black, red, blue, and white.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5371716 Alexander Calder, ''Untitled'' (1948)] [[Christie's]] Post-War and Contemporary Evening Sale, 10 November 2010, New York.</ref> Calder created a small group of works from around this period with a hanging base-plate, for example ''Lily of Force'' (1945), ''Baby Flat Top'' (1946), and ''Red is Dominant'' (1947).

According to this viewpoint, the mobile marked an abandonment, as well, of Modernism's larger goal of a rapprochement with science and engineering, and with unfortunate long-term implications for contemporary art.\n\n=== Monumental works ===\n[[File:Oeuvre de Calder.jpg|upright|thumb|''Trois disques'', a sculpture by Alexander Calder for [[Expo 67]], on [[Saint Helen's Island]] [[Parc Jean-Drapeau]], [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada]]\n\nIn the 1950s, Calder increasingly concentrated his efforts on producing monumental sculptures (his self-described period of \"''agrandissements''\"), particularly as public commissions increasingly came his way in the 1960s.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/sculptures-statues-figures/alexander-calder-le-rouge-de-sache-5559218-details.aspx?pos=2&intObjectID=5559218&sid=&page=5 Alexander Calder, ''Le Rouge de Sach\u00e9'' (1954)] [[Christie's]] Post-War and Contemporary Evening Sale, 8 May 2012, New York.</ref> Notable examples are ''.125'' for [[JFK Airport]] in 1957, ''Spirale'' for [[UNESCO]] in Paris 1958 and ''Trois disques'', commissioned for [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada. Calder's largest sculpture at 25.7&nbsp;meters high was ''El Sol Rojo'', constructed outside the Aztec Stadium for the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] \"Cultural Olympiad\" events in [[Mexico City]]. Many of his public works were commissioned by renowned architects; [[I.M. Pei]] commissioned his ''[[La Grande Voile (The Big Sail)|La Grande Voile]]'' (1966), a 25-ton, 40-foot high stabile for the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].\n\nIn 1934, Calder made his first outdoor works in his [[Roxbury, Connecticut]], studio, using the same techniques and materials as his smaller works. Exhibited outside, Calder's initial standing mobiles moved elegantly in the breeze, bobbing and swirling in natural, spontaneous rhythms. In fact, the first few outdoor works were too delicate for strong winds, which forced Calder to rethink his fabrication process.\n\nIn 1936, he responded to the problem, changing his working methods. He began to create smaller scale [[maquette]]s that he then enlarged to monumental size. The small metal maquette, the first step in the production of a monumental sculpture, was already for Calder a sculpture in its own right. The larger works were made under his direction, using the classic enlargement techniques used in different ways by traditional sculptors, including his father and grandfather. Calder began to draw his designs on brown craft paper, which he enlarged using a grid. His large-scale works were created according to his exact specifications, while also allowing him the liberty to adjust or correct a shape or line if necessary.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5371732 Alexander Calder, ''Red Curlicue '' (1973)] [[Christie's]] Post-War and Contemporary Evening Sale, 10 November 2010, New York.</ref>\n\n[[File:LaGrandeVitesse1969.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Calders' La Grande Vitesse'' (1969), [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]]]\nHe made most of his monumental stabiles and mobiles after 1962 at Etablissements Bi\u00e9mont in [[Tours, France]]. Calder would create a model of his work, the engineering department would scale it up to final size under Calder's direction, and then technicians would complete the actual metalwork \u2014 all under Calder's watchful eye. Stabiles were made in steel plate, then painted in black or in colors. An exception was ''Trois disques'', in [[stainless steel]] at 24&nbsp;meters tall, which was commissioned by [[International Nickel Company of Canada]].\n\nIn 1958, Calder asked [[Jean Prouv\u00e9]] to construct the steel base of ''Spirale'' in France, a monumental mobile for the UNESCO site in Paris, while the top was fabricated in Connecticut. In June 1969, Calder attended the dedication of his monumental stabile ''[[La Grande Vitesse]]'' in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].

As Calder's sculpture moved into the realm of pure abstraction in the early 1930s, so did his prints. The thin lines used to define figures in the earlier prints and drawings began delineating groups of geometric shapes, often in motion. Calder also used prints for advocacy, as in poster prints from 1967 and 1969 protesting the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Bejamin Genocchio (December 18, 2009) [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/nyregion/20artsct.html Beyond the Mobiles] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\nAs Calder's professional reputation expanded in the late 1940s and 1950s, so did his production of prints.

When Gordon told him it was a real, full-sized airliner he was proposing that Calder paint, the artist immediately gave his approval. Gordon felt that Braniff, known for melding the worlds of fashion and design with the world of aviation, would be the perfect company to carry out the idea. Braniff Chairman [[Harding Lawrence]] was highly receptive and a contract was drawn up in 1973 calling for the painting of one Douglas DC-8-62 jet liner, dubbed ''Flying Colors'', and 50 gouaches for a total price of $100,000.<ref name=Gordon>{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=George Stanley|title=My Pal, Alexander Calder|url=http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/240/40/|website=www.brownalumnimagazine.com|accessdate=22 July 2014}}</ref> Two years later, Braniff asked Calder to design a flagship for their fleet celebrating the U.S. Bicentennial.

Calder created a {{convert|1|ft|m|adj=on}} high sheet metal [[maquette]] in 1973 for an unrealized stabile he called ''Two White Dots''. He gave this maquette to Carmen Segretario, founder and owner of the Segr\u00e9 Foundry of [[Waterbury, Connecticut]]. For decades, Calder had utilized the services of Segr\u00e9 Foundry in manufacturing his mobiles and stabiles. Each piece (no matter how many copies were made) would be initialled personally by Calder in white chalk, after which a welder would follow the chalk marks to burn the initials into the work. Calder died in 1976, without a full-size version of ''Two White Dots'' ever having been made. In 1982, Segretario constructed a full-size version of ''Two White Dots'', and sold it in 1983 to art dealer Shirley Teplitz for $70,000.

In 1995, [[Jon Shirley]] (the former president of [[Microsoft]] and a Calder collector) purchased ''Two White Dots'' for $1 million. When Shirley submitted the work to the Calder Foundation for inclusion in their catalogue raisonn\u00e9, the Foundation contested the work's authenticity. The [[Andr\u00e9 Emmerich|Andr\u00e9 Emmerich Gallery]] refunded Shirley's money, and sued the Segr\u00e9 Foundry, which sought [[bankruptcy]] protection. The suit was settled out of court in the late 1990s.

Traditional methods of [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purification]] of these compounds becomes time consuming and does not always produce entirely pure products.<ref name=garcia /> The ability to specialize a scavenger resin allows for significantly reduce purification times and more pure products.

This type of resin becomes swollen in a particular [[solvent]], allowing an impurity to react with a specified functional group.

The property that allows these types of resins to work efficiently lies in their [[porous]] properties.
