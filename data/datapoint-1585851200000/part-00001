The small peninsula is isolated from the rest of Moloka{{okina}}i by cliffs over a quarter-mile high&mdash;the only land access is a [[mule]] trail.\n\nBecause of the small population, Kalawao County does not have the functions of other Hawaii counties. Instead, it is a judicial district of [[Maui County, Hawaii|Maui County]], which includes the rest of the island of Moloka{{okina}}i. The county has no elected government.\n\nIt was developed and used from 1866 to 1969 for settlements for treatment of quarantined persons with [[Hansen's disease]] (leprosy).\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nThe [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]], the [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i]], the [[Territory of Hawaii|territory]], and the state of Hawaii exiled persons suffering from [[Hansen's disease]] to the peninsula, from 1866 to 1969. The [[quarantine]] policy was lifted after effective [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] treatments were developed that could be administered on an outpatient basis and patients could be rendered non-contagious.\n\nMany of the residents chose to remain on the peninsula, as they believed their disfigurements from the illness would make reintegration into society impossible. The state promised that they could live there for the rest of their lives. No new patients, or other permanent residents, were later admitted. Visitors are permitted only as part of official tours. State law prohibits anyone under the age of 16 from visiting or living there, although exceptions have been made for children visiting their relatives.\n\nThe [[Kalaupapa National Historical Park]] was established to preserve the county's history and environment. It is coterminous with the boundaries of Kalawao County.\n\n==Government==\nKalawao County lacks a local, county government. Instead, Kalawao County is administered by the [[Hawaii Department of Health]] because of the history of the settlement and current patients living there. Under Hawaiian state law, the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health, who is appointed by the [[Governor of Hawaii|Governor]], also serves as the [[Mayor of Kalawao County]].<ref name=hadvertiser>{{cite news|first=Robbie|last=Dingeman|title=Smallest county to ban smoking |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Oct/31/ln/ln22a.html |work=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |date=2002-10-31 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=time>{{cite news|first=Nate|last=Rawlings|title=Hawaii Official Killed in Plane Crash |url=http://nation.time.com/2013/12/12/hawaii-official-killed-in-plane-crash/ |work=[[Time Magazine]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=khon>{{cite news |first=Kristine |last=Uyeno |title=Hawaii Official Killed in Plane Crash |url=http://www.khon2.com/news/loretta-fuddy-committed-to-serving-others |work=[[KHON-TV|KHON]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104142321/http://www.khon2.com/news/loretta-fuddy-committed-to-serving-others |archivedate=2014-01-04 }}</ref><ref name=hsa>{{cite news |first=Gregg K. |last=Kakesako |title=Pilot described 'catastrophic engine failure' in Molokai crash |url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/235590541.html?id=235590541 |work=[[Honolulu Star Advertiser]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221154659/http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/235590541.html?id=235590541 |archivedate=2013-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The Mayor holds executive powers within the county; the mayor also appoints a county [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], who is selected from local residents.<ref name=\"doh\">{{cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/health/about/doh-info.html |title=Department of Health Administrative Offices |publisher=State of Hawai\u02bbi |accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref> The only county statutes that apply to Kalawao County directly are those on matters of health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/uham/counties.html|title=Hawaii's 4 (or 5) Counties|accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\nKalawao is part of the First Judicial Circuit, which includes the entire island of [[Oahu]].<ref>\"The Judiciary - State of Hawaii - Annual Report - July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987\". p16 and p26. https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/109520NCJRS.pdf</ref> For the purpose of notarization, the designated venue for the First Judicial Circuit is \"State of Hawaii, City and County of Honolulu.\"\n\n==Geography==\nKalawao County is included in the [[Kahului, Hawaii|Kahului]]-[[Wailuku, Hawaii|Wailuku]]-[[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]], HI [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|53|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|12|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|41|sqmi}} (77.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> By land area, it is the [[County statistics of the United States#Smallest counties by land area nationwide|smallest true county in the United States]]; [[Falls Church, Virginia]] is smaller, but is an [[independent city]] with county-level governance and is not a county or part of one.\n\n===Kalaupapa Peninsula===\nKalaupapa Peninsula contains the county's only settlement, [[Kalaupapa, Hawaii|Kalaupapa]].

Retrieved September 5, 2019.</ref> is the smallest county-equivalent in the U.S. by land area.}} The county encompasses the [[Kalaupapa Peninsula|Kalaupapa or Makanalua Peninsula]], on the north coast of the island of [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]]. The small peninsula is isolated from the rest of Moloka{{okina}}i by cliffs over a quarter-mile high&mdash;the only land access is a [[mule]] trail.\n\nBecause of the small population, Kalawao County does not have the functions of other Hawaii counties. Instead, it is a judicial district of [[Maui County, Hawaii|Maui County]], which includes the rest of the island of Moloka{{okina}}i. The county has no elected government.\n\nIt was developed and used from 1866 to 1969 for settlements for treatment of quarantined persons with [[Hansen's disease]] (leprosy).\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nThe [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]], the [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i]], the [[Territory of Hawaii|territory]], and the state of Hawaii exiled persons suffering from [[Hansen's disease]] to the peninsula, from 1866 to 1969. The [[quarantine]] policy was lifted after effective [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] treatments were developed that could be administered on an outpatient basis and patients could be rendered non-contagious.\n\nMany of the residents chose to remain on the peninsula, as they believed their disfigurements from the illness would make reintegration into society impossible. The state promised that they could live there for the rest of their lives. No new patients, or other permanent residents, were later admitted. Visitors are permitted only as part of official tours. State law prohibits anyone under the age of 16 from visiting or living there, although exceptions have been made for children visiting their relatives.\n\nThe [[Kalaupapa National Historical Park]] was established to preserve the county's history and environment. It is coterminous with the boundaries of Kalawao County.\n\n==Government==\nKalawao County lacks a local, county government. Instead, Kalawao County is administered by the [[Hawaii Department of Health]] because of the history of the settlement and current patients living there. Under Hawaiian state law, the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health, who is appointed by the [[Governor of Hawaii|Governor]], also serves as the [[Mayor of Kalawao County]].<ref name=hadvertiser>{{cite news|first=Robbie|last=Dingeman|title=Smallest county to ban smoking |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Oct/31/ln/ln22a.html |work=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |date=2002-10-31 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=time>{{cite news|first=Nate|last=Rawlings|title=Hawaii Official Killed in Plane Crash |url=http://nation.time.com/2013/12/12/hawaii-official-killed-in-plane-crash/ |work=[[Time Magazine]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=khon>{{cite news |first=Kristine |last=Uyeno |title=Hawaii Official Killed in Plane Crash |url=http://www.khon2.com/news/loretta-fuddy-committed-to-serving-others |work=[[KHON-TV|KHON]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104142321/http://www.khon2.com/news/loretta-fuddy-committed-to-serving-others |archivedate=2014-01-04 }}</ref><ref name=hsa>{{cite news |first=Gregg K. |last=Kakesako |title=Pilot described 'catastrophic engine failure' in Molokai crash |url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/235590541.html?id=235590541 |work=[[Honolulu Star Advertiser]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221154659/http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/235590541.html?id=235590541 |archivedate=2013-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The Mayor holds executive powers within the county; the mayor also appoints a county [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], who is selected from local residents.<ref name=\"doh\">{{cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/health/about/doh-info.html |title=Department of Health Administrative Offices |publisher=State of Hawai\u02bbi |accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref> The only county statutes that apply to Kalawao County directly are those on matters of health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/uham/counties.html|title=Hawaii's 4 (or 5) Counties|accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\nKalawao is part of the First Judicial Circuit, which includes the entire island of [[Oahu]].<ref>\"The Judiciary - State of Hawaii - Annual Report - July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987\". p16 and p26. https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/109520NCJRS.pdf</ref> For the purpose of notarization, the designated venue for the First Judicial Circuit is \"State of Hawaii, City and County of Honolulu.\"\n\n==Geography==\nKalawao County is included in the [[Kahului, Hawaii|Kahului]]-[[Wailuku, Hawaii|Wailuku]]-[[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]], HI [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|53|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|12|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|41|sqmi}} (77.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> By land area, it is the [[County statistics of the United States#Smallest counties by land area nationwide|smallest true county in the United States]]; [[Falls Church, Virginia]] is smaller, but is an [[independent city]] with county-level governance and is not a county or part of one.\n\n===Kalaupapa Peninsula===\nKalaupapa Peninsula contains the county's only settlement, [[Kalaupapa, Hawaii|Kalaupapa]].
