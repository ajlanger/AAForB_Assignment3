Against the wishes of her mother ([[Neena Kulkarni]]) and brother, Mira gets married to Akash. Akash and Mira start a life full of love. Once Rahul ([[Yash Pathak]]) is born Mira's family forgives them. Akash has his own small business of travel. He is dedicated to working but would not earn money by cheating. On Rahul's first birthday Akash gives Mira the permission of inviting her family. At the venue, Mira's family comes along and Mira's brother ([[Manish Wadhwa]]) insults Akash to the core. This infuriates Akash and he hits Mira's brother. Mira asks Akash to apologise to her brother, which the former refuses. Mira's family forcibly takes her away from Akash. She is also forced to leave behind her son Rahul. Akash and Mira get divorced in the court and fearing that Akash might take her life in absence of Rahul, Mira is forced to give the custody of her only child to Akash, until he is at least five years old.\n\nRahul who had been so long living with his father misses his mother very much. His father has infiltrated the idea in him that his mother is very bad. However, he finds out from Uncle John ([[Gulshan Grover]]) that Mira is very good and that she lives in [[Mahabaleshwar]] with her parents. Rahul secretly goes and meets her, after which he finds out that his mother is very loving and caring towards him. Rahul and Mira continue to meet each other secretly. Meanwhile, Rahul falls ill quite often, which leads others including the family doctor to suggest that Akash goes for a second marriage with Sheila ([[Rajeshwari Sachdev]]). Sheila cares for Rahul too. Akash initially refuses but eventually agrees for the sake of Rahul. Rahul likes Sheila but cannot take her to be his mother. Mira comes to know the fact that Akash is getting ready for a second marriage. Mira's family also wants her to marry Naveen ([[Mahesh Thakur]]).\n\nOne day Akash finds out that Mira and Rahul are in touch. He forces the kid to tell Mira that he hates her. This creates a tremendous pressure on Rahul's mind who gets drenched in rain and falls sick. This leads Akash and Mira to come to the hospital and confront each other. Mira then realizes that her family had been selfish all along and that Akash was not at fault. After Rahul is treated, the two get united for the sake of Rahul.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yash Pathak]] as Rahul Sharma \n* [[Jatin Grewal]] as Akash Sharma \n* [[Neha (actress)|Neha Bajpai]] as Mira Singh \n* [[Rajeshwari Sachdev]] as Sheila Singh as Rahul's teacher  \n* [[Mahesh Thakur]] as Naveen Malhotra\n* [[Gulshan Grover]] as Uncle John \n* [[Parikshat Sahni]] as Doctor Uncle \n* [[Manish Wadhwa]] as Rohit\n* [[Neena Kulkarni]] as Mrs. Singh \n* [[Isha Koppikar]] as Special appearance in item number\n* Tanvi Hegde as Isha\n* [[Rita Joshi]]\n* [[Sudhir Mishra]]\n* [[Vrajesh Hirjee]] as Isha's father\n* Anil Nagrath\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music is composed by [[Anu Malik]] while the lyrics are penned by [[Anand Bakshi]].\n\n===Track listing===\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Singer(s)\n| title1 = A Song To Sing\n| extra1 = [[Maria Goretti (actress)|Maria Goretti]]\n| lyrics1 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length1 =\n| title2 = Chalti Hai Purvai\n| extra2 = [[Alka Yagnik]], [[Mahalakshmi Iyer]]\n| lyrics2 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length2 =\n| title3 = Ched Na Mujhko\n| extra3 = [[Hariharan (singer)|Hariharan]], [[Kavita Krishnamurthy]]\n| lyrics3 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length3 =\n| title4 =  Eh Kaash Aisa Hota\n| extra4 = [[Ustad Sultan Khan]]\n| lyrics4 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length4 =\n| title5 = Kaise Bhool Jaati Hai\n| extra5 = Sonali Bajpai\n| lyrics5 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length5 =\n| title6 = Piya Ki Jogan\n| extra6 = [[Sunidhi Chauhan]], [[Richa Sharma (singer)|Richa Sharma]]\n| lyrics6 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length6 =\n| title7 = Tu Mujhe Kaise Bhool Jaata Hai\n| extra7 = [[Alka Yagnik]]\n| lyrics7 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length7 =\n| title8 =  Vah Re Vah\n| extra8 = [[Roop Kumar Rathod]], Deepali Somaiya\n| lyrics8 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length8 =\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|tt0277981|Rahul}}\n{{Subhash Ghai}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rahul (Film)}}\n[[Category:2000s Hindi-language films]]\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Prakash Jha]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:Indian drama films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Anu Malik]]\n[[Category:Films featuring an item number]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2001 film by Prakash Jha}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Rahul\n| image          = Rahul 2001 film.jpg\n| caption        = Poster\n| director       = [[Prakash Jha]]\n| producer       = [[Subhash Ghai]]\n| screenplay     = Anuradha Tiwari\n| starring       = [[Jatin Grewal ]]<br />[[Neha (actress)|Neha]]<br />[[Rajeshwari Sachdev]]\n| music          = [[Anu Malik]]\n| cinematography = Arvind K.\n| editing        = Onir\n| distributor    = [[Mukta Arts]]\n| released       = 6 April 2001\n| runtime        =\n| country        = India\n| language       = Hindi\n| budget         = \n| gross          =\n}}\n\n'''Rahul''' is a [[Bollywood films of 2001|2001]] [[India]]n film directed and produced by [[Prakash Jha]].<ref>[http://ibnlive.in.com/photogallery/4536-7.html/ Hip Hip Hurray to Aarakshan: The best of director Prakash Jha]</ref> The film stars [[Neha (actress)|Neha]], [[Jatin Grewal]] and [[Yash Pathak]]  in lead roles.\n\n==Synopsis==\nMira ([[Shabana Raza|Neha]]) comes from a very wealthy family, however, she wants to get married to Akash Sharma ([[Jatin Grewal]]), who is not so wealthy.
