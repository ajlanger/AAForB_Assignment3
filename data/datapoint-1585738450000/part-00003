After the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], the [[Department of Social Security (United Kingdom)|Department of Social Security]] was abolished and replaced with the new [[Department for Work and Pensions]], which also took employment away from the education portfolio.

He was responsible for the [[Railways Act 2005]] which abolished the [[Strategic Rail Authority]], a creation of the Labour government under the [[Transport Act 2000]].

This included threats that had been made to the independent Rail Regulator that if he intervened to defend the company against the government's attempts to force it into railway administration \u2013 a special status for insolvent railway companies \u2013 the government would introduce emergency legislation to take the regulator under direct political control. This stance by Darling surprised many observers, because during his tenure at the Department for Transport, he had made several statements to Parliament and the financial markets assuring them that the government regarded independence in economic regulation of the railways as essential.\n\n===Secretary of State for Scotland===\nIn 2003, when the [[Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland|Scotland Office]] was folded into the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]], he was appointed [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Scottish Secretary]] in combination with his Transport portfolio.\n\n===Secretary of State for Trade and Industry===\nIn the [[Cabinet reshuffle]] of May 2006, he was moved to be [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]; [[Douglas Alexander]] replaced him as both [[Secretary of State for Transport]] and [[Secretary |Secretary of State for Scotland]].

The [[Subprime mortgage crisis|2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis]] had caused a liquidity crisis in the UK banking industry, and Northern Rock was unable to borrow as required by its business model.

After the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], the [[Department of Social Security (United Kingdom)|Department of Social Security]] was abolished and replaced with the new [[Department for Work and Pensions]], which also took employment away from the education portfolio. Darling fronted the new department until 2002 when he was moved to the [[Department for Transport]], after his predecessor [[Stephen Byers]] resigned.\n\n===Secretary of State for Transport===\nDarling was given a brief to \"take the department out of the headlines\". He oversaw the creation of [[Network Rail]], the successor to [[Railtrack]], which had collapsed in controversial circumstances for which his predecessor was largely blamed. He also procured the passage of the legislation \u2013 the [[Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003]] \u2013 which abolished the [[Rail Regulator]] and replaced him with the [[Office of Rail Regulation]]. He was responsible for the [[Railways Act 2005]] which abolished the [[Strategic Rail Authority]], a creation of the Labour government under the [[Transport Act 2000]].

This included threats that had been made to the independent Rail Regulator that if he intervened to defend the company against the government's attempts to force it into railway administration \u2013 a special status for insolvent railway companies \u2013 the government would introduce emergency legislation to take the regulator under direct political control. This stance by Darling surprised many observers, because during his tenure at the Department for Transport, he had made several statements to Parliament and the financial markets assuring them that the government regarded independence in economic regulation of the railways as essential.\n\n===Secretary of State for Scotland===\nIn 2003, when the [[Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland|Scotland Office]] was folded into the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]], he was appointed [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Scottish Secretary]] in combination with his Transport portfolio.\n\n===Secretary of State for Trade and Industry===\nIn the [[Cabinet reshuffle]] of May 2006, he was moved to be [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]; [[Douglas Alexander]] replaced him as both [[Secretary of State for Transport]] and [[Secretary |Secretary of State for Scotland]]. On 10 November 2006 in a mini-reshuffle, [[Malcolm Wicks]], the Minister for Energy at the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], and thus one of Darling's junior ministers, was appointed Minister for Science.

Although the [[Bank of England]] and the [[Financial Services Authority]] have jurisdiction in such cases, ultimate authority for deciding on financial support for a bank in exceptional circumstances rests with the Chancellor. The [[Subprime mortgage crisis|2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis]] had caused a liquidity crisis in the UK banking industry, and Northern Rock was unable to borrow as required by its business model. Darling authorised the Bank of England to lend Northern Rock funds to cover its liabilities and provided an unqualified taxpayers' guarantee of the deposits of savers in Northern Rock to try to stop the run.
