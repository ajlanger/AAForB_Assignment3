Abramowitz approaches the understanding and treatment of psychological problems from a [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral perspective]].\n\n==Academic career==\nAbramowitz earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Psychology from [[Muhlenberg College]] in 1991, his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Psychology from [[Bucknell University]] in 1993, and his [[Ph.D.]] in Clinical Psychology from the [[University of Memphis]] in 1998. He completed both a predoctoral internship and postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He was a staff psychologist and Associate Professor at the [[Mayo Clinic]] ([[Rochester, Minnesota]]) from 2000 until 2006. He moved to [[North Carolina]] in the summer of 2006.\n\nAbramowitz's research focuses on the development and evaluation of [[cognitive-behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral treatments]] (CBT) for OCD and other anxiety-related problems, as well as on understanding the nature and psychopathology of these problems. He is the author of approximately 300 publications, including more than 10 books and over 250 peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters. He has also worked extensively as a book and journal editor. Abramowitz has given invited lectures around the world and served in numerous editorial and advisory roles for scientific journals and organizations.\n\nAbramowitz is board certified by the [[American Board of Professional Psychology|American Board of Behavioral Psychology]] and is a licensed psychologist in North Carolina. In his clinical practice, he specializes in providing outpatient consultation and cognitive-behavioral treatment of OCD and other anxiety-related problems.\n\n==Research areas and contributions==\n[[File:JA lecturing.jpg|left|thumb|259x259px|Abramowitz lecturing in Bergen, Norway]]\nTreatment of OCD and anxiety: A major focus of Abramowitz's research is the treatment of OCD. His work primarily addresses [[exposure and response prevention]] (ERP; a form of [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral therapy]] [CBT]) and he has conducted treatment outcome studies

Abramowitz approaches the understanding and treatment of psychological problems from a [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral perspective]].\n\n==Academic career==\nAbramowitz earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Psychology from [[Muhlenberg College]] in 1991, his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Psychology from [[Bucknell University]] in 1993, and his [[Ph.D.]] in Clinical Psychology from the [[University of Memphis]] in 1998. He completed both a predoctoral internship and postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He was a staff psychologist and Associate Professor at the [[Mayo Clinic]] ([[Rochester, Minnesota]]) from 2000 until 2006. He moved to [[North Carolina]] in the summer of 2006.\n\nAbramowitz's research focuses on the development and evaluation of [[cognitive-behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral treatments]] (CBT) for OCD and other anxiety-related problems, as well as on understanding the nature and psychopathology of these problems. He is the author of approximately 300 publications, including more than 10 books and over 250 peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters. He has also worked extensively as a book and journal editor. Abramowitz has given invited lectures around the world and served in numerous editorial and advisory roles for scientific journals and organizations.\n\nAbramowitz is board certified by the [[American Board of Professional Psychology|American Board of Behavioral Psychology]] and is a licensed psychologist in North Carolina. In his clinical practice, he specializes in providing outpatient consultation and cognitive-behavioral treatment of OCD and other anxiety-related problems.\n\n==Research areas and contributions==\n[[File:JA lecturing.jpg|left|thumb|259x259px|Abramowitz lecturing in Bergen, Norway]]\nTreatment of OCD and anxiety: A major focus of Abramowitz's research is the treatment of OCD. His work primarily addresses [[exposure and response prevention]] (ERP; a form of [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral therapy]] [CBT]) and he has conducted treatment outcome studies
