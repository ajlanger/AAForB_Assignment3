She was the third ''Phoenix'' of the [[United States Navy]]. After [[World War II]] the ship was transferred to [[Argentina]] in 1951 and was ultimately renamed {{ship|ARA|General Belgrano||2}} in 1956.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}} ''General Belgrano'' was sunk during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 by the British nuclear-powered submarine {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}}, the only ship to have been sunk in combat by a nuclear-powered submarine during wartime.\n\nShe was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 15 April 1935 by the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]], [[Camden, New Jersey]]; [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 13 March 1938; sponsored by Mrs. Dorothea Kays Moonan; and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] at [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] on 3 October 1938, Captain [[John W. Rankin]] in command. Her name was in honor of the [[Phoenix, Arizona|capital city]] of the state of [[Arizona]].{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n==Service history==\nShakedown took her to [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]]. She continued to [[Santos (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Santos]], Brazil, then to [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, to [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, and finally to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. The new cruiser returned to Philadelphia in January 1939.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}} In March 1939 she transited the Panama Canal for new home port of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro, California]]. From June 1939 until April 1940, she toured the west coast with port of call in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] and [[San Francisco]], California, [[Portland, Oregon]], and points in between. During March 1940 she was en route to Lahaina Roads, Maui and then on to new home port of [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii.\n\n===World War II===\n====Pearl Harbor and convoy operations====\n[[File:USS Phoenix (CL-46) steams down the channel at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 (NH 50766).jpg|thumb|left|''Phoenix'' passing the battleships {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}} and {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|2}} at [[Pearl Harbor]] in 1941.]]\n\n''Phoenix'' then operated off the West Coast and was later based at Pearl Harbor. On 7 December 1941 during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] she was anchored north east of [[Ford Island]] near {{USS|Solace|AH-5|2}}. Observers on board ''Phoenix'' sighted the rising sun of Japan on planes coming in low over Ford Island and a few seconds later the ship's guns took them under fire. ''Phoenix'' escaped the disaster unharmed and shortly after noon was underway to join the cruisers {{USS|St. Louis|CL-49|2}} and {{USS|Detroit|CL-8|2}} and several [[destroyer]]s in an impromptu [[task force]] searching, unsuccessfully, for the enemy [[aircraft carrier]]s.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Phoenix'' next escorted the first [[convoy]] to the United States from Pearl Harbor after the attack and returned at once with another convoy.\n\nOn 12 January 1942 ''Phoenix'' with two destroyers departed [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] escorting the \"Australian \u2014 Suva\" convoy composed of the  troopships {{SS|Mariposa}}, {{SS|President Coolidge}} for [[Melbourne]] and {{USS|President Monroe|AP-104|2}} (destined for [[Suva]]) in the first large convoy to Australia after Pearl Harbor.{{sfn|Nimitz| volume 1: 7 December 1941 \u2013 1 September 1942 |p. 155 Entries 12 January 1942}}{{sfn|Mayo|1968|pp=40\u201341}} Of particular significance this convoy were the troops, fifty crated [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]] fighter aircraft intended for the Philippines and Java, munitions, supplies and the officers selected by the War Department to form the core of what was to become MacArthur's headquarters in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area Command]] being formed in Australia as United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA), known as the \"Remember Pearl Harbor\" Group.{{sfn|Mayo|1968|pp=40\u201341}} For some time the cruiser operated in Australian waters escorting troop ships, once steaming as far north as [[Java (island)|Java]].{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Phoenix'' escorted the United States Army Transport {{USAT|Willard A. Holbrook|3=2}} and the Australian transports {{MV|Duntroon|3=2}} and {{SS|Katoomba|1913|2}}, which had been substituted for the withdrawn ''Mariposa'', as convoy MS.5 leaving Melbourne 12 February for Fremantle and ultimately bound for [[Colombo, Ceylon]] with troops and supplies destined for India.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=601\u2013602}} At Fremantle the aircraft carrier {{USS|Langley|CV-1|2}} and merchant vessel {{MS|Sea Witch|1940|2}} joined the convoy with a 22 February departure for Colombo.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=601\u2013602}}  Of particular note in the cargo of the convoy and specifically that of ''Langley'' and ''Sea Witch'' were P-40 aircraft, originally intended for the Philippines, that had been delivered to Australia earlier by ''Mariposa'' and ''President Coolidge'' in the convoy escorted by ''Phoenix'' from San Francisco.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=601\u2013602}}{{sfn|Matloff|1953\u201359|p=132}} The plan had been that on relief of ''Phoenix'' by a British cruiser in the vicinity of [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Island]] she would escort ''Langley'' and ''Sea Witch'' to Java.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=601\u2013602}} Instead ''Langley'' and ''Sea Witch'' were destined to break with the convoy for [[Tjilatjap]], Java under orders from [[Conrad Helfrich|Admiral Helfrich]] received the day after departure from Fremantle and proceed independently to deliver their aircraft.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=601\u2013602}}{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1948|pp=397\u2013398}}{{sfn|Morison|1947\u201362|p= 359}} ''Langley'' was attacked and sunk on 27 February. ''Sea Witch'' successfully made delivery on 28 February just as the results of the [[Battle of the Java Sea]] had sealed the fate of the islands. The crated planes delivered were destroyed before assembly to deny them to the enemy.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1948|pp=397\u2013398}} ''Phoenix'' turned over escort of the Colombo bound ships about 300 miles west of Cocos Island to {{HMS|Enterprise |D52|6}} on  28 February and returned to Fremantle on 5 March 1942.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=601\u2013602}}\n\nDuring the following months, ''Phoenix'' patrolled in the Indian Ocean, escorted a convoy to [[Bombay]], and was present at the evacuation of Java.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nUnder the command of Captain [[Joseph Redman|Joseph R. Redman]], ''Phoenix'' was a part of [[Task Force 44]] in late 1942. With her accompanying destroyers {{USS|Helm|DD-388|2}}, {{USS|Mugford|DD-389|2}} and {{USS|Patterson|DD-392|2}}, she participated in [[Operation Lilliput|Operation ''Lilliput'']], alternating with the Australian light cruiser {{HMAS|Hobart|1934|6}} and her accompanying destroyers to cover the convoys south of New Guinea.<ref>Bruce T. Swain, A Chronology of Australian Armed Forces at War, 1939\u201345 (Allan & Unwin, 2001): 215</ref>\n\n''Phoenix'' departed [[Brisbane, Queensland, Australia]] for overhaul in the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] in July 1943 before carrying Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] to [[Casablanca]]. She was then assigned to the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] and sailed for the South Pacific.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n====South Pacific operations====\nOn 26 December, in company with the cruiser {{USS|Nashville|CL-43|2}}, she bombarded the [[Cape Gloucester (Papua New Guinea)|Cape Gloucester]] area of [[New Britain]], smashing shore installations in a four-hour shelling. ''Phoenix'' covered landing forces as they went ashore and furnished support fire against enemy strong points which had not been demolished. On the night of 25\u201326 January 1944, the ship took part in a night raid on [[Madang]] and [[Alexishafen]], [[New Guinea]], shelling shore installations.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n[[File:Vice Admiral Kinkaid and General MacArthur on board USS Phoenix (CL-46), 28 February 1944 (SC 188839).jpg|thumb|left|Vice Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]] (left center) with General Douglas MacArthur (center) on the flag bridge of ''Phoenix'' during the pre-invasion bombardment of Los Negros Island.]]\n''Phoenix'' then moved to the [[Admiralty Islands]] to support the [[US 1st Cavalry Division|1st Cavalry Division]] in a reconnaissance-in-force on [[Los Negros Island]] on 29 February. When the troops went ashore after the prelanding bombardment, enemy resistance was so weak that a withdrawal was not necessary and the island was occupied.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}} General [[Douglas MacArthur]] was on board during the course of the operations.<ref>Benge, Janet and Benge, Geoff (2005). ''Douglas MacArthur: what greater honor''. YWAM Publishing, p. 134. {{ISBN|1-932096-15-9}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 and 7 March, ''Phoenix'', ''Nashville'', and {{HMAS|Shropshire|1928|6}} bombarded Hauwei Island (just west of [[Los Negros Island]]) of the Admiralty Group. Enemy guns on this island had threatened [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] positions in the Admiralties, particularly on [[Manus Island]]; and, although return fire from the beach was heavy, enemy batteries ceased firing when shells from the cruisers burst in their vicinity.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nIn the [[Battle of Hollandia]], , the start of the [[Western New Guinea campaign]], [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] was next to fall to the mounting amphibious offensive. This largest assault till then undertaken by American forces, was launched by 200 ships. ''Phoenix'' shelled the shore in the [[Yos Sudarso Bay|Humboldt Bay]]-Hollandia area as the troops went ashore on 22 April, and supported them as they consolidated their gains and prepared for further attacks along the northwest coast of the big island. ''Phoenix'' shelled the [[Wakde Airfield|Wakde]] and [[Battle of Lone Tree Hill|Sawar Airfields]] on the night of 29\u201330 April to neutralize the danger of air attack on newly-won Allied positions on New Guinea.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur's troops next landed at Arare on 17 May to secure airfields to support further operations in the [[Netherlands New Guinea]] area. This beachhead was later extended to include [[Wakde Island]] by a shore to shore movement of troops. ''Phoenix'' bombarded the Toem area and escorted the troops to the landing beach.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nThe amphibious [[Battle of Biak]] followed. There, MacArthur planned to establish a forward base for heavy bombers. With ''Nashville'' and {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}}, ''Phoenix'' sortied from Humboldt Bay on 25 May and two days later supported the landing. While the task force fired on shore installations, two of the escorting destroyers were hit by shells from shore batteries. ''Phoenix'' wiped out the gun emplacement with two salvos from her [[5\"/25 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}}/25 cal]] batteries.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nOn 4 June, off the northwest coast of New Guinea, eight Japanese [[Strike fighter|fighter bomber]]s attacked ''Phoenix'''s task force. Two confined their attention to ''Phoenix''. Although the ship's gunfire did not hit the planes, it diverted their bomb runs. Both planes dropped bombs, one of which burst in the water close to ''Phoenix'', killing one man and wounding four others with fragments. The ship also suffered some underwater leakage and damage to her propellers. The following night, aircraft again attacked ''Phoenix''. This time, low-flying [[torpedo bomber]]s struck as she proceeded through Yapen Strait, between Biak and [[Yapen]] islands, but her gunfire and evasive tactics prevented damage.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Phoenix'' and her task force frustrated an enemy attempt to reinforce their garrisons on the night of 8\u20139 June. When they contacted the American ships, the Japanese destroyers turned and fled at such high speed that only one US destroyer division was able to get within firing range. After a running fight of three hours at long range, ''Phoenix'' and her sisters broke off action.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nWith ''Boise'' and ten destroyers, ''Phoenix'' sortied from [[Seeadler Harbor]] in the Admiralties and bombarded shore defenses before American forces landed on [[Noemfoor Island]] on 2 July. After the battle, many dead Japanese and wrecked planes were found in the target area assigned to ''Phoenix''.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Boise'', ''Nashville'', ''Shropshire'', ''Phoenix'' and {{HMAS|Australia|1927|6}} joined for the occupation of [[Morotai]] in the [[Molucca Islands]] on 15 September. The cruisers shelled nearby [[Halmahera Island]] to cover the landing and protect the assault forces as they went ashore against continuing light opposition.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n====Philippines campaign====\nThe long-awaited re-conquest of the [[Philippines]] began with the landing on [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]]. ''Phoenix'', attached to the Close Covering Group, heavily bombarded the beaches before the highly successful landing on 20 October. Her batteries silenced an enemy strong point holding up the advance of a battalion of the [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry Regiment]] and continued to furnish effective callfire.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nIn the [[battle of Leyte Gulf]], ''Phoenix'' was a unit of Rear Admiral [[Jesse Oldendorf]]'s group which annihilated the Japanese Southern Force in the [[battle of Surigao Strait]]. ''Phoenix'' fired four spotting salvoes, and when the fourth hit, opened up with all of her 6-inch (152 mm) batteries. The target later proved to be {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}}, which sank after 27 minutes of concentrated fire from the American fleet. The Japanese also lost {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Fus\u014d||2}} and three destroyers in the battle, and American planes sank {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Mogami|1934|2}} the next day.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Phoenix'' then patrolled the mouth of [[Leyte Gulf]] to protect Allied positions on shore. On the morning of 1 November 1944, ten enemy torpedo-bombers attacked her and accompanying ships. At 0945, ''Phoenix'' opened fire and five minutes later, {{USS|Claxton|DD-571|2}} was hit by a ''[[kamikaze]]''. Almost at the same instant, hits from ''Phoenix''{{'}}s {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns set another plane afire but could not prevent it from diving into the starboard bow of {{USS|Ammen|DD-527|2}}. At 0957, a plane making a torpedo run on ''Phoenix'' was shot down by the ship's machine-gun fire, but in a few minutes a bomber hit {{USS|Killen|DD-593|2}}.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nAfter a lull of two and a half hours, more ''kamikazes'' arrived and, at 1340, scored a hit on the destroyer {{USS|Abner Read|DD-526|2}}. Japanese aircraft attacked the other destroyers as they stood by the sinking ship, but ''Phoenix'' shot down one of the raiders.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Phoenix'' was attacked again by enemy planes on 5 December and was credited with assisting in the destruction of two attackers. Five days later, a ''kamikaze'' attempted to crash into the ship but was brought down by 40&nbsp;mm fire when only {{convert|100|yd|m|-2|abbr=on}} away. It was at this time ''Phoenix'' suffered her only wartime fatality.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nWhile proceeding to the assault area off [[Mindoro]] on 13 December, the ship was constantly under air attack by single ''kamikazes''. That day, a lone ''kamikaze'' hit ''Nashville''. On 15 December, a 5-inch (127&nbsp;mm) shell from ''Phoenix'' brought down a circling plane at {{convert|8,500|yd|km}}. The ship then furnished her usual fire support and covered the landing forces. This gave the Allies a base from which to strike at Japan's shipping lanes through the [[South China Sea]] and to soften up [[Luzon]] for forthcoming landings.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nEn route to [[Lingayen Gulf]] for the invasion of Luzon, lookouts on board ''Phoenix'' sighted the [[conning tower]] of a diving [[submarine]] in the [[Mindanao Sea]] off [[Siquijor]]. The submarine submerged and fired two torpedoes which ''Phoenix'' dodged. {{USS|Taylor|DD-468|2}} blew the midget sub to the surface and rammed her.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n====End of the war====\n''Phoenix'' covered minesweeping operations at [[Balikpapan]], [[Borneo]], from 29 June to 7 July. Resistance from coastal guns was unusually heavy. Mines and shellfire sank or damaged 11 [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]]. ''Phoenix'' furnished supporting fire and the assault waves landed. Next came [[Bataan]] and [[Corregidor]], taken from 13\u201328 February 1945.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Phoenix'' was en route to Pearl Harbor for overhaul when Japan capitulated. She headed home and, upon reaching the [[Panama Canal]] on 6 September, joined the [[United States Fleet Forces Command#World War II|Atlantic Fleet]]. Her status was reduced to in commission, in reserve, at Philadelphia on 28 February 1946.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n==Argentine service==\n[[File:US Navy 070502-N-4021H-082 USS Pearl Harbor (LSD 52) Commanding Officer, Cmdr.

She was the third ''Phoenix'' of the [[United States Navy]]. After [[World War II]] the ship was transferred to [[Argentina]] in 1951 and was ultimately renamed {{ship|ARA|General Belgrano||2}} in 1956.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}} ''General Belgrano'' was sunk during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 by the British nuclear-powered submarine {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}}, the only ship to have been sunk in combat by a nuclear-powered submarine during wartime.\n\nShe was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 15 April 1935 by the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]], [[Camden, New Jersey]]; [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 13 March 1938; sponsored by Mrs. Dorothea Kays Moonan; and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] at [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] on 3 October 1938, Captain [[John W. Rankin]] in command. Her name was in honor of the [[Phoenix, Arizona|capital city]] of the state of [[Arizona]].{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n==Service history==\nShakedown took her to [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]]. She continued to [[Santos (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Santos]], Brazil, then to [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, to [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, and finally to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. The new cruiser returned to Philadelphia in January 1939.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}} In March 1939 she transited the Panama Canal for new home port of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro, California]]. From June 1939 until April 1940, she toured the west coast with port of call in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] and [[San Francisco]], California, [[Portland, Oregon]], and points in between. During March 1940 she was en route to Lahaina Roads, Maui and then on to new home port of [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii.\n\n===World War II===\n====Pearl Harbor and convoy operations====\n[[File:USS Phoenix (CL-46) steams down the channel at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 (NH 50766).jpg|thumb|left|''Phoenix'' passing the battleships {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}} and {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|2}} at [[Pearl Harbor]] in 1941.]]\n\n''Phoenix'' then operated off the West Coast and was later based at Pearl Harbor. On 7 December 1941 during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] she was anchored north east of [[Ford Island]] near {{USS|Solace|AH-5|2}}. Observers on board ''Phoenix'' sighted the rising sun of Japan on planes coming in low over Ford Island and a few seconds later the ship's guns took them under fire. ''Phoenix'' escaped the disaster unharmed and shortly after noon was underway to join the cruisers {{USS|St. Louis|CL-49|2}} and {{USS|Detroit|CL-8|2}} and several [[destroyer]]s in an impromptu [[task force]] searching, unsuccessfully, for the enemy [[aircraft carrier]]s.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Phoenix'' next escorted the first [[convoy]] to the United States from Pearl Harbor after the attack and returned at once with another convoy.\n\nOn 12 January 1942 ''Phoenix'' with two destroyers departed [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] escorting the \"Australian \u2014 Suva\" convoy composed of the  troopships {{SS|Mariposa}}, {{SS|President Coolidge}} for [[Melbourne]] and {{USS|President Monroe|AP-104|2}} (destined for [[Suva]]) in the first large convoy to Australia after Pearl Harbor.{{sfn|Nimitz| volume 1: 7 December 1941 \u2013 1 September 1942 |p. 155 Entries 12 January 1942}}{{sfn|Mayo|1968|pp=40\u201341}} Of particular significance this convoy were the troops, fifty crated [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]] fighter aircraft intended for the Philippines and Java, munitions, supplies and the officers selected by the War Department to form the core of what was to become MacArthur's headquarters in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area Command]] being formed in Australia as United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA), known as the \"Remember Pearl Harbor\" Group.{{sfn|Mayo|1968|pp=40\u201341}} For some time the cruiser operated in Australian waters escorting troop ships, once steaming as far north as [[Java (island)|Java]].{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Phoenix'' escorted the United States Army Transport {{USAT|Willard A. Holbrook|3=2}} and the Australian transports {{MV|Duntroon|3=2}} and {{SS|Katoomba|1913|2}}, which had been substituted for the withdrawn ''Mariposa'', as convoy MS.5 leaving Melbourne 12 February for Fremantle and ultimately bound for [[Colombo, Ceylon]] with troops and supplies destined for India.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=601\u2013602}} At Fremantle the aircraft carrier {{USS|Langley|CV-1|2}} and merchant vessel {{MS|Sea Witch|1940|2}} joined the convoy with a 22 February departure for Colombo.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=601\u2013602}}  Of particular note in the cargo of the convoy and specifically that of ''Langley'' and ''Sea Witch'' were P-40 aircraft, originally intended for the Philippines, that had been delivered to Australia earlier by ''Mariposa'' and ''President Coolidge'' in the convoy escorted by ''Phoenix'' from San Francisco.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=601\u2013602}}{{sfn|Matloff|1953\u201359|p=132}} The plan had been that on relief of ''Phoenix'' by a British cruiser in the vicinity of [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Island]] she would escort ''Langley'' and ''Sea Witch'' to Java.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=601\u2013602}} Instead ''Langley'' and ''Sea Witch'' were destined to break with the convoy for [[Tjilatjap]], Java under orders from [[Conrad Helfrich|Admiral Helfrich]] received the day after departure from Fremantle and proceed independently to deliver their aircraft.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=601\u2013602}}{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1948|pp=397\u2013398}}{{sfn|Morison|1947\u201362|p= 359}} ''Langley'' was attacked and sunk on 27 February. ''Sea Witch'' successfully made delivery on 28 February just as the results of the [[Battle of the Java Sea]] had sealed the fate of the islands. The crated planes delivered were destroyed before assembly to deny them to the enemy.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1948|pp=397\u2013398}} ''Phoenix'' turned over escort of the Colombo bound ships about 300 miles west of Cocos Island to {{HMS|Enterprise |D52|6}} on  28 February and returned to Fremantle on 5 March 1942.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=601\u2013602}}\n\nDuring the following months, ''Phoenix'' patrolled in the Indian Ocean, escorted a convoy to [[Bombay]], and was present at the evacuation of Java.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nUnder the command of Captain [[Joseph Redman|Joseph R. Redman]], ''Phoenix'' was a part of [[Task Force 44]] in late 1942. With her accompanying destroyers {{USS|Helm|DD-388|2}}, {{USS|Mugford|DD-389|2}} and {{USS|Patterson|DD-392|2}}, she participated in [[Operation Lilliput|Operation ''Lilliput'']], alternating with the Australian light cruiser {{HMAS|Hobart|1934|6}} and her accompanying destroyers to cover the convoys south of New Guinea.<ref>Bruce T. Swain, A Chronology of Australian Armed Forces at War, 1939\u201345 (Allan & Unwin, 2001): 215</ref>\n\n''Phoenix'' departed [[Brisbane, Queensland, Australia]] for overhaul in the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] in July 1943 before carrying Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] to [[Casablanca]]. She was then assigned to the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] and sailed for the South Pacific.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n====South Pacific operations====\nOn 26 December, in company with the cruiser {{USS|Nashville|CL-43|2}}, she bombarded the [[Cape Gloucester (Papua New Guinea)|Cape Gloucester]] area of [[New Britain]], smashing shore installations in a four-hour shelling. ''Phoenix'' covered landing forces as they went ashore and furnished support fire against enemy strong points which had not been demolished. On the night of 25\u201326 January 1944, the ship took part in a night raid on [[Madang]] and [[Alexishafen]], [[New Guinea]], shelling shore installations.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n[[File:Vice Admiral Kinkaid and General MacArthur on board USS Phoenix (CL-46), 28 February 1944 (SC 188839).jpg|thumb|left|Vice Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]] (left center) with General Douglas MacArthur (center) on the flag bridge of ''Phoenix'' during the pre-invasion bombardment of Los Negros Island.]]\n''Phoenix'' then moved to the [[Admiralty Islands]] to support the [[US 1st Cavalry Division|1st Cavalry Division]] in a reconnaissance-in-force on [[Los Negros Island]] on 29 February. When the troops went ashore after the prelanding bombardment, enemy resistance was so weak that a withdrawal was not necessary and the island was occupied.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}} General [[Douglas MacArthur]] was on board during the course of the operations.<ref>Benge, Janet and Benge, Geoff (2005). ''Douglas MacArthur: what greater honor''. YWAM Publishing, p. 134. {{ISBN|1-932096-15-9}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 and 7 March, ''Phoenix'', ''Nashville'', and {{HMAS|Shropshire|1928|6}} bombarded Hauwei Island (just west of [[Los Negros Island]]) of the Admiralty Group. Enemy guns on this island had threatened [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] positions in the Admiralties, particularly on [[Manus Island]]; and, although return fire from the beach was heavy, enemy batteries ceased firing when shells from the cruisers burst in their vicinity.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nIn the [[Battle of Hollandia]], , the start of the [[Western New Guinea campaign]], [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] was next to fall to the mounting amphibious offensive. This largest assault till then undertaken by American forces, was launched by 200 ships. ''Phoenix'' shelled the shore in the [[Yos Sudarso Bay|Humboldt Bay]]-Hollandia area as the troops went ashore on 22 April, and supported them as they consolidated their gains and prepared for further attacks along the northwest coast of the big island. ''Phoenix'' shelled the [[Wakde Airfield|Wakde]] and [[Battle of Lone Tree Hill|Sawar Airfields]] on the night of 29\u201330 April to neutralize the danger of air attack on newly-won Allied positions on New Guinea.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur's troops next landed at Arare on 17 May to secure airfields to support further operations in the [[Netherlands New Guinea]] area. This beachhead was later extended to include [[Wakde Island]] by a shore to shore movement of troops. ''Phoenix'' bombarded the Toem area and escorted the troops to the landing beach.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nThe amphibious [Battle of Biak]] followed. There, MacArthur planned to establish a forward base for heavy bombers. With ''Nashville'' and {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}}, ''Phoenix'' sortied from Humboldt Bay on 25 May and two days later supported the landing. While the task force fired on shore installations, two of the escorting destroyers were hit by shells from shore batteries. ''Phoenix'' wiped out the gun emplacement with two salvos from her [[5\"/25 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}}/25 cal]] batteries.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nOn 4 June, off the northwest coast of New Guinea, eight Japanese [[Strike fighter|fighter bomber]]s attacked ''Phoenix'''s task force. Two confined their attention to ''Phoenix''. Although the ship's gunfire did not hit the planes, it diverted their bomb runs. Both planes dropped bombs, one of which burst in the water close to ''Phoenix'', killing one man and wounding four others with fragments. The ship also suffered some underwater leakage and damage to her propellers. The following night, aircraft again attacked ''Phoenix''. This time, low-flying [[torpedo bomber]]s struck as she proceeded through Yapen Strait, between Biak and [[Yapen]] islands, but her gunfire and evasive tactics prevented damage.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Phoenix'' and her task force frustrated an enemy attempt to reinforce their garrisons on the night of 8\u20139 June. When they contacted the American ships, the Japanese destroyers turned and fled at such high speed that only one US destroyer division was able to get within firing range. After a running fight of three hours at long range, ''Phoenix'' and her sisters broke off action.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nWith ''Boise'' and ten destroyers, ''Phoenix'' sortied from [[Seeadler Harbor]] in the Admiralties and bombarded shore defenses before American forces landed on [[Noemfoor Island]] on 2 July. After the battle, many dead Japanese and wrecked planes were found in the target area assigned to ''Phoenix''.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Boise'', ''Nashville'', ''Shropshire'', ''Phoenix'' and {{HMAS|Australia|1927|6}} joined for the occupation of [[Morotai]] in the [[Molucca Islands]] on 15 September. The cruisers shelled nearby [[Halmahera Island]] to cover the landing and protect the assault forces as they went ashore against continuing light opposition.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n====Philippines campaign====\nThe long-awaited re-conquest of the [[Philippines]] began with the landing on [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]]. ''Phoenix'', attached to the Close Covering Group, heavily bombarded the beaches before the highly successful landing on 20 October. Her batteries silenced an enemy strong point holding up the advance of a battalion of the [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry Regiment]] and continued to furnish effective callfire.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nIn the [[battle of Leyte Gulf]], ''Phoenix'' was a unit of Rear Admiral [[Jesse Oldendorf]]'s group which annihilated the Japanese Southern Force in the [[battle of Surigao Strait]]. ''Phoenix'' fired four spotting salvoes, and when the fourth hit, opened up with all of her 6-inch (152 mm) batteries. The target later proved to be {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}}, which sank after 27 minutes of concentrated fire from the American fleet. The Japanese also lost {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Fus\u014d||2}} and three destroyers in the battle, and American planes sank {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Mogami|1934|2}} the next day.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Phoenix'' then patrolled the mouth of [[Leyte Gulf]] to protect Allied positions on shore. On the morning of 1 November 1944, ten enemy torpedo-bombers attacked her and accompanying ships. At 0945, ''Phoenix'' opened fire and five minutes later, {{USS|Claxton|DD-571|2}} was hit by a ''[[kamikaze]]''. Almost at the same instant, hits from ''Phoenix''{{'}}s {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns set another plane afire but could not prevent it from diving into the starboard bow of {{USS|Ammen|DD-527|2}}. At 0957, a plane making a torpedo run on ''Phoenix'' was shot down by the ship's machine-gun fire, but in a few minutes a bomber hit {{USS|Killen|DD-593|2}}.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nAfter a lull of two and a half hours, more ''kamikazes'' arrived and, at 1340, scored a hit on the destroyer {{USS|Abner Read|DD-526|2}}. Japanese aircraft attacked the other destroyers as they stood by the sinking ship, but ''Phoenix'' shot down one of the raiders.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Phoenix'' was attacked again by enemy planes on 5 December and was credited with assisting in the destruction of two attackers. Five days later, a ''kamikaze'' attempted to crash into the ship but was brought down by 40&nbsp;mm fire when only {{convert|100|yd|m|-2|abbr=on}} away. It was at this time ''Phoenix'' suffered her only wartime fatality.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nWhile proceeding to the assault area off [[Mindoro]] on 13 December, the ship was constantly under air attack by single ''kamikazes''. That day, a lone ''kamikaze'' hit ''Nashville''. On 15 December, a 5-inch (127&nbsp;mm) shell from ''Phoenix'' brought down a circling plane at {{convert|8,500|yd|km}}. The ship then furnished her usual fire support and covered the landing forces. This gave the Allies a base from which to strike at Japan's shipping lanes through the [[South China Sea]] and to soften up [[Luzon]] for forthcoming landings.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\nEn route to [[Lingayen Gulf]] for the invasion of Luzon, lookouts on board ''Phoenix'' sighted the [[conning tower]] of a diving [[submarine]] in the [[Mindanao Sea]] off [[Siquijor]]. The submarine submerged and fired two torpedoes which ''Phoenix'' dodged. {{USS|Taylor|DD-468|2}} blew the midget sub to the surface and rammed her.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n====End of the war====\n''Phoenix'' covered minesweeping operations at [[Balikpapan]], [[Borneo]], from 29 June to 7 July. Resistance from coastal guns was unusually heavy. Mines and shellfire sank or damaged 11 [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]]. ''Phoenix'' furnished supporting fire and the assault waves landed. Next came [[Bataan]] and [[Corregidor]], taken from 13\u201328 February 1945.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n''Phoenix'' was en route to Pearl Harbor for overhaul when Japan capitulated. She headed home and, upon reaching the [[Panama Canal]] on 6 September, joined the [[United States Fleet Forces Command#World War II|Atlantic Fleet]]. Her status was reduced to in commission, in reserve, at Philadelphia on 28 February 1946.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships:''Phoenix''}}\n\n==Argentine service==\n[[File:US Navy 070502-N-4021H-082 USS Pearl Harbor (LSD 52) Commanding Officer, Cmdr.
