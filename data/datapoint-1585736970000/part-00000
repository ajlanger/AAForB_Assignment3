A variation on it as a method of cleansing and relaxation became popular during the [[Victorian era]], and then spread through the [[British Empire]] and [[Western Europe]]. The buildings are similar to Roman ''[[thermae]]''.  Unlike Russian saunas (''[[banya (sauna)|banya]]''), which use steam, Turkish baths focus on water.\n\nThe particular bathing process roughly parallels [[ancient Roman bathing]] practices. It starts with relaxation in a room heated by a continuous flow of hot, dry air, allowing the bather to perspire freely. Bathers may then move to an even hotter room before they wash in cold water. After performing a full body wash and receiving a [[massage]], bathers finally retire to the cooling-room for a period of relaxation.<ref>\"Hammam\" by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Jahan-i Tibb, Volume 7, Number 1, July\u2013September 2005, Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine, [[Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy]], pages 12\u201317.</ref>\n\nUnlike a hammam, Victorian Turkish baths use hot, dry air; in the Islamic hammam the air is often steamy. The bather in a Victorian Ottoman bath will often take a plunge in a cold pool after the hot rooms; the Islamic hammam usually does not have a pool unless the water is flowing from a spring. In the Islamic hammams, the bathers splash themselves with cold water.\n\nThe Victorian Turkish bath was described by [[Johann Ludwig Wilhelm Thudichum]]<ref>\"The Turkish bath\" by [[J L W Thudichum]], Transactions of the Royal Medical Society, 1861, page 40.</ref> in a lecture to the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] given in 1861, one year after the first such bath was opened in London:\n\n{{quote|The discovery that was lost and has been found again, is this, in the fewest possible words: The application of hot air to the human body.

It is customary before praying to perform [[Ritual purification|ablutions]]. The two Islamic forms of ablution are ''[[ghusl]]'', a full-body cleansing, and ''[[wudu]]'', a cleansing of the face, hands, and feet.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rahim|first=Habibeh|title=Understanding Islam|journal=The Furrow|year=2001|volume=52|issue=12|pages=670\u2013674}}</ref>  In the absence of water, cleansing with pure soil or sand is also permissible.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reinhart|first=Kevin|title=Impurity/No Danger|journal=History of Religions|year=1990|volume=30|issue=1|pages=1\u201324|doi=10.1086/463212}}</ref>  Mosques always provide a place to wash, but often hammams are located nearby for those who wish to perform deeper cleansing.<ref name=\"Sibley\">{{cite journal|last=Sibley|first=Magda|title=The Historic Hammams of Damascus and Fez: Lessons of Sustainability and Future Developments|journal=The 23rd Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture}}</ref>\n\nHammams, particularly in Morocco, evolved from their Roman roots to adapt to the needs of ritual purification according to Islam. For example, in most Roman-style hammams, one finds a cold pool for full submersion of the body. The style of bathing is less preferable in the Islamic faith, which finds bathing under running water without being fully submerged more appropriate.<ref name=\"Sibley\"/>\n\n[[Al-Ghazali]], a prominent Muslim theologian writing in the 11th century, wrote ''Revival of the Religious Sciences'', a multi-volume work on dissecting the proper forms of conduct for many aspects of Muslim life and death. One of the volumes, entitled ''The Mysteries of Purity'', details the proper technique for performing ablutions before prayer and great ablutions after physical activities deemed unclean, such as sex or defecation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Abu Hammid|title=The Mysteries of Purity: Being a Translation with Notes of the Kit\u0101b Asr\u0101r Al-\u1e6dah\u0101rah of Al-Ghazz\u0101li's I\u1e25y\u0101\u02bc \u02bbul\u016bm Al-d\u012bn|year=1975|publisher=Muhammad Ashraf|location=Lahore}}</ref> For al-Ghazali, the hammam is a primarily male experience, and he cautions that women are to enter the hammam only after childbirth or illness. Even then al-Gazali finds it admissible for men to prohibit their wives or sisters from using the hammam. The major point of contention surrounding hammams in al-Ghazali's estimation is nakedness. In his work he warns that overt nakedness is to be avoided. \"\u2026 he should shield it from the sight of others and second, guard against the touch of others.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Abu Hammid|title=The Mysteries of Purity: Being a Translation with Notes of the Kit\u0101b Asr\u0101r Al-\u1e6dah\u0101rah of Al-Ghazz\u0101li's I\u1e25y\u0101\u02bc \u02bbul\u016bm Al-d\u012bn|year=1975|publisher=Muhammad Ashraf|location=Lahore|page=51}}</ref>  He focuses extensively in his writing on the avoidance of touching the penis during bathing and after urination. He writes that nakedness is decent only when the area between the knees and the lower stomach of a man are hidden. For women, exposure of only the face and palms is appropriate. According to al-Gazali, the prevalence of nakedness in the hammam could incite indecent thoughts or behaviours and so it is a controversial space.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bouhdiba|first=Abdelwahab|title=Sexuality in Islam|year=1985|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|page=62}}</ref> Ritual ablution is also required before or after sexual intercourse.<ref name=\"Joseph 2003\">{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=Suad|title=Encyclopedia of Women & Islamic Cultures|year=2003|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|authorlink=Space: Hammam|author2=Afsaneh Najmabadi }}</ref> Knowing that, [[May Telmissany]], a professor at the University of Ottawa, argues that the image of a hyper-sexualised woman leaving the hammam is an [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] perspective that sees leaving or attending the hammam as a sign of pre-eminent sexual behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nkrumah|first=Gamal|title=Tales from the Hammam|newspaper=Al-Ahram Weekly|date=23 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumbnail|Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres: ''[[The Turkish Bath]]'', 1862 ([[Louvre]], Paris)]]\n\n== Social function: gendered social space ==\nArab hammams are gendered spaces where being a woman or a man can make someone included or a representative of the \"other\" respectively. Therefore, they represent a very special departure from the public sphere in which one is physically exposed amongst other women or men. This declaration of sexuality merely by being nude makes hammams a site of gendered expression. One exception to this gender segregation is the presence of young boys who often accompany their mothers until they grow old enough to necessitate attending the male hammam with their fathers.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Kilito| first=Abdelfettah|author2=Patricia Geesey |title=Architecture and the Sacred: A Season in the Hamam|journal=Research in African Literatures|year=1992|volume=23|issue=2|pages=203\u2013208}}</ref> The separation from the women\u2019s hammam and entrance to the male hammam usually occurs at the age of 5 or 6.<ref name=\"Joseph 2003\"/>\n\nAs a primarily female space, women's hammams play a special role in society. Valerie Staats finds that the women's hammams of Morocco serve as a social space where traditional and modern women from urban and rural areas of the country come together, regardless of their religiosity, to bathe and socialise.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Staats|first=Valerie|title=Ritual, Strategy, or Convention: Social Meanings in the Traditional Women's Baths in Morocco|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|year=1994|volume=14|issue=3|pages=1\u201318|doi=10.2307/3346678|jstor=3346678}}</ref> While al-Ghazali and other Islamic intellectuals may have stipulated certain regulations for bathing, the regulations, being outdated and fundamental, are not usually upheld in the everyday interactions of Moroccans in the hammam.

During those centuries of war, peace, alliance, trade and competition, the several cultures (Eastern Roman,  Islamic Persian and Turkic ) had tremendous influence on each other. Moving beyond the reuse of the Greek  and Roman baths (for example [[Byzantine Bath (Thessaloniki)]]), new bath were constructed as [[mosque#Ablution facilities|annex buildings of mosques]], the complexes of which were community centres as well as houses of worship.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] became prolific patrons of baths, building a number of ambitious structures, particularly in Constantinople, whose Greek inhabitants had retained a strong Eastern Roman bath culture (see [[Baths of Zeuxippus]]).<ref>[http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/Islahammam.htm Hamams in Islamic tradition (cyberbohemia.com)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814082956/http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/Islahammam.htm |date=14 August 2004 }}</ref> The monumental baths designed by Renaissance Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]] (1489\u20131588), such as the [[\u00c7emberlita\u015f Hamam\u0131]], the bath in the complex of the [[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]], and the bath of the [[Selimiye Mosque, Edirne|Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]] were particularly influential.\n\nLike its Roman predecessor, a typical hamam consists of three basic, interconnected rooms: the ''s\u0131cakl\u0131k'' (or ''hararet'' \u2013 in Latin, [[caldarium]]), which is the hot room; the warm room ([[tepidarium]]), which is the intermediate room; and the ''so\u011fukluk'', which is the cool room ([[frigidarium]]). The main evolutionary change between Roman baths and Turkish baths concerned the cool room. The Roman ''frigidarium'' included a quite cold water pool in which patrons would immerse themselves before moving on to the warmer rooms. Medieval Muslim customs put a high priority on cleanliness but preferred running water to immersion baths, so the cold water pool was dispensed with. Also, the sequence of rooms was revised so that people generally used the cool room after the warmer rooms and massages, rather than before. Whereas the Romans used it as preparation, the Ottomans used it for refreshment (drinks and snacks are served) and recovery.\n\nThe ''s\u0131cakl\u0131k'' usually has a large dome decorated with small glass [[clerestory]] windows that create a half-light; in the center of the room is a large heated marble table (''g\u00f6bek ta\u015f\u0131'' or navel stone) that the customers lie on, and niches with fountains in the corners. This room is for soaking up steam and getting scrub massages. The warm room is used for washing with soap and water and the ''so\u011fukluk'' is to relax, dress, have a refreshing drink, sometimes tea, and, where available, a nap in a private cubicle after the massage. A few of the hamams in [[Istanbul]] also contain ''[[mikveh]]''s, ritual cleansing baths for Jewish women.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nThe hamam, like its precursors, is not exclusive to men. Hamam complexes usually contain separate quarters for men and women; or males and females are admitted at separate times. Because they were social centers as well as baths, hamams became numerous during the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and were built in almost every Ottoman city. On many occasions they became places of entertainment (such as dancing and food, especially in the women's quarters) and ceremonies, such as before weddings, high-holidays, celebrating newborns, beauty trips.\n\nSeveral accessories from Roman times survive in modern hamams, such as the ''[[peshtamal|pe\u015ftemal]]'' (a special cloth of silk and/or cotton to cover the body, like a [[pareo]]), ''nal\u0131n'' (wooden [[clogs]] that prevent slipping on the wet floor, or mother-of-pearl), ''kese'' (a rough mitt for massage), and sometimes jewel boxes, gilded soap boxes, mirrors, [[henna]] bowls and perfume bottles. \n\nTraditionally, the masseurs in the baths, ''tellak'' in Turkish, were young men who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. After the defeat and dismemberment of the Ottoman army in the early 20th century, the role of tellak boys was filled by adult attendants.<ref>{{harv|Yilmazkaya|Deniz|2005}} discusses occasional licentious activity</ref>\n\n==Famous examples==\n[[File:\u0130stanbul - Ayasofya H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131 r2 - \u015eub 2013.JPG|thumb|The [[Haseki H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131]] ordered by [[Roxelana]] and constructed by [[Mimar Sinan]] in [[Istanbul]]]]\n\n===Arab world===\n==== Morocco ====\nThe ruins of the oldest known Islamic hammam in Morocco, dating back to the late 8th century, can be found in [[Volubilis]]. Public baths in Morocco are embedded into a social-cultural history that has played a significant role in both urban and rural Moroccan cities. These public spaces for cleansing grew rapidly as Islamic cultures assimilated to the bathing techniques widely used during the Roman and Byzantine periods.<ref name=\"Sibley\"/> The structure of Islamic hammams in the Arab world varies from that of what has been termed the traditional \u201c[[Roman bath]].\u201d Additionally, since Morocco (unlike Egypt or Syria) was never under Ottoman rule, its baths are not technically Turkish although guide books might refer to them as such. This misnomer can be due in part to the Arabic use of the word hammam, which translates to \u201cbathroom\u201d or \u201cpublic bath place\u201d and can be used to refer to all baths, including those in the Turkish and Roman design.\n\nHammams in Morocco are often close to mosques to facilitate the performance of ablutions. Because of their private nature (overt nudity and gender separation), their entrances are often discreet and the building's fa\u00e7ade is typically windowless. Vestiges of Roman bathing styles can be seen in the manifestation of the three-room structure, which was widespread during the Roman/Byzantine period.\n\nIn Morocco, hammams are typically smaller than Roman/Byzantine baths. While it may be difficult to identify a hammam from the face of the structure, the hammam roof betrays itself with its series of characteristic domes that indicate chambers in the building.<ref name=\"Sibley 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Sibley|first=Magda|author2=Fodil Fadli |title=Hammams in North Africa: An Architectural Study of Sustainability Concepts in a Historical Traditional Building|journal=26th Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture|year=2009}}</ref> Hammams often occupy irregularly shaped plots to fit them seamlessly into the city\u2019s design. They are significant sites of culture and socialisation as they are integrated into medina, or city, life in proximity to mosques, madrassas (schools) and aswaq (markets). Magda Sibley, an expert on Islamic public baths writes that second to mosques, many specialists in Islamic architecture and urbanism find the hammam to be the most significant building in Islamic medinas.<ref name=\"Sibley 2009\"/>\n\n====Syria====\nAn old legendary story says that [[Damascus]] once had 365 hammams or \"Turkish baths\", one for each day of the year. For centuries, hammams were an integral part of community life, with some 50 hammams surviving in Damascus until the 1950s. {{As of|2012}}, however, with the growth of modernisation programmes and home bathrooms, fewer than 20 Damascene working hamams had survived.<ref>[http://garnetpublishing.co.uk/book/hammaming-sham ''Hammaming in the Sham: A Journey through the Turkish Baths of Damascus, Aleppo and Beyond''], Richard Boggs, Garnet Publishing Ltd.</ref> According to many historians, the northern city of [[Aleppo]] was home to 177 hammams during the medieval period until the Mongol invasion when many vital structures in the city were destroyed.

Nowadays, roughly 18 hammams are operating in the [[Ancient City of Aleppo|Ancient part of the city]].<ref>[http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&category=round&filename=200808202135011 Alepo hammams]</ref>\n*[[Hammam al-Sultan]] built in 1211 by [[Az-Zahir Ghazi]].\n*[[Hammam al-Nahhaseen]] built during the 12th century near Khan al-Nahhaseen.\n*[[Hammam al-Bayadah]] of the Mamluk era built in 1450.\n*[[Hammam Yalbugha]] built in 1491 by the [[List of rulers of Aleppo|Emir of Aleppo]] Saif ad-Din Yalbugha al-Naseri.<ref>{{cite book |title=Syria & Lebanon |last1= Carter|first1= Terry|last2=Dunston |first2=Lara |last3= Humphreys|first3= Andrew|year=2004 |publisher=Lonely Planet |location= |isbn=978-1-86450-333-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781864503333/page/186 186] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781864503333 |url-access=registration |quote=Hammam yalbougha. |accessdate=}}</ref>\n*Hammam al-Jawhary, Gammam Azdemir, Hammam Bahram Pasha, Hammam Bab al-Ahmar, etc.\n\n====Egypt====\n[[Egypt]] was part of the Ottoman Empire, and the hamams of [[Cairo]] and other major cities like [[Alexandria]] are evidence of the unique Ottoman legacy. There used to be as many as 300 hamams in Cairo. {{As of|2012}}, only seven remain. Two of them, located in the El Hussien and [[Khan el-Khalili]] districts are closed.\n\n===Turkey===\nThere are many historical hammams in Istanbul. ''[[A\u011fa hamam\u0131]]'', built in 1454, is on Turnac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 Street near [[Taksim Square]]. The ''[[Haseki H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131]]'' or ''Ayasofya Haseki Hamam\u0131'' was commissioned by Suleiman I's consort, H\u00fcrrem Sultan, and constructed by Mimar Sinan during the 16th century. It was built on the site of the historical [[Baths of Zeuxippus]] for the religious community of the nearby [[Hagia Sophia]]. [[S\u00fcleymaniye Hamam]] is situated on a hill facing the [[Golden Horn]]. It was built in 1557 by Mimar Sinan; it was named after S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent. It is part of the complex of the [[Suleymaniye Mosque]]. ''[[\u00c7emberlita\u015f Hamam\u0131]]'' on Divanyolu Street in the \u00c7emberlita\u015f neighbourhood was constructed by Mimar Sinan in 1584. The Ca\u011falo\u011flu Hamam, finished in 1741, is the last hamam to be built in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOutside the capital, ''Tarihi Karata\u015f Ho\u015fg\u00f6r Hamam\u0131'', built in 1855, is on Karata\u015f in the [[Konak, Izmir|Konak]] neighbourhood of [[Izmir]]. \n\n===Greece and Cyprus===\n[[File:Nicosia 01-2017 img11 Omeriye Hammam.jpg|thumb|[[Hamam Omerye Baths]], Nicosia, Cyprus]]\n\n[[File: Pasha Hamam, Thessaloniki.JPG|thumb|Pasha Hamam, Thessaloniki, Greece]]\n\nIn [[Thessaloniki]], [[Bey Hamam]] was built in 1444 by sultan [[Murad II]]. It is a double bath, for men and women. The baths remained in use, under the name \"Baths of Paradise\", until 1968. Pasha Hamam was built in 1520\u20131530, during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], and operated until 1981 under the name \"Fenix Baths\". Restored, it now houses archeological findings from construction on the Thessaloniki metro. \n\nThe [[Hamam Omerye Baths]] in [[Nicosia]] date to the 14th century. Built as an [[Augustinian]] church of St. Mary of stone, with small domes, they date to the Frankish and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] period, like the city walls. In 1571, the ruler Mustafa Bilal Geldosh Pasha converted the church into a mosque, believing that it was where the Khalifa [[Umar]] rested during his visit to Lefkosia.

Turkish baths were introduced by [[David Urquhart]], diplomat and sometime [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Stafford]], who for political and personal reasons wished to popularise [[Turkish culture]]. In 1850, he wrote ''The Pillars of Hercules'', a book about his travels in 1848 through Spain and Morocco. He described the system of dry hot-air baths used there and in the [[Ottoman Empire]], which had changed little since [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]]. In 1856, [[Richard Barter]] read Urquhart's book and worked with him to construct a bath. Although this was not a success, Barter persevered and later that year opened the first modern Turkish bath at St Ann's Hydropathic Establishment near [[Blarney]], [[County Cork]], Ireland.<ref name=\"ShifrinStAnnsIreland\">{{Citation| last=Shifrin| first=Malcolm | title=St Ann's Hydropathic Establishment, Blarney, Co.

It reached London in July 1860, when Roger Evans, a member of one of Urquhart's Foreign Affairs Committees, opened a Turkish bath at 5 Bell Street, near [[Marble Arch]].\n\nDuring the following 150 years, over 600 Turkish baths opened in the country, including those built by municipal authorities as part of swimming pool complexes, taking advantage of the fact that water-heating boilers were already on site.\n\nSimilar baths opened in other parts of the British Empire. Dr. [[John Le Gay Brereton]], who had given medical advice to bathers in a Foreign Affairs Committee-owned Turkish bath in [[Bradford]], travelled to [[Sydney]], Australia, and opened a Turkish bath there on Spring Street in 1859, even before such baths had reached London.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shifrin|first=Malcolm|title=Victorian Turkish Baths|year=2015|publisher=Historic England|location=London|pages=51\u20132}}</ref>  Canada had one by 1869, and the first in New Zealand was opened in 1874.\n\nUrquhart's influence was also felt outside the Empire when in 1861, Dr Charles H Shepard opened the first Turkish baths in the United States at 63 Columbia Street, [[Brooklyn Heights]], New York City, most probably on 3 October 1863.<ref>''[[The Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]'', 3 October 1863</ref> Before that, the United States, like many other places, had several Russian baths, one of the first being that opened in 1861 by M.

A variation on it as a method of cleansing and relaxation became popular during the [[Victorian era]], and then spread through the [[British Empire]] and [[Western Europe]]. The buildings are similar to Roman ''[[thermae]]''.  Unlike Russian saunas (''[[banya (sauna)|banya]]''), which use steam, Turkish baths focus on water.\n\nThe particular bathing process roughly parallels [[ancient Roman bathing]] practices. It starts with relaxation in a room heated by a continuous flow of hot, dry air, allowing the bather to perspire freely. Bathers may then move to an even hotter room before they wash in cold water. After performing a full body wash and receiving a [[massage]], bathers finally retire to the cooling-room for a period of relaxation.<ref>\"Hammam\" by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Jahan-i Tibb, Volume 7, Number 1, July\u2013September 2005, Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine, [[Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy]], pages 12\u201317.</ref>\n\nUnlike a hammam, Victorian Turkish baths use hot, dry air; in the Islamic hammam the air is often steamy. The bather in a Victorian Ottoman bath will often take a plunge in a cold pool after the hot rooms; the Islamic hammam usually does not have a pool unless the water is flowing from a spring. In the Islamic hammams, the bathers splash themselves with cold water.\n\nThe Victorian Turkish bath was described by [[Johann Ludwig Wilhelm Thudichum]]<ref>\"The Turkish bath\" by [[J L W Thudichum]], Transactions of the Royal Medical Society, 1861, page 40.</ref> in a lecture to the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] given in 1861, one year after the first such bath was opened in London:\n\n{{quote|The discovery that was lost and has been found again, is this, in the fewest possible words: The application of hot air to the human body.

It is customary before praying to perform [[Ritual purification|ablutions]]. The two Islamic forms of ablution are ''[[ghusl]]'', a full-body cleansing, and ''[[wudu]]'', a cleansing of the face, hands, and feet.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rahim|first=Habibeh|title=Understanding Islam|journal=The Furrow|year=2001|volume=52|issue=12|pages=670\u2013674}}</ref>  In the absence of water, cleansing with pure soil or sand is also permissible.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reinhart|first=Kevin|title=Impurity/No Danger|journal=History of Religions|year=1990|volume=30|issue=1|pages=1\u201324|doi=10.1086/463212}}</ref>  Mosques always provide a place to wash, but often hammams are located nearby for those who wish to perform deeper cleansing.<ref name=\"Sibley\">{{cite journal|last=Sibley|first=Magda|title=The Historic Hammams of Damascus and Fez: Lessons of Sustainability and Future Developments|journal=The 23rd Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture}}</ref>\n\nHammams, particularly in Morocco, evolved from their Roman roots to adapt to the needs of ritual purification according to Islam. For example, in most Roman-style hammams, one finds a cold pool for full submersion of the body. The style of bathing is less preferable in the Islamic faith, which finds bathing under running water without being fully submerged more appropriate.<ref name=\"Sibley\"/>\n\n[[Al-Ghazali]], a prominent Muslim theologian writing in the 11th century, wrote ''Revival of the Religious Sciences'', a multi-volume work on dissecting the proper forms of conduct for many aspects of Muslim life and death. One of the volumes, entitled ''The Mysteries of Purity'', details the proper technique for performing ablutions before prayer and great ablutions after physical activities deemed unclean, such as sex or defecation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Abu Hammid|title=The Mysteries of Purity: Being a Translation with Notes of the Kit\u0101b Asr\u0101r Al-\u1e6dah\u0101rah of Al-Ghazz\u0101li's I\u1e25y\u0101\u02bc \u02bbul\u016bm Al-d\u012bn|year=1975|publisher=Muhammad Ashraf|location=Lahore}}</ref> For al-Ghazali, the hammam is a primarily male experience, and he cautions that women are to enter the hammam only after childbirth or illness. Even then al-Gazali finds it admissible for men to prohibit their wives or sisters from using the hammam. The major point of contention surrounding hammams in al-Ghazali's estimation is nakedness. In his work he warns that overt nakedness is to be avoided. \"\u2026 he should shield it from the sight of others and second, guard against the touch of others.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Abu Hammid|title=The Mysteries of Purity: Being a Translation with Notes of the Kit\u0101b Asr\u0101r Al-\u1e6dah\u0101rah of Al-Ghazz\u0101li's I\u1e25y\u0101\u02bc \u02bbul\u016bm Al-d\u012bn|year=1975|publisher=Muhammad Ashraf|location=Lahore|page=51}}</ref>  He focuses extensively in his writing on the avoidance of touching the penis during bathing and after urination. He writes that nakedness is decent only when the area between the knees and the lower stomach of a man are hidden. For women, exposure of only the face and palms is appropriate. According to al-Gazali, the prevalence of nakedness in the hammam could incite indecent thoughts or behaviours and so it is a controversial space.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bouhdiba|first=Abdelwahab|title=Sexuality in Islam|year=1985|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|page=62}}</ref> Ritual ablution is also required before or after sexual intercourse.<ref name=\"Joseph 2003\">{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=Suad|title=Encyclopedia of Women & Islamic Cultures|year=2003|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|authorlink=Space: Hammam|author2=Afsaneh Najmabadi }}</ref> Knowing that, [[May Telmissany]], a professor at the University of Ottawa, argues that the image of a hyper-sexualised woman leaving the hammam is an [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] perspective that sees leaving or attending the hammam as a sign of pre-eminent sexual behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nkrumah|first=Gamal|title=Tales from the Hammam|newspaper=Al-Ahram Weekly|date=23 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumbnail|Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres: ''[[The Turkish Bath]]'', 1862 ([[Louvre]], Paris)]]\n\n== Social function: gendered social space ==\nArab hammams are gendered spaces where being a woman or a man can make someone included or a representative of the \"other\" respectively. Therefore, they represent a very special departure from the public sphere in which one is physically exposed amongst other women or men. This declaration of sexuality merely by being nude makes hammams a site of gendered expression. One exception to this gender segregation is the presence of young boys who often accompany their mothers until they grow old enough to necessitate attending the male hammam with their fathers.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Kilito| first=Abdelfettah|author2=Patricia Geesey |title=Architecture and the Sacred: A Season in the Hamam|journal=Research in African Literatures|year=1992|volume=23|issue=2|pages=203\u2013208}}</ref> The separation from the women\u2019s hammam and entrance to the male hammam usually occurs at the age of 5 or 6.<ref name=\"Joseph 2003\"/>\n\nAs a primarily female space, women's hammams play a special role in society.

During those centuries of war, peace, alliance, trade and competition, the several cultures (Eastern Roman,  Islamic Persian and Turkic ) had tremendous influence on each other. Moving beyond the reuse of the Greek  and Roman baths (for example [[Byzantine Bath (Thessaloniki)]]), new bath were constructed as [[mosque#Ablution facilities|annex buildings of mosques]], the complexes of which were community centres as well as houses of worship.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] became prolific patrons of baths, building a number of ambitious structures, particularly in Constantinople, whose Greek inhabitants had retained a strong Eastern Roman bath culture (see [[Baths of Zeuxippus]]).<ref>[http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/Islahammam.htm Hamams in Islamic tradition (cyberbohemia.com)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814082956/http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/Islahammam.htm |date=14 August 2004 }}</ref> The monumental baths designed by Renaissance Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]] (1489\u20131588), such as the [[\u00c7emberlita\u015f Hamam\u0131]], the bath in the complex of the [[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]], and the bath of the [[Selimiye Mosque, Edirne|Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]] were particularly influential.\n\nLike its Roman predecessor, a typical hamam consists of three basic, interconnected rooms: the ''s\u0131cakl\u0131k'' (or ''hararet'' - in Latin, [[caldarium]]), which is the hot room; the warm room ([[tepidarium]]), which is the intermediate room; and the ''so\u011fukluk'', which is the cool room ([[frigidarium]]). The main evolutionary change between Roman baths and Turkish baths concerned the cool room. The Roman ''frigidarium'' included a quite cold water pool in which patrons would immerse themselves before moving on to the warmer rooms. Medieval Muslim customs put a high priority on cleanliness but preferred running water to immersion baths, so the cold water pool was dispensed with. Also, the sequence of rooms was revised so that people generally used the cool room after the warmer rooms and massages, rather than before. Whereas the Romans used it as preparation, the Ottomans used it for refreshment (drinks and snacks are served) and recovery.\n\nThe ''s\u0131cakl\u0131k'' usually has a large dome decorated with small glass [[clerestory]] windows that create a half-light; in the center of the room is a large heated marble table (''g\u00f6bek ta\u015f\u0131'' or navel stone) that the customers lie on, and niches with fountains in the corners. This room is for soaking up steam and getting scrub massages. The warm room is used for washing with soap and water and the ''so\u011fukluk'' is to relax, dress, have a refreshing drink, sometimes tea, and, where available, a nap in a private cubicle after the massage. A few of the hamams in [[Istanbul]] also contain ''[[mikveh]]''s, ritual cleansing baths for Jewish women.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nThe hamam, like its precursors, is not exclusive to men. Hamam complexes usually contain separate quarters for men and women; or males and females are admitted at separate times. Because they were social centers as well as baths, hamams became numerous during the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and were built in almost every Ottoman city. On many occasions they became places of entertainment (such as dancing and food, especially in the women's quarters) and ceremonies, such as before weddings, high-holidays, celebrating newborns, beauty trips.\n\nSeveral accessories from Roman times survive in modern hamams, such as the ''[[peshtamal|pe\u015ftemal]]'' (a special cloth of silk and/or cotton to cover the body, like a [[pareo]]), ''nal\u0131n'' (wooden [[clogs]] that prevent slipping on the wet floor, or mother-of-pearl), ''kese'' (a rough mitt for massage), and sometimes jewel boxes, gilded soap boxes, mirrors, [[henna]] bowls and perfume bottles. \n\nTraditionally, the masseurs in the baths, ''tellak'' in Turkish, were young men who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. After the defeat and dismemberment of the Ottoman army in the early 20th century, the role of tellak boys was filled by adult attendants.<ref>{{harv|Yilmazkaya|Deniz|2005}} discusses occasional licentious activity</ref>\n\n==Famous examples==\n[[File:\u0130stanbul - Ayasofya H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131 r2 - \u015eub 2013.JPG|thumb|The [[Haseki H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131]] ordered by [[Roxelana]] and constructed by [[Mimar Sinan]] in [[Istanbul]]]]\n\n===Arab world===\n==== Morocco ====\nThe ruins of the oldest known Islamic hammam in Morocco, dating back to the late 8th century, can be found in [[Volubilis]]. Public baths in Morocco are embedded into a social-cultural history that has played a significant role in both urban and rural Moroccan cities. These public spaces for cleansing grew rapidly as Islamic cultures assimilated to the bathing techniques widely used during the Roman and Byzantine periods.<ref name=\"Sibley\"/> The structure of Islamic hammams in the Arab world varies from that of what has been termed the traditional \u201c[[Roman bath]].\u201d Additionally, since Morocco (unlike Egypt or Syria) was never under Ottoman rule, its baths are not technically Turkish although guide books might refer to them as such. This misnomer can be due in part to the Arabic use of the word hammam, which translates to \u201cbathroom\u201d or \u201cpublic bath place\u201d and can be used to refer to all baths, including those in the Turkish and Roman design.\n\nHammams in Morocco are often close to mosques to facilitate the performance of ablutions. Because of their private nature (overt nudity and gender separation), their entrances are often discreet and the building's fa\u00e7ade is typically windowless. Vestiges of Roman bathing styles can be seen in the manifestation of the three-room structure, which was widespread during the Roman/Byzantine period.\n\nIn Morocco, hammams are typically smaller than Roman/Byzantine baths. While it may be difficult to identify a hammam from the face of the structure, the hammam roof betrays itself with its series of characteristic domes that indicate chambers in the building.<ref name=\"Sibley 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Sibley|first=Magda|author2=Fodil Fadli |title=Hammams in North Africa: An Architectural Study of Sustainability Concepts in a Historical Traditional Building|journal=26th Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture|year=2009}}</ref> Hammams often occupy irregularly shaped plots to fit them seamlessly into the city\u2019s design. They are significant sites of culture and socialisation as they are integrated into medina, or city, life in proximity to mosques, madrassas (schools) and aswaq (markets). Magda Sibley, an expert on Islamic public baths writes that second to mosques, many specialists in Islamic architecture and urbanism find the hammam to be the most significant building in Islamic medinas.<ref name=\"Sibley 2009\"/>\n\n====Syria====\nAn old legendary story says that [[Damascus]] once had 365 hammams or \"Turkish baths\", one for each day of the year. For centuries, hammams were an integral part of community life, with some 50 hammams surviving in Damascus until the 1950s. {{As of|2012}}, however, with the growth of modernisation programmes and home bathrooms, fewer than 20 Damascene working hamams had survived.<ref>[http://garnetpublishing.co.uk/book/hammaming-sham ''Hammaming in the Sham: A Journey through the Turkish Baths of Damascus, Aleppo and Beyond''], Richard Boggs, Garnet Publishing Ltd.</ref> According to many historians, the northern city of [[Aleppo]] was home to 177 hammams during the medieval period until the Mongol invasion when many vital structures in the city were destroyed. Until 1970, around 40 hammams were still operating in the city. Nowadays, roughly 18 hammams are operating in the [[Ancient City of Aleppo|Ancient part of the city]].<ref>[http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&category=round&filename=200808202135011 Alepo hammams]</ref>\n*[[Hammam al-Sultan]] built in 1211 by [[Az-Zahir Ghazi]].\n*[[Hammam al-Nahhaseen]] built during the 12th century near Khan al-Nahhaseen.\n*[[Hammam al-Bayadah]] of the Mamluk era built in 1450.\n*[[Hammam Yalbugha]] built in 1491 by the [[List of rulers of Aleppo|Emir of Aleppo]] Saif ad-Din Yalbugha al-Naseri.<ref>{{cite book |title=Syria & Lebanon |last1= Carter|first1= Terry|last2=Dunston |first2=Lara |last3= Humphreys|first3= Andrew|year=2004 |publisher=Lonely Planet |location= |isbn=978-1-86450-333-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781864503333/page/186 186] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781864503333 |url-access=registration |quote=Hammam yalbougha. |accessdate=}}</ref>\n*Hammam al-Jawhary, Gammam Azdemir, Hammam Bahram Pasha, Hammam Bab al-Ahmar, etc.\n\n====Egypt====\n[[Egypt]] was part of the Ottoman Empire, and the hamams of [[Cairo]] and other major cities like [[Alexandria]] are evidence of the unique Ottoman legacy. There used to be as many as 300 hamams in Cairo. {{As of|2012}}, only seven remain. Two of them, located in the El Hussien and [[Khan el-Khalili]] districts are closed.\n\n===Turkey===\nThere are many historical hammams in Istanbul. ''[[A\u011fa hamam\u0131]]'', built in 1454, is on Turnac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 Street near [[Taksim Square]]. The ''[[Haseki H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131]]'' or ''Ayasofya Haseki Hamam\u0131'' was commissioned by Suleiman I's consort, H\u00fcrrem Sultan, and constructed by Mimar Sinan during the 16th century. It was built on the site of the historical [[Baths of Zeuxippus]] for the religious community of the nearby [[Hagia Sophia]]. [[S\u00fcleymaniye Hamam]] is situated on a hill facing the [[Golden Horn]]. It was built in 1557 by Mimar Sinan; it was named after S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent. It is part of the complex of the [[Suleymaniye Mosque]]. ''[[\u00c7emberlita\u015f Hamam\u0131]]'' on Divanyolu Street in the \u00c7emberlita\u015f neighbourhood was constructed by Mimar Sinan in 1584. The Ca\u011falo\u011flu Hamam, finished in 1741, is the last hamam to be built in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOutside the capital, ''Tarihi Karata\u015f Ho\u015fg\u00f6r Hamam\u0131'', built in 1855, is on Karata\u015f in the [[Konak, Izmir|Konak]] neighbourhood of [[Izmir]]. \n\n===Greece and Cyprus===\n[[File:Nicosia 01-2017 img11 Omeriye Hammam.jpg|thumb|[[Hamam Omerye Baths]], Nicosia, Cyprus]]\n\n[[File: Pasha Hamam, Thessaloniki.JPG|thumb|Pasha Hamam, Thessaloniki, Greece]]\n\nIn [[Thessaloniki]], [[Bey Hamam]] was built in 1444 by sultan [[Murad II]]. It is a double bath, for men and women. The baths remained in use, under the name \"Baths of Paradise\", until 1968. Pasha Hamam was built in 1520-1530, during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], and operated until 1981 under the name \"Fenix Baths\". Restored, it now houses archeological findings from construction on the Thessaloniki metro. \n\nThe [[Hamam Omerye Baths]] in [[Nicosia]] date to the 14th century. Built as an [[Augustinian]] church of St. Mary of stone, with small domes, they date to the Frankish and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] period, like the city walls. In 1571, the ruler Mustafa Bilal Geldosh Pasha converted the church into a mosque, believing that it was where the Khalifa [[Umar]] rested during his visit to Lefkosia. Most of the building was destroyed by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] artillery although the door of the main entrance belongs to the 14th century Lusignan building, and remains of a later [[Renaissance]] phase can be seen at the north-eastern side of the monument. In 2003, the [EU] funded a bi-communal UNDP/UNOPS project, \"Partnership for the Future\", in collaboration with Nicosia Municipality and Nicosia Master Plan. The [[B\u00fcy\u00fck Hammam]] dates to the 14th century.\n\n[[Image:Torok furdo Budapest Ganz utca PB010341-lev-1000.jpg|thumb|Kir\u00e1ly Baths building on Ganz Street, Budapest]]\n\n===Hungary===\n[[Budapest]], the [[Spas in Budapest|City of Spas]] has four working Turkish baths, all from the 16th century and open to the public: [[Rudas Baths]], [[Kir\u00e1ly Baths]], [[R\u00e1cz Thermal Bath]], and Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r Spa Bath (reopened to the public since December 2012).\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Hammam Al-Nahhasseen Aleppo.jpg|[[Hammam al-Nahhasin]] in [[Aleppo]], 12th&nbsp;century\nFile:Aleppo Citadel 16 - Hammam.jpg|Hammam at the [[Citadel of Aleppo]], {{circa|1200}}\nFile:THES-Bey Hamam hot chamber 3.jpg|Hamam hot chamber in the [[Bey Hamam]] in [[Thessaloniki]], built 1444\nFile:Banys arabs3.jpg|Room at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ba\u00f1os del Almirante|es|3=Ba\u00f1os del Almirante}} in [[Valencia]], {{circa|1320}}\nFile:Hurrem Sultan Hamam Interior .png|''[[Haseki H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131]]'', 16th&nbsp;century\nFile:SamannudHammamSpring.jpg|Fountain in the Ibrahim Sirag el-Din hammam, [[Sebennytos|Samann\u016bd]], Egypt\nFile:Turkish Bath, interior 07 dome.JPG|Turkish Bath, interior\nFile:Divan Asia Istanbul Hamam 1140041.jpg|Istanbul, a hotel hamam\n</gallery>\n\n===India===\n[[Delhi]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Bhopal]] have multiple working Turkish Baths, which were started during the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] period in the early 16th century.<ref name=\"siasat\">{{cite news| title=Turkish bath centre defunct at Nizamia general hospital| url=http://www.siasat.com/english/news/turkish-bath-centre-defunct-nizamia-general-hospital| publisher=siasat.com| date=11 January 2012| accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Where are those Turkish baths?| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-06-11/delhi/27164199_1_intach-haveli-indian-national-trust| newspaper=The Times of India| date=11 June 2004| accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Centre keen on hammam| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-27/bhopal/30446875_1_steam-chamber-bath| newspaper=The Times of India| date=27 November 2011| accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Hyderabad Attractions| url=http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/india/hyderabad/33213/golconda-fort/attraction-detail.html| newspaper=The New York Times| date=12 January 2012| accessdate=12 January 2012| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120043953/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/india/hyderabad/33213/golconda-fort/attraction-detail.html| archivedate=20 November 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Syed Zillur Rahman, Hammam \u2013 Past and Present, Newsletter of Ibn Sina Academy 2012, Volume 12 No 1: 10-16</ref> Two prominent examples include the [[Hammam-e-Qadimi]] and [[Hammam (Red Fort)|Hammam-e-Lal Qila]].<ref name=\"Gianani2016\">{{cite web|url=http://www.natgeotraveller.in/bhopals-300-year-old-hidden-hammam/|title=Bhopal's 300-Year-Old Hidden Hammam|last=Gianani|first=Kareena|date=22 June 2016|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|language=English|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Pakistan===\n[[Lahore]]'s [[Shahi Hammam]] or Royal Bath House, located in the [[Walled City of Lahore]], is one of the best preserved examples of a [[Mughal era]] Hamam.

Turkish baths were introduced by [[David Urquhart]], diplomat and sometime [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Stafford]], who for political and personal reasons wished to popularise [[Turkish culture]]. In 1850, he wrote ''The Pillars of Hercules'', a book about his travels in 1848 through Spain and Morocco. He described the system of dry hot-air baths used there and in the [[Ottoman Empire]], which had changed little since [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]]. In 1856, [[Richard Barter]] read Urquhart's book and worked with him to construct a bath. Although this was not a success, Barter persevered and later that year opened the first modern Turkish bath at St Ann's Hydropathic Establishment near [[Blarney]], [[County Cork]], Ireland.<ref name=\"ShifrinStAnnsIreland\">{{Citation| last=Shifrin| first=Malcolm | title=St Ann's Hydropathic Establishment, Blarney, Co.

It reached London in July 1860, when Roger Evans, a member of one of Urquhart's Foreign Affairs Committees, opened a Turkish bath at 5 Bell Street, near [[Marble Arch]].\n\nDuring the following 150 years, over 600 Turkish baths opened in the country, including those built by municipal authorities as part of swimming pool complexes, taking advantage of the fact that water-heating boilers were already on site.\n\nSimilar baths opened in other parts of the British Empire. Dr. [[John Le Gay Brereton]], who had given medical advice to bathers in a Foreign Affairs Committee-owned Turkish bath in [[Bradford]], travelled to [[Sydney]], Australia, and opened a Turkish bath there on Spring Street in 1859, even before such baths had reached London.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shifrin|first=Malcolm|title=Victorian Turkish Baths|year=2015|publisher=Historic England|location=London|pages=51\u20132}}</ref>  Canada had one by 1869, and the first in New Zealand was opened in 1874.\n\nUrquhart's influence was also felt outside the Empire when in 1861, Dr Charles H Shepard opened the first Turkish baths in the United States at 63 Columbia Street, [[Brooklyn Heights]], New York City, most probably on 3 October 1863.<ref>''[[The Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]'', 3 October 1863</ref> Before that, the United States, like many other places, had several Russian baths, one of the first being that opened in 1861 by M.
