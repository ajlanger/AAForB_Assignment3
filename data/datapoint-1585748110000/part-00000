The park preserves about half of [[Mount Desert Island]], many adjacent smaller islands, and part of the [[Schoodic Peninsula]] on the coast of Maine. Acadia was initially designated [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Sieur de Monts]] [[National monument (United States)|National Monument]] by proclamation of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916. Sieur de Monts was renamed and redesignated [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] National Park by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1919\u2014the first national park in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]] and the only one in the [[Northeastern United States]]. The park was renamed [[Acadia]] National Park in 1929. More than 3.5 million people visited the park in 2018.\n\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] nations have inhabited the area called Acadia for at least 12,000 years. They [[Fur trade|traded furs]] for European goods when French, English, and Dutch ships began arriving in the early 17th century. The [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] has held an annual Native American Festival in Bar Harbor since 1989. [[Samuel de Champlain]] named the island Isle des Monts Deserts (Island of Barren Mountains) in 1604. The island was granted to [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1688, then ceded to England in 1713. Summer visitors, nicknamed ''rusticators'', arrived in 1855, followed by wealthy families, nicknamed ''cottagers'' as their large houses were quaintly called [[cottage]]s. [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] is credited with the idea for the park. [[George Dorr|George B. Dorr]], the \"Father of Acadia National Park,\" along with Eliot's father [[Charles William Eliot|Charles W. Eliot]], supported the idea through donations of land, and advocacy at the state and federal levels. [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] financed the construction of carriage roads from 1915 to 1940. A wildfire in 1947 burned much of the park and destroyed 237 houses, including 67 of the millionaires\u2019 cottages.\n\nThe park includes mountains, an ocean coastline, coniferous and deciduous woodlands, lakes, ponds, and wetlands encompassing a total of {{convert|49,075|acre|sqmi km2|1}} {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. Key sites on Mount Desert Island include [[Cadillac Mountain]]\u2014the tallest mountain on the eastern coastline and one of the first places in the United States where one can watch the sunrise\u2014a rocky coast featuring Thunder Hole where waves crash loudly into a crevasse around high tides, a sandy swimming beach called Sand Beach, and numerous lakes and ponds. [[Jordan Pond]] features the glacially rounded North and South Bubbles ([[r\u00f4che moutonn\u00e9e]]s) at its northern end, while Echo Lake has the only freshwater swimming beach in the park. [[Somes Sound]] is a {{convert|5|mi|km|0|adj=on|spell=in}} long [[fjard]] formed during a [[glacial period]] that reshaped the entire island to its present form, including the [[U-shaped valley]]s containing the many ponds and lakes. The [[Bass Harbor Head Light]] is situated above a steep, rocky headland on the southwest coast\u2014the only lighthouse on the island.\n\nThe park protects the habitats of 37 [[mammal]]ian species including [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[eastern moose|moose]] and [[white-tailed deer]], seven [[reptile|reptilian]] species including [[milk snake]]s and [[common snapping turtle|snapping turtles]], eleven [[amphibian]] species including [[wood frog]]s and [[spotted salamander]]s, 33 [[fish]] species including [[rainbow smelt]] and [[brook trout]], and as many as 331 [[bird]]s including various species of [[Bird of prey|raptors]], [[songbird]]s and [[Anseriformes|waterfowl]]. In 1991, [[peregrine falcon]]s had a successful nesting in Acadia for the first time since 1956. Falcon chicks are often banded to study migration, habitat use, and longevity. Some trails may be closed in spring and early summer to avoid disturbance to falcon nesting areas.\n\nRecreational activities from spring through autumn include car and bus touring along the park's paved loop road; hiking, bicycling, and horseback riding on carriage roads (motor vehicles are prohibited); rock climbing; kayaking and canoeing on lakes and ponds; swimming at Sand Beach and Echo Lake; sea kayaking and guided boat tours on the ocean; and various ranger-led programs. Winter activities include cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and ice fishing. Two campgrounds are located on Mount Desert Island, another campground is on the Schoodic Peninsula, and five [[lean-to]] sites are on Isle au Haut. The main visitor center is at Hulls Cove, northwest of Bar Harbor.\n\n==History==\n[[File:PenobscotBarkWigwamIn AcadiaPark.JPG|thumb|Replica of a [[Penobscot]] [[birch bark]] [[wigwam]]]]\n\n=== Native people ===\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have inhabited the area called [[Acadia]] for at least 12,000 years, including the coastal areas of Maine, Canada, and adjacent islands.

[[Castine, Maine|Castine]] (''Pentagoet'' in the native language) was the grandchief's favored rendezvous site for the Wabanaki tribes. The site is located just west of Mount Desert Island at the mouth of the [[Bagaduce River]] in eastern [[Penobscot Bay]]. From 1615, Castine developed into a major [[Fur trade|fur trading]] post where French, English, and Dutch traders all fought for control. [[Sealskin]]s, [[moose]] [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and furs were traded by the Wabanakis for European commodities. By the early 1620s, warfare and introduced diseases, including [[smallpox]], [[cholera]] and [[influenza]], had decimated the tribes from Mount Desert Island southward to [[Cape Cod]], leaving about 10 percent of the original population.<ref name=Prins>Prins, Harald E.

The colony was destroyed a short time later by an armed vessel from the [[Colony of Virginia]] as the first act of overt warfare in the long struggle leading to the [[French and Indian Wars]]. The island was granted to [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1688, but ceded to England in 1713. [[Massachusetts]] governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet]] assumed control of the island in 1760. In 1790, Massachusetts granted the eastern half of the island to Cadillac's granddaughter, Mme. de Gregoire, while Bernard's son John retained ownership of the western half. The first record of summer visitors vacationing on the island was in 1855, and steamboat service from [[Boston]] was inaugurated in 1868. The [[Green Mountain Cog Railway]] was built from the shore of Eagle Lake to the summit of [[Cadillac Mountain]] in 1888. In 1901, the Maine Legislature granted Hancock County a charter to acquire and hold land on the island in the public interest.

Painters came from the [[Hudson River School]], including [[Thomas Cole]] and [[Frederic Edwin Church|Frederic Church]], inspiring patrons and friends to visit. The term ''rusticator'' was used to describe these early visitors who stayed in the homes of local fishermen and farmers for modest fees. Every summer the rusticators returned to renew friendships with local islanders and to enjoy the fresh salt air and relaxed pace. The accommodations soon became insufficient for the increasing amount of summer visitors, and by 1880, thirty hotels were operating on the island.

Rivers and streams flowed again through the watershed, continuing the gradual erosion of the drainage paths.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\n===Erosion and weathering===\n[[File:A080, Acadia National Park, Maine, USA, Otter Cove, 2002.jpg|thumb|Otter Cove from Otter Point]]\nAcadia has a coastline composed of rocky [[headland]]s, and more heavily eroded stony or sandy beaches. Coastal areas directly facing the [[Wind wave|wind-driven waves]] of the Atlantic Ocean are solely composed of large boulders as all other material has been washed out to sea. Areas partially protected by rocky headlands contain the remains of more eroded rocks, consisting of pebbles, [[Cobble (geology)|cobbles]] and smaller boulders. Sheltered coves, such as at Sand Beach, contain fine-grained particles that are primarily the remains of shells and other hard parts of marine life, including [[mussel]]s and [[sea urchin]]s.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\nGranitic ridges are subjected to [[frost weathering]]. Joints, or fractures, are slowly enlarged as trapped water repeatedly freezes and melts, eventually splitting off a block. Bright pink scars with granitic rubble below are evidence of such weathering; one example can be seen above the [[Tarn (lake)|Tarn]], a pond just south of Bar Harbor.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\nAt least twelve sea caves are located in several coastal areas of the park. Sea caves are formed when waves cause erosion of coastal rock formations. If a sea cave is enlarged enough, it may break through a [[headland]] to form a [[Natural arch#Coastline|sea arch]].<ref name=geodiversity>{{NPS|source=[https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-geodiversity-atlas-acadia-national-park-maine.htm \"NPS Geodiversity Atlas\u2014Acadia National Park, Maine\"] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20181213101622/https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-geodiversity-atlas-acadia-national-park-maine.htm archive]).

Ice storms are common in winter and early spring, while rain occurs throughout the year. Saturated soils, thawing, and heavy precipitation lead to [[rockfall]]s every spring along Mount Desert Island's loop road, as well as [[Slump (geology)|slumping]] along coastal bluffs.<ref name=geodiversity/>\n\n[[Mass wasting]] (slope movement) of [[marine clay]], deposited when the sea level was much higher, occurs along Hunters Brook on Mount Desert Island.

The park preserves about half of [[Mount Desert Island]], many adjacent smaller islands, and part of the [[Schoodic Peninsula]] on the coast of Maine. Acadia was initially designated [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Sieur de Monts]] [[National monument (United States)|National Monument]] by proclamation of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916. Sieur de Monts was renamed and redesignated [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] National Park by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1919\u2014the first national park in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]] and the only one in the [[Northeastern United States]]. The park was renamed [[Acadia]] National Park in 1929. More than 3.5 million people visited the park in 2018.\n\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] nations have inhabited the area called Acadia for at least 12,000 years. They [[Fur trade|traded furs]] for European goods when French, English, and Dutch ships began arriving in the early 17th century. The [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] has held an annual Native American Festival in Bar Harbor since 1989. [[Samuel de Champlain]] named the island Isle des Monts Deserts (Island of Barren Mountains) in 1604. The island was granted to [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1688, then ceded to England in 1713. Summer visitors, nicknamed ''rusticators'', arrived in 1855, followed by wealthy families, nicknamed ''cottagers'' as their large houses were quaintly called [[cottage]]s. [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] is credited with the idea for the park. [[George Dorr|George B. Dorr]], the \"Father of Acadia National Park,\" along with Eliot's father [[Charles William Eliot|Charles W. Eliot]], supported the idea through donations of land, and advocacy at the state and federal levels. [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] financed the construction of carriage roads from 1915 to 1940. A wildfire in 1947 burned much of the park and destroyed 237 houses, including 67 of the millionaires\u2019 cottages.\n\nThe park includes mountains, an ocean coastline, coniferous and deciduous woodlands, lakes, ponds, and wetlands encompassing a total of {{convert|49,075|acre|sqmi km2|1}} {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. Key sites on Mount Desert Island include [[Cadillac Mountain]]\u2014the tallest mountain on the eastern coastline and one of the first places in the United States where one can watch the sunrise\u2014a rocky coast featuring Thunder Hole where waves crash loudly into a crevasse around high tides, a sandy swimming beach called Sand Beach, and numerous lakes and ponds. [[Jordan Pond]] features the glacially rounded North and South Bubbles ([[r\u00f4che moutonn\u00e9e]]s) at its northern end, while Echo Lake has the only freshwater swimming beach in the park. [[Somes Sound]] is a {{convert|5|mi|km|0|adj=on|spell=in}} long [[fjard]] formed during a [[glacial period]] that reshaped the entire island to its present form, including the [[U-shaped valley]]s containing the many ponds and lakes.

In 1991, [[peregrine falcon]]s had a successful nesting in Acadia for the first time since 1956. Falcon chicks are often banded to study migration, habitat use, and longevity. Some trails may be closed in spring and early summer to avoid disturbance to falcon nesting areas.\n\nRecreational activities from spring through autumn include car and bus touring along the park's paved loop road; hiking, bicycling, and horseback riding on carriage roads (motor vehicles are prohibited); rock climbing; kayaking and canoeing on lakes and ponds; swimming at Sand Beach and Echo Lake; sea kayaking and guided boat tours on the ocean; and various ranger-led programs. Winter activities include cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and ice fishing. Two campgrounds are located on Mount Desert Island, another campground is on the Schoodic Peninsula, and five [[lean-to]] sites are on Isle au Haut. The main visitor center is at Hulls Cove, northwest of Bar Harbor.\n\n==History==\n[[File:PenobscotBarkWigwamIn AcadiaPark.JPG|thumb|Replica of a [[Penobscot]] [[birch bark]] [[wigwam]]]]\n\n=== Native people ===\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have inhabited the area called [[Acadia]] for at least 12,000 years, including the coastal areas of Maine, Canada, and adjacent islands.

[[Castine, Maine|Castine]] (''Pentagoet'' in the native language) was the grandchief's favored rendezvous site for the Wabanaki tribes. The site is located just west of Mount Desert Island at the mouth of the [[Bagaduce River]] in eastern [[Penobscot Bay]]. From 1615, Castine developed into a major [[Fur trade|fur trading]] post where French, English, and Dutch traders all fought for control. [[Sealskin]]s, [[moose]] [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and furs were traded by the Wabanakis for European commodities. By the early 1620s, warfare and introduced diseases, including [[smallpox]], [[cholera]] and [[influenza]], had decimated the tribes from Mount Desert Island southward to [[Cape Cod]], leaving about 10 percent of the original population.<ref name=Prins>Prins, Harald E.

The colony was destroyed a short time later by an armed vessel from the [[Colony of Virginia]] as the first act of overt warfare in the long struggle leading to the [[French and Indian Wars]]. The island was granted to [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1688, but ceded to England in 1713. [[Massachusetts]] governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet]] assumed control of the island in 1760. In 1790, Massachusetts granted the eastern half of the island to Cadillac's granddaughter, Mme. de Gregoire, while Bernard's son John retained ownership of the western half. The first record of summer visitors vacationing on the island was in 1855, and steamboat service from [[Boston]] was inaugurated in 1868. The [[Green Mountain Cog Railway]] was built from the shore of Eagle Lake to the summit of [[Cadillac Mountain]] in 1888. In 1901, the Maine Legislature granted Hancock County a charter to acquire and hold land on the island in the public interest.

These families had elegant estates constructed, which they called [[cottage]]s.

The collision buried the schist along with accumulations of sand and [[silt]], creating the Bar Harbor Formation which consists of brown and gray [[sandstone]] and [[siltstone]] layers. Material from volcanic flows and ash were also deposited on the formation, creating the volcanic rock found on the Cranberry Islands. Further volcanic activity introduced [[Igneous rock|igneous]] rocks into the Bar Harbor Formation.

The granite body rose slowly through bedrock, fracturing it into large pieces, some of which melted under intense heat. As the granite cooled, the bedrock fragments were left surrounded by crystallized granite in a shatter zone that is visible on the eastern side of the mountain.
