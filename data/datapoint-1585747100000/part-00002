The [[United States Presidential Memorial|presidential memorial]] includes the four blocks surrounding the home and a [[visitor center]].\n\n==Historic site==\nIn 1837, Lincoln moved to Springfield from [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem]] at the start of his law career.  He met his wife, [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], at her sister's home in Springfield and married there in 1842.\n\nThe historic-site house at 413 South Eighth Street at the corner of Jackson Street, bought by Lincoln and his wife in 1844, was the only home that Lincoln ever owned. Three of their children were born there and one, [[Edward Baker Lincoln|Eddie]], died there.  The house contains twelve rooms spread over two floors. During the time he lived here, Lincoln was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1846, and elected President in 1860.\n\nLincoln's son, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] donated the family home to the State of Illinois in 1887 under the condition that it would forever be well maintained and open to the public at no charge. This came as a result of tenants who would charge those who wanted to visit Lincoln's home and that many tenants tended to leave the home in disrepair.   The home and [[Lincoln Tomb]], also in Springfield, were designated [[National Historic Landmark]]s on December 19, 1960, and automatically listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.
