{"title_page": "List of human spaceflight programs", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{For|a chronological list of human spaceflights, including crews, dates and mission summaries|List of human spaceflights}}\n\nThis is a '''list of human spaceflight programs''', including successful programs, programs that were canceled, and programs planned for the future. The criteria for what constitutes [[human spaceflight]] vary. The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|FAI]] defines spaceflight as any flight over {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}}. In the United States, professional, military, and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} are awarded [[astronaut wings]]. This article follows the FAI definition of spaceflight.\n\nUntil the 21st century, human spaceflight programs were sponsored exclusively by governments, through either the military or civilian space agencies. With the launch of the privately funded [[SpaceShipOne]] in 2004, a new category of human spaceflight programs \u2013 [[commercial astronaut|commercial human spaceflight]] \u2013 arrived.\n\n==Successful programs==\nPrograms in this section are sorted by the years when the first successful crewed spaceflight took place.\n\n===Vostok program (USSR, 1956\u20131964)===\n[[Image:Vostok spacecraft.jpg|thumb|300px|Model of Vostok spacecraft with third stage of launcher]]\nThe [[Vostok program]] was a project that succeeded in putting a person into orbit for the first time. Sergei Korolev and Konstantin Feoktistov began, in June 1956, crewed spacecraft research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/4/404page.html|title=Encyclopedia Astronautica Index: 1|website=www.astronautix.com}}</ref> The program developed the [[Vostok spacecraft]] from the [[Zenit spy satellite]] project and adapted the [[Vostok rocket]] from an existing [[ICBM]] design. Just before the first release of the name Vostok to the press, it was a classified word. By August/September 1958 a division had been formed devoted to producing the first Vostok craft. The official approval (decree) for the Vostok was delayed until 22 May 1959 by competition with photo reconnaissance programs.\n\nVostok 1 was the first [[human spaceflight]]. The [[Vostok 3KA]] spacecraft was launched on April 12, 1961, taking  into space [[Yuri Gagarin]], a [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] from the [[Soviet Union]]. The Vostok 1 mission was the first time anyone had journeyed into [[outer space]] and the first time anyone had entered into [[Orbit (celestial mechanics)|orbit]].\n\nThere were six Vostok flights in total. Another seven Vostok flights (Vostok 7 to 13) were originally planned, going through to April 1966, but these were canceled and the components recycled into the [[Voskhod program]], which was intended to achieve more Soviet firsts in space.\n\n===Project Mercury (USA, 1959\u20131963)===<!--considering how wrong the vostok timeline was, this could probably use checking as well-->\n[[Image:Mercury Capsule2.png|thumb|left|Mercury capsule with escape tower]]\n\n[[Project Mercury]] was the first human spaceflight program of the  United States. It ran from 1959 through 1963 with the goal of putting a human in orbit around the Earth. The [[Mercury-Atlas 6]] flight on 20 February 1962 was the first Mercury flight to achieve this goal.\n\nEarly planning and research was carried out by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]], and the program was officially conducted by the newly created [[NASA]].\n\nBecause of their small size it was said that the Mercury spacecraft capsules were worn, not ridden. With {{convert|1.7|m3}} of habitable volume, the capsule was just large enough for the single crew member. Inside were 120 controls: 55 electrical switches, 30 fuses and 35 mechanical levers. The spacecraft was designed by [[Maxime Faget|Max Faget]] and NASA's Space Task Group.\n\nNASA ordered 20 production spacecraft, numbered 1 through 20, from [[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell Aircraft Company]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Five of the twenty spacecraft, #10, 12, 15, 17, and 19, were not flown. Spacecraft #3 and #4 were destroyed during uncrewed test flights. [[Mercury-Redstone 4|Spacecraft #11]] sank and was recovered from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after 38 years. Some spacecraft were modified after initial production (refurbished after launch abort, modified for longer missions, etc.) and received a letter designation after their number, examples 2A, 15B. Some spacecraft were modified twice; for example, spacecraft 15 became 15A and then 15B.\n\n===North American X-15 (USA, 1954\u20131968)===\n[[Image:X-15 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|X-15 in flight]]\nThe [[North American Aviation|North American]] X-15 [[rocket-powered aircraft]] was part of the [[X-plane (aircraft)|X-series]] of [[experimental aircraft]], initiated with the [[Bell X-1]], that were made for the [[USAF]], NASA, and the [[USN]]. The X-15 set speed and altitude records in the early 1960s, reaching the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line|edge of outer space]] and returning with valuable data used in [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]] design. It currently holds the world record for the fastest speed ever reached by a crewed aircraft.<ref name=\"Fastest\">[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/research/x15/ \"Aerospaceweb.org | Aircraft Museum X-15\".] Aerospaceweb.org, 24 November 2008.</ref>\n\nDuring the X-15 program, 13 of the flights (by eight pilots) met the USAF [[human spaceflight|spaceflight]] criteria by exceeding the altitude of {{convert|50|mi}}, thus qualifying the pilots for [[astronaut]] status; some pilots also qualified for NASA [[astronaut wings]].<ref name=\"Jenkins\">Jenkins, Dennis R.

Voskhod development was both a follow-on to the [[Vostok program]], recycling components left over from that program's cancellation following its first six flights. The two missions flown used the [[Voskhod spacecraft]] and [[Voskhod rocket|rocket]].\n\nThe Voskhod spacecraft was basically a Vostok spacecraft that had a backup, solid fuel retrorocket added to the top of the descent module. The heavier weight of the craft was made possible by improvements to the [[R-7 Semyorka]]-derived booster. The ejection seat was removed and two or three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the Vostok crew position. However, the position of the in-flight controls was not changed, so the crew had to crane their heads 90 degrees to see the instruments.\n\nWhile the Vostok program was dedicated more towards understanding the effects of space travel and microgravity on the human body, Voskhod's two flights were more aimed towards spectacular \"firsts\". Although achieving the first [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] (\"spacewalk\") became the main success of the program, beating the U.S. [[Gemini project]] to put the first multi-person crew in orbit was the objective that initially motivated the program. Once both goals were realized, the program was abandoned. This followed the change in Soviet leadership, which was less concerned about stunt and prestige flights, and allowed the Soviet designers to concentrate on the [[Soyuz program]].\n\n===Project Gemini (USA, 1965\u20131966)===\n\n[[Image:Gemini 6 7.jpg|right|250px|Gemini spacecraft on orbit]]\n[[Project Gemini]] was the second human spaceflight program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It operated between Projects Mercury and Apollo, with 10 crewed flights occurring in 1965 and 1966. Its objective was to develop techniques for advanced space travel, notably those necessary for Project Apollo, whose objective was to land humans on the Moon. Gemini missions included the first American [[Extra-vehicular activity|extravehicular activity]], and new orbital maneuvers including [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking]].\n\nGemini was originally seen as a simple extrapolation of the Mercury program, and thus early on was called ''Mercury Mark II''. The actual program had little in common with Mercury and was [[Big Gemini|superior to even Apollo in some ways]]. This was mainly a result of its late start date, which allowed it to benefit from much that had been learned during the early stages of the Apollo project (which, despite its later launch dates, was actually begun before Gemini).\n\n===Soyuz program (USSR/Russia, 1967\u2013ongoing)===\n[[Image:Soyuz rocket ASTP.jpg|thumb|left|Soyuz rocket on launch pad.]]\n\nThe [[Soyuz program]] ({{lang-ru|\u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437}}, {{IPA-ru|s\u0250\u02c8jus|pron}}, meaning \"Union\") is a human spaceflight program that was initiated by the Soviet Union in early 1967. It was originally part of a [[Moon landing]] program intended to put a Soviet [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] on the Moon. All experimental or unsuccessful starts received the status of satellites of a series [[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]], and flights of the Lunar orbital ships around the Moon \u2013 the name [[Zond program|Zond]]. Both the [[Soyuz spacecraft]] and the [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]] are part of this program, which is now the responsibility of the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]].\n\nThe basic [[Soyuz spacecraft]] design was the basis for many projects, many of which never came to light. Its earliest form was intended to travel to the moon without employing a huge booster like the [[Saturn V]] or the Soviet [[N1 rocket|N-1]] by repeatedly docking with upper stages that had been put in orbit using the same rocket as the Soyuz. This and the initial civilian designs were done under the Soviet Chief Designer [[Sergei Korolev|Sergei Pavlovich Korolev]], who did not live to see the craft take flight. Several military derivatives actually took precedence in the Soviet design process, though they never came to pass.\n\nThe launch vehicles used in the Soyuz [[expendable launch system]] are manufactured at the [[Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center]] (TsSKB-Progress) in [[Samara, Russia]]. As well as being used in the Soyuz program as the launcher for the crewed [[Soyuz spacecraft]], Soyuz launch vehicles are now also used to launch robotic [[Progress spacecraft|Progress supply spacecraft]] to the [[International Space Station]] and commercial launches marketed and operated by TsSKB-Progress and the [[Starsem]] company.  There were 11 Soyuz launches in 2001 and 9 in 2002. Currently, Soyuz vehicles are launched from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] in northwest Russia. Since 2009 Soyuz launch vehicles are also being launched from the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[French Guiana]].<ref name=sitehw>{{cite web |url=http://www.arianespace.com/news-soyuz-vega/2008/2008-10-03-Vega-Soyuz.asp |title=The Spaceport\u2019s new Soyuz launch site is ready for installation of its mission equipment |date=October 3, 2008 |publisher=[[Arianespace]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415214124/http://www.arianespace.com/news-soyuz-vega/2008/2008-10-03-Vega-Soyuz.asp |archivedate=April 15, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Apollo Program (USA, 1961\u20131975)===\n[[File:Apollo 15 Lunar Rover and Irwin.jpg|thumb|[[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] used on Apollos 15\u201317]]\n\nThe [[Apollo Program]] was undertaken by NASA during the years 1961\u20131975 with the goal of conducting crewed [[Moon landing]] missions. In 1961, [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] announced a goal of landing a man on the moon by the end of the decade.  It was accomplished on July 20, 1969, by the landing of astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]], with [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] orbiting above during the [[Apollo 11]] mission. Five other Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the [[Moon]], the last one in 1972. These six Apollo spaceflights are the only times humans have landed on another [[celestial body]].<ref>[https://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/missions.htm 30th Anniversary of Apollo 11, Manned Apollo Missions], NASA, 1999.</ref>\n\nApollo was the third human spaceflight program undertaken by NASA, the [[space agency]] of the United States. It used [[Apollo spacecraft]] and [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]] launch vehicles, which were later used for the [[Skylab|Skylab program]] and the joint American-Soviet [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. These later programs are thus often considered to be part of the overall Apollo program.\n\nThe goal of the program, as articulated by President Kennedy, was accomplished with only two major failures. The first failure resulted in the deaths of three astronauts, [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] and [[Roger Chaffee]], in the [[Apollo 1]] launchpad fire. The second was an in-space explosion on [[Apollo 13]], which badly damaged the spacecraft on the moonward leg of its journey. The three astronauts aboard narrowly escaped with their lives, thanks to the efforts of flight controllers, project engineers, backup crew members and the skills of the astronauts themselves.\n\n===Space Shuttle (USA, 1972\u20132011)===\n[[Image:STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg|thumb|Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'' launches at the start of [[STS-120]]]]\nNASA's [[Space Shuttle]], officially called \"Space Transportation System\" (STS), is the United States government's most recent crewed  launch vehicle and was retired from service in 2011. The winged [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] was launched vertically, usually carrying five to seven [[astronaut]]s (although eight have been carried) and up to {{cvt|50,000|lb}} of payload into [[low earth orbit]]. When its mission is complete, the shuttle can independently move itself out of orbit (by means of making a 180-degree turn and firing its main engines, thus slowing it down) and [[atmospheric reentry|re-enter]] the Earth's atmosphere. During descent and landing, the orbiter acts as a glider and makes a completely unpowered landing.\n\nThe Space Shuttle was the only winged crewed spacecraft to achieve orbit and land, and the only reusable space vehicle that ever made multiple flights into orbit. Its [[List of space shuttle missions|missions]] involve carrying large payloads to various orbits (including segments to be added to the [[International Space Station]]), providing crew rotation for the International Space Station, and performing service missions. The orbiter could also recover [[satellite]]s and other payloads from orbit and return them to [[Earth]], but its use in this capacity was rare. However, the Space Shuttle was used to return large payloads from the ISS to Earth, as the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]] has limited capacity for return payloads. Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches, or 10 years' operational life.\n\n===Shenzhou programme (China, 1992\u2013ongoing)===\n[[File:Post S-7 Shenzhou spacecraft.png|thumb|left]]\nThe [[Shenzhou program]] ({{zh|c=\u795e\u821f |p=Sh\u00e9n Zh\u014du}}) is a crewed  spaceflight initiative by the People's Republic of China. The program put the first Chinese citizen into orbit on 15 October 2003.\n\nDevelopment began in 1992, under the name of '''Project 921-1'''. The [[Space program of China|Chinese National Space Program]] was given the designation [[Project 921]] with Project 921-1 as its first significant goal. The plan called for a crewed launch in October 1999, prior to the new millennium. The first four robotic test flights happened in 1999, 2001 and 2002.  These were followed with three crewed launches in 2003, 2005, and 2008. Robotic and crewed launches to test docking occurred in 2011 and 2012 respectively. It is launched on the [[Long March 2F]] from the [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]].  The command center of the mission is the [[Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center]].\n\nThe name is variously translated as \"Divine Craft\", \"Divine Vessel\" or similar, but is also a reference to a literary [[Names of China|name for China]] with the same pronunciation (\u795e\u5dde; literally \"Divine Land\").\n\n===SpaceShipOne / SpaceShipTwo (USA, 2004\u2013ongoing)===\n[[File:SpaceShipOne Flight 15P photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|300px|right]]\n[[Virgin Galactic]] is a company within [[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Group]], which is developing a privately funded spacecraft called [[SpaceShipOne]] and [[SpaceShipTwo]], in conjunction with [[Scaled Composites]] to offer [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]s and later [[orbital spaceflight]]s to the paying public. SpaceShipOne reached space with a pilot in three test flights in 2004.\n\n'''Tier One''' is [[Scaled Composites]]' program of [[suborbital]] [[human spaceflight]] using the [[Reusable launch system|reusable spacecraft]] [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne]] and its launcher [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]]. The craft are designed by [[Burt Rutan]], and the project is funded 20 million US Dollars by [[Paul Allen]].  In 2004 it made the [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|first privately funded human spaceflight]] and won the 10 million US Dollars [[Ansari X Prize]] for the first non-governmental reusable crewed spacecraft.\n\nThe objective of the project is to develop technology for low-cost routine access to space.  Tier One is not itself intended to carry paying passengers, but it is envisioned that there will be commercial spinoffs, initially in [[space tourism]].  The company [[Mojave Aerospace Ventures]] was formed to manage commercial exploitation of the technology.  A deal with [[Virgin Galactic]] could see routine space tourism, using a spacecraft based on Tier One technology.\n\nThe model finally developed into [[SpaceShipTwo]], [[Virgin Galactic]]'s second generation suborbital vehicle. On 10 October 2010, VSS ''Enterprise'', the first SpaceShipTwo spaceplane, made its first crewed gliding test flight. By October 2014 SpaceShipTwo had conducted 54 test flights.<ref name=\"space20141008\">{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/27376-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-test-flight.html |title= Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo Aces Glide Test Flight |work=Space.com |date=8 October 2014 |accessdate=8 October 2014 |last=Wall |first=Mike}}</ref> On October 31, 2014, SpaceShipTwo VSS ''Enterprise'' suffered an in-flight breakup during a powered flight test,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x1143260271/SpaceShipTwo-experiences-in-flight-anomaly|title=SpaceShipTwo disaster: Industry mourns pilot but vows to keep ... - BakersfieldCalifornian.com|work=The Bakersfield Californian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023044651/http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x1143260271/SpaceShipTwo-experiences-in-flight-anomaly|archivedate=2015-10-23}}</ref><ref name = nbc_premature_deploy>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/virgin-voyage/spaceshiptwo-feather-tail-system-deployed-prematurely-ntsb-n239721|title = SpaceShipTwo 'Feather' Tail System Deployed Prematurely: NTSB|last = |first = |date = |work = }}</ref> resulting in a crash killing one pilot and injuring the other.

Two other Salyut launches failed.  Salyut was, on the one hand, designed to carry out long-term research into the problems of living in space and a variety of astronomical, biological and Earth-resources experiments, and on the other hand this civilian program was used as a cover for the highly secretive military [[Almaz]] stations, which flew under the Salyut designation. [[Salyut 1]], the first station in the program, became the world's first crewed space station. Salyut broke several [[spaceflight records]], including several mission duration records, the first ever orbital handover of a space station from one crew to another, and various spacewalk records. The program went through various changes. \n\n*[[Salyut 1]]/DOS-1 (1971, 1 crew and 1 failed docking)\n*[[Salyut 2]]/Almaz/OPS-1 (1973, failed shortly after launch)\n*[[Salyut 3]]/Almaz/OPS-2 (1974, 1 crew and 1 failed docking)\n*[[Salyut 4]]/DOS-4 (1975\u20131976, 2 crews)\n*[[Salyut 5]]/Almaz/OPS-3 (1976\u20131977, 2 crews and 1 failed docking)\n*[[Salyut 6]]/DOS-5 (1977\u20131981, 16 crews (5 long duration, 11 short duration) and 1 failed docking)\n*[[Salyut 7]]/DOS-6 (1982\u20131986, 10 crews (6 long duration, 4 short duration) and 1 failed docking)\n\n===Skylab (USA, 1973\u20131974)===\n[[File:Skylab (SL-4).jpg|thumb]]\n[[Skylab]] was launched and operated by [[NASA]] and was the [[United States]]' first space station. Skylab orbited Earth from 1973 to 1979, and included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems. It was launched uncrewed by a modified [[Saturn V]] rocket, with a weight of {{convert|169,950|lb}}. Three crewed missions to the station, conducted between 1973 and 1974 using the [[Apollo command and service module]] (CSM) atop the smaller [[Saturn IB]], each delivered a three-astronaut crew. On the last two crewed missions, an additional Apollo / Saturn IB stood by ready to rescue the crew in orbit if it was needed.\n\n===''Mir'' (USSR/Russia, 1986\u20132001)===\n[[File:Mir Space Station viewed from Endeavour during STS-89.jpg|thumb|left]]\n''[[Mir]]'' was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986&nbsp;to&nbsp;1996. It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft. Until 21 March 2001 it was the largest [[artificial satellite]] in orbit, succeeded by the [[International Space Station]] after ''Mir''{{'s}} [[Orbital decay|orbit decayed]]. The station served as a [[microgravity]] [[research]] [[laboratory]] in which crews conducted [[experiment]]s in [[biology]], [[human biology]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[meteorology]] and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space.\n\n''Mir'' was the first continuously inhabited long-term research station in orbit and set the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3,644 days until 23 October 2010 when it was surpassed by the [[International Space Station|ISS]].<ref name=\"Mirrecord\">{{cite news|last=Jackman|first=Frank|title=ISS Passing Old Russian Mir In Crewed Time|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&id=news/asd/2010/10/28/11.xml|newspaper=Aviation Week|date=29 October 2010}}</ref> It holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight, with [[Valeri Polyakov]] spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995.

Another seven Vostok flights (Vostok 7 to 13) were originally planned, going through to April 1966, but these were canceled and the components recycled into the [[Voskhod program]], which was intended to achieve more Soviet firsts in space.\n\n===Project Mercury (USA, 1959\u20131963)===<!--considering how wrong the vostok timeline was, this could probably use checking as well-->\n[[Image:Mercury Capsule2.png|thumb|left|Mercury capsule with escape tower]]\n\n[[Project Mercury]] was the first human spaceflight program of the  United States. It ran from 1959 through 1963 with the goal of putting a human in orbit around the Earth. The [[Mercury-Atlas 6]] flight on 20 February 1962 was the first Mercury flight to achieve this goal.\n\nEarly planning and research was carried out by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]], and the program was officially conducted by the newly created [[NASA]].\n\nBecause of their small size it was said that the Mercury spacecraft capsules were worn, not ridden. With {{convert|1.7|m3}} of habitable volume, the capsule was just large enough for the single crew member. Inside were 120 controls: 55 electrical switches, 30 fuses and 35 mechanical levers. The spacecraft was designed by [[Maxime Faget|Max Faget]] and NASA's Space Task Group.\n\nNASA ordered 20 production spacecraft, numbered 1 through 20, from [[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell Aircraft Company]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Five of the twenty spacecraft, #10, 12, 15, 17, and 19, were not flown. Spacecraft #3 and #4 were destroyed during uncrewed test flights. [[Mercury-Redstone 4|Spacecraft #11]] sank and was recovered from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after 38 years. Some spacecraft were modified after initial production (refurbished after launch abort, modified for longer missions, etc.) and received a letter designation after their number, examples 2A, 15B. Some spacecraft were modified twice; for example, spacecraft 15 became 15A and then 15B.\n\n===North American X-15 (USA, 1954\u20131968)===\n[[Image:X-15 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|X-15 in flight]]\nThe [[North American Aviation|North American]] X-15 [[rocket-powered aircraft]] was part of the [[X-plane (aircraft)|X-series]] of [[experimental aircraft]], initiated with the [[Bell X-1]], that were made for the [[USAF]], NASA, and the [[USN]]. The X-15 set speed and altitude records in the early 1960s, reaching the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line|edge of outer space]] and returning with valuable data used in [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]] design. It currently holds the world record for the fastest speed ever reached by a crewed aircraft.<ref name=\"Fastest\">[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/research/x15/ \"Aerospaceweb.org | Aircraft Museum X-15\".] Aerospaceweb.org, 24 November 2008.</ref>\n\nDuring the X-15 program, 13 of the flights (by eight pilots) met the USAF [[human spaceflight|spaceflight]] criteria by exceeding the altitude of {{convert|50|mi}}, thus qualifying the pilots for [[astronaut]] status; some pilots also qualified for NASA [[astronaut wings]].<ref name=\"Jenkins\">Jenkins, Dennis R.

Voskhod development was both a follow-on to the [[Vostok program]], recycling components left over from that program's cancellation following its first six flights. The two missions flown used the [[Voskhod spacecraft]] and [[Voskhod rocket|rocket]].\n\nThe Voskhod spacecraft was basically a Vostok spacecraft that had a backup, solid fuel retrorocket added to the top of the descent module. The heavier weight of the craft was made possible by improvements to the [[R-7 Semyorka]]-derived booster. The ejection seat was removed and two or three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the Vostok crew position. However, the position of the in-flight controls was not changed, so the crew had to crane their heads 90 degrees to see the instruments.\n\nWhile the Vostok program was dedicated more towards understanding the effects of space travel and microgravity on the human body, Voskhod's two flights were more aimed towards spectacular \"firsts\". Although achieving the first [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] (\"spacewalk\") became the main success of the program, beating the U.S. [[Gemini project]] to put the first multi-person crew in orbit was the objective that initially motivated the program. Once both goals were realized, the program was abandoned. This followed the change in Soviet leadership, which was less concerned about stunt and prestige flights, and allowed the Soviet designers to concentrate on the [[Soyuz program]].\n\n===Project Gemini (USA, 1965\u20131966)===\n\n[[Image:Gemini 6 7.jpg|right|250px|Gemini spacecraft on orbit]]\n[[Project Gemini]] was the second human spaceflight program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It operated between Projects Mercury and Apollo, with 10 crewed flights occurring in 1965 and 1966. Its objective was to develop techniques for advanced space travel, notably those necessary for Project Apollo, whose objective was to land humans on the Moon. Gemini missions included the first American [[Extra-vehicular activity|extravehicular activity]], and new orbital maneuvers including [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking]].\n\nGemini was originally seen as a simple extrapolation of the Mercury program, and thus early on was called ''Mercury Mark II''. The actual program had little in common with Mercury and was [[Big Gemini|superior to even Apollo in some ways]]. This was mainly a result of its late start date, which allowed it to benefit from much that had been learned during the early stages of the Apollo project (which, despite its later launch dates, was actually begun before Gemini).\n\n===Soyuz program (USSR/Russia, 1967\u2013ongoing)===\n[[Image:Soyuz rocket ASTP.jpg|thumb|left|Soyuz rocket on launch pad.]]\n\nThe [[Soyuz program]] ({{lang-ru|\u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437}}, {{IPA-ru|s\u0250\u02c8jus|pron}}, meaning \"Union\") is a human spaceflight program that was initiated by the Soviet Union in early 1967. It was originally part of a [[Moon landing]] program intended to put a Soviet [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] on the Moon. All experimental or unsuccessful starts received the status of satellites of a series [[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]], and flights of the Lunar orbital ships around the Moon \u2013 the name [[Zond program|Zond]]. Both the [[Soyuz spacecraft]] and the [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]] are part of this program, which is now the responsibility of the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]].\n\nThe basic [[Soyuz spacecraft]] design was the basis for many projects, many of which never came to light. Its earliest form was intended to travel to the moon without employing a huge booster like the [[Saturn V]] or the Soviet [[N1 rocket|N-1]] by repeatedly docking with upper stages that had been put in orbit using the same rocket as the Soyuz. This and the initial civilian designs were done under the Soviet Chief Designer [[Sergei Korolev|Sergei Pavlovich Korolev]], who did not live to see the craft take flight. Several military derivatives actually took precedence in the Soviet design process, though they never came to pass.\n\nThe launch vehicles used in the Soyuz [[expendable launch system]] are manufactured at the [[Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center]] (TsSKB-Progress) in [[Samara, Russia]]. As well as being used in the Soyuz program as the launcher for the crewed [[Soyuz spacecraft]], Soyuz launch vehicles are now also used to launch robotic [[Progress spacecraft|Progress supply spacecraft]] to the [[International Space Station]] and commercial launches marketed and operated by TsSKB-Progress and the [[Starsem]] company.  There were 11 Soyuz launches in 2001 and 9 in 2002. Currently, Soyuz vehicles are launched from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] in northwest Russia. Since 2009 Soyuz launch vehicles are also being launched from the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[French Guiana]].<ref name=sitehw>{{cite web |url=http://www.arianespace.com/news-soyuz-vega/2008/2008-10-03-Vega-Soyuz.asp |title=The Spaceport\u2019s new Soyuz launch site is ready for installation of its mission equipment |date=October 3, 2008 |publisher=[[Arianespace]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415214124/http://www.arianespace.com/news-soyuz-vega/2008/2008-10-03-Vega-Soyuz.asp |archivedate=April 15, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Apollo Program (USA, 1961\u20131975)===\n[[File:Apollo 15 Lunar Rover and Irwin.jpg|thumb|[[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] used on Apollos 15\u201317]]\n\nThe [[Apollo Program]] was undertaken by NASA during the years 1961\u20131975 with the goal of conducting crewed [[Moon landing]] missions. In 1961, [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] announced a goal of landing a man on the moon by the end of the decade.  It was accomplished on July 20, 1969, by the landing of astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]], with [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] orbiting above during the [[Apollo 11]] mission. Five other Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the [[Moon]], the last one in 1972. These six Apollo spaceflights are the only times humans have landed on another [[celestial body]].<ref>[https://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/missions.htm 30th Anniversary of Apollo 11, Manned Apollo Missions], NASA, 1999.</ref>\n\nApollo was the third human spaceflight program undertaken by NASA, the [[space agency]] of the United States. It used [[Apollo spacecraft]] and [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]] launch vehicles, which were later used for the [[Skylab|Skylab program]] and the joint American-Soviet [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. These later programs are thus often considered to be part of the overall Apollo program.\n\nThe goal of the program, as articulated by President Kennedy, was accomplished with only two major failures. The first failure resulted in the deaths of three astronauts, [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] and [[Roger Chaffee]], in the [[Apollo 1]] launchpad fire. The second was an in-space explosion on [[Apollo 13]], which badly damaged the spacecraft on the moonward leg of its journey. The three astronauts aboard narrowly escaped with their lives, thanks to the efforts of flight controllers, project engineers, backup crew members and the skills of the astronauts themselves.\n\n===Space Shuttle (USA, 1972\u20132011)===\n[[Image:STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg|thumb|Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'' launches at the start of [[STS-120]]]]\nNASA's [[Space Shuttle]], officially called \"Space Transportation System\" (STS), is the United States government's most recent crewed  launch vehicle and was retired from service in 2011. The winged [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] was launched vertically, usually carrying five to seven [[astronaut]]s (although eight have been carried) and up to {{cvt|50,000|lb}} of payload into [[low earth orbit]]. When its mission is complete, the shuttle can independently move itself out of orbit (by means of making a 180-degree turn and firing its main engines, thus slowing it down) and [[atmospheric reentry|re-enter]] the Earth's atmosphere. During descent and landing, the orbiter acts as a glider and makes a completely unpowered landing.\n\nThe Space Shuttle was the only winged crewed spacecraft to achieve orbit and land, and the only reusable space vehicle that ever made multiple flights into orbit. Its [[List of space shuttle missions|missions]] involve carrying large payloads to various orbits (including segments to be added to the [[International Space Station]]), providing crew rotation for the International Space Station, and performing service missions. The orbiter could also recover [[satellite]]s and other payloads from orbit and return them to [[Earth]], but its use in this capacity was rare. However, the Space Shuttle was used to return large payloads from the ISS to Earth, as the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]] has limited capacity for return payloads. Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches, or 10 years' operational life.\n\n===Shenzhou programme (China, 1992\u2013ongoing)===\n[[File:Post S-7 Shenzhou spacecraft.png|thumb|left]]\nThe [[Shenzhou program]] ({{zh|c=\u795e\u821f |p=Sh\u00e9n Zh\u014du}}) is a crewed  spaceflight initiative by the People's Republic of China. The program put the first Chinese citizen into orbit on 15 October 2003.\n\nDevelopment began in 1992, under the name of '''Project 921-1'''. The [[Space program of China|Chinese National Space Program]] was given the designation [[Project 921]] with Project 921-1 as its first significant goal. The plan called for a crewed launch in October 1999, prior to the new millennium. The first four robotic test flights happened in 1999, 2001 and 2002.  These were followed with three crewed launches in 2003, 2005, and 2008. Robotic and crewed launches to test docking occurred in 2011 and 2012 respectively. It is launched on the [[Long March 2F]] from the [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]].  The command center of the mission is the [[Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center]].\n\nThe name is variously translated as \"Divine Craft\", \"Divine Vessel\" or similar, but is also a reference to a literary [[Names of China|name for China]] with the same pronunciation (\u795e\u5dde; literally \"Divine Land\").\n\n===SpaceShipOne / SpaceShipTwo (USA, 2004\u2013ongoing)===\n[[File:SpaceShipOne Flight 15P photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|300px|right]]\n[[Virgin Galactic]] is a company within [[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Group]], which is developing a privately funded spacecraft called [[SpaceShipOne]] and [[SpaceShipTwo]], in conjunction with [[Scaled Composites]] to offer [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]s and later [[orbital spaceflight]]s to the paying public. SpaceShipOne reached space with a pilot in three test flights in 2004.\n\n'''Tier One''' is [[Scaled Composites]]' program of [[suborbital]] [[human spaceflight]] using the [[Reusable launch system|reusable spacecraft]] [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne]] and its launcher [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]]. The craft are designed by [[Burt Rutan]], and the project is funded 20 million US Dollars by [[Paul Allen]].  In 2004 it made the [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|first privately funded human spaceflight]] and won the 10 million US Dollars [[Ansari X Prize]] for the first non-governmental reusable crewed spacecraft.\n\nThe objective of the project is to develop technology for low-cost routine access to space.  Tier One is not itself intended to carry paying passengers, but it is envisioned that there will be commercial spinoffs, initially in [[space tourism]].  The company [[Mojave Aerospace Ventures]] was formed to manage commercial exploitation of the technology.  A deal with [[Virgin Galactic]] could see routine space tourism, using a spacecraft based on Tier One technology.\n\nThe model finally developed into [[SpaceShipTwo]], [[Virgin Galactic]]'s second generation suborbital vehicle. On 10 October 2010, VSS ''Enterprise'', the first SpaceShipTwo spaceplane, made its first crewed gliding test flight.

Two other Salyut launches failed.  Salyut was, on the one hand, designed to carry out long-term research into the problems of living in space and a variety of astronomical, biological and Earth-resources experiments, and on the other hand this civilian program was used as a cover for the highly secretive military [[Almaz]] stations, which flew under the Salyut designation. [[Salyut 1]], the first station in the program, became the world's first crewed space station. Salyut broke several [[spaceflight records]], including several mission duration records, the first ever orbital handover of a space station from one crew to another, and various spacewalk records. The program went through various changes. \n\n*[[Salyut 1]]/DOS-1 (1971, 1 crew and 1 failed docking)\n*[[Salyut 2]]/Almaz/OPS-1 (1973, failed shortly after launch)\n*[[Salyut 3]]/Almaz/OPS-2 (1974, 1 crew and 1 failed docking)\n*[[Salyut 4]]/DOS-4 (1975\u20131976, 2 crews)\n*[[Salyut 5]]/Almaz/OPS-3 (1976\u20131977, 2 crews and 1 failed docking)\n*[[Salyut 6]]/DOS-5 (1977\u20131981, 16 crews (5 long duration, 11 short duration) and 1 failed docking)\n*[[Salyut 7]]/DOS-6 (1982\u20131986, 10 crews (6 long duration, 4 short duration) and 1 failed docking)\n\n===Skylab (USA, 1973\u20131974)===\n[[File:Skylab (SL-4).jpg|thumb]]\n[[Skylab]] was launched and operated by [[NASA]] and was the [[United States]]' first space station. Skylab orbited Earth from 1973 to 1979, and included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems. It was launched uncrewed by a modified [[Saturn V]] rocket, with a weight of {{convert|169,950|lb}}. Three crewed missions to the station, conducted between 1973 and 1974 using the [[Apollo command and service module]] (CSM) atop the smaller [[Saturn IB]], each delivered a three-astronaut crew. On the last two crewed missions, an additional Apollo / Saturn IB stood by ready to rescue the crew in orbit if it was needed.\n\n===''Mir'' (USSR/Russia, 1986\u20132001)===\n[[File:Mir Space Station viewed from Endeavour during STS-89.jpg|thumb|left]]\n''[[Mir]]'' was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986&nbsp;to&nbsp;1996.
