After John Dickie resigned as a councillor in 2003, a by-election was held for the vacant position, which was won by Jill Fraser, a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], with the Labour candidate coming second. She retained her seat in the [[2006 Camden London Borough Council election|2006 election]] and was elected alongside two Labour candidates. Labour councillor Roy Shaw resigned his position in 2007 due to ill health, and in the subsequent by-election, Matt Sanders, a Liberal Democrat, was elected over the Labour candidate.<ref name=\"2007 by-election\"/>\n\nCouncillor Syed Hoque defected from the Labour Party to join the Liberal Democrats in 2009, leaving the ward represented by three Liberal Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.libdemvoice.org/camden-labour-reels-as-councillor-defects-to-the-lib-dems-11047.html|title=Camden Labour reels as councillor defects to the Lib Dems|date=6 February 2009|accessdate=1 April 2010|work=[[Liberal Democrat Voice]]|first=Jo|last=Shaw}}</ref> Hoque's death in 2010 resulted in the [[2010 Camden London Borough Council election|2010 election]] in Haverstock being delayed from 6 May to 25 May.

She retained her seat in the [[2006 Camden London Borough Council election|2006 election]] and was elected alongside two Labour candidates. Labour councillor Roy Shaw resigned his position in 2007 due to ill health, and in the subsequent by-election, Matt Sanders, a Liberal Democrat, was elected over the Labour candidate.<ref name=\"2007 by-election\"/>\n\nCouncillor Syed Hoque defected from the Labour Party to join the Liberal Democrats in 2009, leaving the ward represented by three Liberal Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.libdemvoice.org/camden-labour-reels-as-councillor-defects-to-the-lib-dems-11047.html|title=Camden Labour reels as councillor defects to the Lib Dems|date=6 February 2009|accessdate=1 April 2010|work=[[Liberal Democrat Voice]]|first=Jo|last=Shaw}}</ref> Hoque's death in 2010 resulted in the [[2010 Camden London Borough Council election|2010 election]] in Haverstock being delayed from 6 May to 25 May.
