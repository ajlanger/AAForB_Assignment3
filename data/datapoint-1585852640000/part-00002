Most other incorporated cities in the Metroplex are \"bedroom communities\" serving largely as residential and small-business centers, though there are several key employers in these regions. Due to the large number of smaller, less well-known cities, metroplex residents commonly divide the region roughly in half along Texas [[Interstate 35]], which runs north\u2013south, splitting into two 'branches' ([[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]] in Dallas and [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|I-35W]] in Fort Worth) through the Metroplex. They refer to places as being on the \"Dallas side\" or the \"Fort Worth side\", or in \"the Arlington area\", which is almost directly south of the airport. It is nominally between the two major east\u2013west interstates in the region (I-20, passing to the south of both downtowns, and I-30, connecting Dallas and Fort Worth city centers).\n\nBusiness management and operations play a central role in the area's economy. Dallas and its suburbs have the third-largest concentration of corporate headquarters in the United States. Moreover, It is the only metro area in the country home to three of the top-ten largest Fortune 500 companies by revenue.

Major professional sports first came to the area in 1952, when the [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] competed in the [[National Football League]] for one season. In 1960, major professional sports returned when The [[Dallas Cowboys]] began competing in the [[National Football League]] and the Dallas Texans began competing in the [[American Football League]]. (The Texans later relocated to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and became the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]]). In 1972, [[Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball's]] Washington Senators moved to Arlington to become the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], named after the [[Texas Ranger Division|statewide law enforcement agency]]. The [[National Basketball Association]] expanded into North Texas in 1980 when the [[Dallas Mavericks]] were added to the league. The fourth sport was added in 1993 when the [[Minnesota North Stars]] of the [[National Hockey League]] moved to Dallas, becoming the [[Dallas Stars]].\n\nThe [[Major League Soccer]] team [[FC Dallas]] is based in Frisco, and the [[Dallas Wings]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] play in Arlington. The area is also home to many minor-league professional teams, and four colleges that compete in [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] athletics. Two [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] races are hosted annually at [[Texas Motor Speedway]], the [[Duck Commander 500]] and the [[AAA Texas 500]].

Historically, the two papers had readership primarily in their own counties.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} As the two cities' suburbs have grown together in recent years (and especially since the demise of the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'' in 1991), many sites sell both papers. This pattern of crossover has been repeated in other print media, radio, and television. Since the 1970s all of the television stations and most of the FM radio stations have chosen to transmit from [[Cedar Hill, Texas|Cedar Hill]] so as to serve the entire market, and are programmed likewise. There has been a rise in \"80\u201390 move-ins\", whereby stations have been moved from distant markets, in some cases as far away as Oklahoma, and relicensed to anonymous small towns in the Metroplex to serve as additional DFW stations. According to ''[[RadioTime]],'' the market has 38 [[AM band|AM]] stations, 58 [[FM band|FM]] stations (many of them [[List of broadcast station classes|class C]]s), and 18 full-power television stations. Dallas\u2013Fort Worth is the fifth-largest television market in the United States, behind only New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia.\n\nTwo metroplex AM radio stations, 820 [[WBAP (AM)|WBAP]] and 1080 [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]], are 50,000-watt stations with coverage of much of the North American continent and beyond during nighttime hours.\n\nThe South Asian population (Indian Sub-continent) has increased considerably in the DFW metroplex. They have the FM 104.9 radio channel and 700 AM radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/2011102116350/sony-launches-free-to-air-sab-tv-in-the-us.html |title=Sony launches free-to-air SAB TV in the US |publisher=Rapid TV News |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> Recently Sony TV, a subsidiary of Sony TV Asia, launched its FTA (free to Air OTA) channel on 44.2 station in DFW.

At {{convert|17207|acre|ha|0}} of total land area, DFW is also the second-largest airport in the country and the sixth-largest in the world. It is the third-busiest airport in the world in terms of aircraft movements and the world's seventh-busiest by passenger traffic, transporting 62.9 million passengers in FY 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dfwairport.com/pressroom/DFW_Year_End_Report_Shows_Record_62_Million_Customers.php |title= DFW End Report Shows Record 62 Million Customers |accessdate=2015-11-16 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030858/https://www.dfwairport.com/pressroom/DFW_Year_End_Report_Shows_Record_62_Million_Customers.php |archivedate=2015-11-17}}</ref> Based in Fort Worth, [[American Airlines]]' headquarters are adjacent to DFW.

Based in Dallas, [[Southwest Airlines]] is headquartered next to Love Field.\n\n[[File:DFW freeways.svg|thumb|right|250px|DFW freeway map]] \nThe Dallas\u2013Fort Worth area has thousands of lane-miles of freeways and interstates. The Metroplex has the second-largest number of freeway-miles per capita in the nation, behind only the [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area]]. As in most major metropolitan areas in Texas, most interstates and freeways have access or frontage roads where most of the businesses are located; these access roads have slip ramps allowing traffic to transition between the freeway and access road. North\u2013south interstates include [[Interstate 35 (Texas)|I-35]] and [[Interstate 45 (Texas)|I-45]]. East\u2013west routes include [[Interstate 30 (Texas)|I-30]] and [[Interstate 20 (Texas)|I-20]]. I-35 splits into [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]] and [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|I-35W]] from Denton to Hillsboro: I-35W goes through Fort Worth while I-35E goes through Dallas. (This is one of only two examples of an interstate splitting off into branches and then rejoining as one; the other such split is in [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] where I-35E goes into [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and I-35W goes through [[Minneapolis]].) [[Interstate 30 (Texas)|I-30]] connects Dallas and Fort Worth, and I-45 connects Dallas to Houston. The \"multiple-of-5\" numbers used for the interstate designations are notable, as these numbers were designed to be used for major multi-state arteries of the [[U.S. Interstate Highway System]]. The North Texas region is the terminus for two of them, and I-45 is located only within Texas.\n\n[[High-occupancy vehicle lane|HOV lanes]] exist along I-35E, I-30, [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|I-635]], [[U.S. Route 67|US 67]], and [[U.S. Highway 75 (Texas)|US 75]]. I-20 bypasses both Dallas and Fort Worth to the south while its loop, [[Interstate 820 (Texas)|I-820]], goes around Fort Worth. [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|I-635]] splits to the north of I-20 and loops around east and north Dallas, ending at [[Texas State Highway 121|SH 121]] north of [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth International Airport|DFW Airport]]. I-35E, [[Texas State Highway Loop 12|Loop 12]], and [[Texas State Highway Spur 408|Spur 408]] ultimately connect to I-20 southwest of Dallas, completing the west bypass loop around Dallas. A large number of construction projects are planned or are already underway in the region to alleviate congestion. Due largely to funding issues, many of the new projects involve building new tollways or adding tolled express lanes to existing highways, which are managed by the [[North Texas Tollway Authority]]. It was originally established to manage the [[Dallas North Tollway]] and oversees several other toll projects in the area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Public transit===\n{{see also|Dallas Area Rapid Transit|Trinity Metro|Denton County Transportation Authority}}\n[[File:Dallas - Fort Worth Metroplex Rail Transit Services Map.png|left|thumbnail|Map of rail public rail transit in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth area|220x220px]]\nPublic transit options continue to expand significantly throughout the Metroplex. However, it is limited in several outlying and rural suburbs. Dallas County and portions of Collin and Rockwall counties have bus service and [[light rail]] operated by [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART), covering thirteen member cities. DART's rail network currently sprawls for 93 miles throughout the area. The Red Line extends north to Plano and southwest to Westmoreland Road. The Blue Line reaches from Rowlett in the northeast to the [[University of North Texas at Dallas]] campus near I-20 in the south. The 28-mile Green Line, which opened in December 2010, connects Carrollton in the northwest through Downtown Dallas to Pleasant Grove in the southeast. The Orange Line, which completed expansion in 2014, parallels the Red Line from Plano to Downtown Dallas and the Green Line from Downtown Dallas to Northwest Hwy before extending through the Las Colinas area of Irving to reach DFW International Airport.\n\nDenton County has bus service limited to Denton, Highland Village, and Lewisville (with commuter service to downtown Dallas) provided by the [[Denton County Transportation Authority]] (DCTA). The [[A-train (Denton County Transportation Authority)|A-train]], a diesel commuter rail line, parallels [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]] to connect Denton, Highland Village, Lewisville, and Carrollton. Several smaller towns along this line, Corinth, Shady Shores, and Lake Dallas, voted to abstain from DCTA and do not have stations. There is an across-the-platform transfer in Carrollton to the DART Green Line. A-Train service began June 20, 2011.<ref name=opening>{{cite web|url=http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/06/a-train-railway-begins-rolling.html|title=A-train railway begins rolling, carrying commuters from Denton to Carrollton|date=June 20, 2011|accessdate=June 20, 2011|first=Matt|last=Peterson|work=The Dallas Morning News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701183458/http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/06/a-train-railway-begins-rolling.html|archive-date=July 1, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nTarrant County has bus services operated by [[Trinity Metro]] (formerly the Fort Worth Transportation Authority, popularly known as 'The T'), available only in Fort Worth. It additionally operates [[TEXRail]] commuter rail, which serves to connect downtown Fort Worth with DFW Airport and the DART Orange Line. The diesel commuter train that serves Fort Worth and its eastern suburbs is operated as the [[Trinity Railway Express]]; it connects downtown Fort Worth to downtown Dallas, where it links to the DART light rail system. A station near its midpoint, Centerport, also serves DFW Airport via a free airport shuttle bus.

Most other incorporated cities in the Metroplex are \"bedroom communities\" serving largely as residential and small-business centers, though there are several key employers in these regions. Due to the large number of smaller, less well-known cities, metroplex residents commonly divide the region roughly in half along Texas [[Interstate 35]], which runs north\u2013south, splitting into two 'branches' ([[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]] in Dallas and [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|I-35W]] in Fort Worth) through the Metroplex. They refer to places as being on the \"Dallas side\" or the \"Fort Worth side\", or in \"the Arlington area\", which is almost directly south of the airport. It is nominally between the two major east\u2013west interstates in the region (I-20, passing to the south of both downtowns, and I-30, connecting Dallas and Fort Worth city centers).\n\nBusiness management and operations play a central role in the area's economy. Dallas and its suburbs have the third-largest concentration of corporate headquarters in the United States. Moreover, It is the only metro area in the country home to three of the top-ten largest Fortune 500 companies by revenue.

Major professional sports first came to the area in 1952, when the [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] competed in the [[National Football League]] for one season. In 1960, major professional sports returned when The [[Dallas Cowboys]] began competing in the [[National Football League]] and the Dallas Texans began competing in the [[American Football League]]. (The Texans later relocated to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and became the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]]). In 1972, [[Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball's]] Washington Senators moved to Arlington to become the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], named after the [[Texas Ranger Division|statewide law enforcement agency]]. The [[National Basketball Association]] expanded into North Texas in 1980 when the [[Dallas Mavericks]] were added to the league. The fourth sport was added in 1993 when the [[Minnesota North Stars]] of the [[National Hockey League]] moved to Dallas, becoming the [[Dallas Stars]].\n\nThe [[Major League Soccer]] team [[FC Dallas]] is based in Frisco, and the [[Dallas Wings]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] play in Arlington. The area is also home to many minor-league professional teams, and four colleges that compete in [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] athletics. Two [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] races are hosted annually at [[Texas Motor Speedway]], the [[Duck Commander 500]] and the [[AAA Texas 500]].

Historically, the two papers had readership primarily in their own counties.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} As the two cities' suburbs have grown together in recent years (and especially since the demise of the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'' in 1991), many sites sell both papers. This pattern of crossover has been repeated in other print media, radio, and television. Since the 1970s all of the television stations and most of the FM radio stations have chosen to transmit from [[Cedar Hill, Texas|Cedar Hill]] so as to serve the entire market, and are programmed likewise. There has been a rise in \"80\u201390 move-ins\", whereby stations have been moved from distant markets, in some cases as far away as Oklahoma, and relicensed to anonymous small towns in the Metroplex to serve as additional DFW stations. According to ''[[RadioTime]],'' the market has 38 [[AM band|AM]] stations, 58 [[FM band|FM]] stations (many of them [[List of broadcast station classes|class C]]s), and 18 full-power television stations. Dallas\u2013Fort Worth is the fifth-largest television market in the United States, behind only New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia.\n\nTwo metroplex AM radio stations, 820 [[WBAP (AM)|WBAP]] and 1080 [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]], are 50,000-watt stations with coverage of much of the North American continent and beyond during nighttime hours.\n\nThe South Asian population (Indian Sub-continent) has increased considerably in the DFW metroplex. They have the FM 104.9 radio channel and 700 AM radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/2011102116350/sony-launches-free-to-air-sab-tv-in-the-us.html |title=Sony launches free-to-air SAB TV in the US |publisher=Rapid TV News |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> Recently Sony TV, a subsidiary of Sony TV Asia, launched its FTA (free to Air OTA) channel on 44.2 station in DFW.

At {{convert|17207|acre|ha|0}} of total land area, DFW is also the second-largest airport in the country and the sixth-largest in the world. It is the third-busiest airport in the world in terms of aircraft movements and the world's seventh-busiest by passenger traffic, transporting 62.9 million passengers in FY 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dfwairport.com/pressroom/DFW_Year_End_Report_Shows_Record_62_Million_Customers.php |title= DFW End Report Shows Record 62 Million Customers |accessdate=2015-11-16 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030858/https://www.dfwairport.com/pressroom/DFW_Year_End_Report_Shows_Record_62_Million_Customers.php |archivedate=2015-11-17}}</ref> Based in Fort Worth, [[American Airlines]]' headquarters are adjacent to DFW.

Based in Dallas, [[Southwest Airlines]] is headquartered next to Love Field.\n\n[[File:DFW freeways.svg|thumb|right|250px|DFW freeway map]] \nThe Dallas\u2013Fort Worth area has thousands of lane-miles of freeways and interstates. The Metroplex has the second-largest number of freeway-miles per capita in the nation, behind only the [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area]]. As in most major metropolitan areas in Texas, most interstates and freeways have access or frontage roads where most of the businesses are located; these access roads have slip ramps allowing traffic to transition between the freeway and access road. North\u2013south interstates include [[Interstate 35 (Texas)|I-35]] and [[Interstate 45 (Texas)|I-45]]. East\u2013west routes include [[Interstate 30 (Texas)|I-30]] and [[Interstate 20 (Texas)|I-20]]. I-35 splits into [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]] and [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|I-35W]] from Denton to Hillsboro: I-35W goes through Fort Worth while I-35E goes through Dallas. (This is one of only two examples of an interstate splitting off into branches and then rejoining as one; the other such split is in [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] where I-35E goes into [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and I-35W goes through [[Minneapolis]].) [[Interstate 30 (Texas)|I-30]] connects Dallas and Fort Worth, and I-45 connects Dallas to Houston. The \"multiple-of-5\" numbers used for the interstate designations are notable, as these numbers were designed to be used for major multi-state arteries of the [[U.S. Interstate Highway System]]. The North Texas region is the terminus for two of them, and I-45 is located only within Texas.\n\n[[High-occupancy vehicle lane|HOV lanes]] exist along I-35E, I-30, [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|I-635]], [[U.S. Route 67|US 67]], and [[U.S. Highway 75 (Texas)|US 75]]. I-20 bypasses both Dallas and Fort Worth to the south while its loop, [[Interstate 820 (Texas)|I-820]], goes around Fort Worth. [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|I-635]] splits to the north of I-20 and loops around east and north Dallas, ending at [[Texas State Highway 121|SH 121]] north of [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth International Airport|DFW Airport]]. I-35E, [[Texas State Highway Loop 12|Loop 12]], and [[Texas State Highway Spur 408|Spur 408]] ultimately connect to I-20 southwest of Dallas, completing the west bypass loop around Dallas. A large number of construction projects are planned or are already underway in the region to alleviate congestion. Due largely to funding issues, many of the new projects involve building new tollways or adding tolled express lanes to existing highways, which are managed by the [[North Texas Tollway Authority]]. It was originally established to manage the [[Dallas North Tollway]] and oversees several other toll projects in the area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Public transit===\n{{see also|Dallas Area Rapid Transit|Trinity Metro|Denton County Transportation Authority}}\n[[File:Dallas - Fort Worth Metroplex Rail Transit Services Map.png|left|thumbnail|Map of rail public rail transit in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth area|220x220px]]\nPublic transit options continue to expand significantly throughout the Metroplex. However, it is limited in several outlying and rural suburbs. Dallas County and portions of Collin and Rockwall counties have bus service and [[light rail]] operated by [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART), covering thirteen member cities. DART's rail network currently sprawls for 93 miles throughout the area. The Red Line extends north to Plano and southwest to Westmoreland Road. The Blue Line reaches from Rowlett in the northeast to the [[University of North Texas at Dallas]] campus near I-20 in the south. The 28-mile Green Line, which opened in December 2010, connects Carrollton in the northwest through Downtown Dallas to Pleasant Grove in the southeast. The Orange Line, which completed expansion in 2014, parallels the Red Line from Plano to Downtown Dallas and the Green Line from Downtown Dallas to Northwest Hwy before extending through the Las Colinas area of Irving to reach DFW International Airport.\n\nDenton County has bus service limited to Denton, Highland Village, and Lewisville (with commuter service to downtown Dallas) provided by the [[Denton County Transportation Authority]] (DCTA). The [[A-train (Denton County Transportation Authority)|A-train]], a diesel commuter rail line, parallels [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]] to connect Denton, Highland Village, Lewisville, and Carrollton. Several smaller towns along this line, Corinth, Shady Shores, and Lake Dallas, voted to abstain from DCTA and do not have stations. There is an across-the-platform transfer in Carrollton to the DART Green Line. A-Train service began June 20, 2011.<ref name=opening>{{cite web|url=http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/06/a-train-railway-begins-rolling.html|title=A-train railway begins rolling, carrying commuters from Denton to Carrollton|date=June 20, 2011|accessdate=June 20, 2011|first=Matt|last=Peterson|work=The Dallas Morning News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701183458/http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/06/a-train-railway-begins-rolling.html|archive-date=July 1, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nTarrant County has bus services operated by [[Trinity Metro]] (formerly the Fort Worth Transportation Authority, popularly known as 'The T'), available only in Fort Worth. It additionally operates [[TEXRail]] commuter rail, which serves to connect downtown Fort Worth with DFW Airport and the DART Orange Line. The diesel commuter train that serves Fort Worth and its eastern suburbs is operated as the [[Trinity Railway Express]]; it connects downtown Fort Worth to downtown Dallas, where it links to the DART light rail system. A station near its midpoint, Centerport, also serves DFW Airport via a free airport shuttle bus.
