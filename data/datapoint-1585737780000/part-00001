The neuropsychologist scrutinizes the process to see if there are any intellectual problems exhibited. Alterations can be made to the test by simply adding, or lessening the time the person has to complete the test. After using the Boston process approach, the clinician looks at the outcomes to make conclusions on what is going on in the brain. These conclusions are based on the errors that occurred during the test. The point of looking at the errors is to see what issues may have occurred when trying to process the information and answer the question in order to evaluate the specific deficit(s).<ref>Hebben, N., Kaplan, E. and Milberg, W.

During the task the patient is asked to recreate a viewed pattern by arranging a set of blocks that have colored patterns on each side, The examiner observes the method by which the patient approaches and solves the problem, focusing, for example, on what quadrant the patient started at, which hand was used to arrange the blocks, whether the patient rotated the blocks on the table or had to lift them into space, if the image produced was either a mirror image or reversal of the pattern that the patient was supposed to create, and which side the patient made more errors on.<ref>Hebben, N., Kaplan, E. and Milberg, W.

Data interpretation from this approach does not necessarily look at the final score on the tests, rather it focuses on what kind of errors were made by the individual during the assessment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Edith|date=1988|title=The Process Approach to Neuropsychological Assessment|url=|journal=Aphasiology|volume=2.3-4|issue=3\u20134|pages=309\u2013311|via=Web|doi=10.1080/02687038808248930}}</ref> Results from the Boston process approach allow the clinician to make inferences about what brain areas may not be working properly in the individual. The clinician can then also make inferences about how severe the damage to the brain is by determining whether there is low-level or higher-level deficits in their cognitive processing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Boston Process Approach to Neuropsychological Assessment|last=Hebben|first=N|last2=Kaplan|first2=Edith|last3=Milberg|first3=W.P.|publisher=Oxford Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199702800|location=New York, NY|pages=42\u201365}}</ref>\n\n==Critiques==\nA major criticism of this approach is on its [[external validity]]. The problems occur due to differences in outcome between administrators. There have also been issues in regards to the lack of consistent patterns and methods for each diagnosis (Milberg & Hebben, 2013). This neuropsychological flexible battery approach allows for administrators to choose which tests they want to use, however, it makes room for the lack of consistency in choosing the tests for each type of neurological issue. Accordingly, there are questions about the empirical validity of the Boston Process Approach. With that being said, the Boston Process Approach revolutionized the field of clinical psychology and is still widely used today (Milberg & Hebben, 2013).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.
