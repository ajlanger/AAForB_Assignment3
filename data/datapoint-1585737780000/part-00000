By 1902, the trail was replaced with a toll road, called King's Toll Road, after Samuel King. King was an early settler who also operated the toll [[ferry]] used prior to the construction of the [[Dewey Bridge]]. Rocks inscribed with \"Kings Toll Road\" can still be found along the roadway. While the road did improve travel, it was not built high enough above the river level and was often flooded.<ref name=\"grandmemories\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|U.S. Roads|Colorado|Utah}}\n* [[Grand Mesa Scenic and Historic Byway]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway}}\n* [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/2474 Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway], Federal Highway Administration\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111113154915/http://dinosaurdiamond.org/ Dinosaur Diamond Scenic Byway at dinosaurdiamond.org] - via the Wayback Machine\n* [http://www.utah.com/byways/dinosaur_diamond.htm Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway], Utah Office of Tourism\n\n[[Category:National Scenic Byways in Colorado]]\n[[Category:Utah Scenic Byways]]\n[[Category:Colorado Scenic Byways]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Carbon County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Duchesne County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Grand County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Emery County, Utah|Transportation in Emery County]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Moffat County, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Rio Blanco County, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Garfield County, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Mesa County, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Carbon County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Duchesne County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Grand County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Emery County, Utah|Visitor attractions in Emery County]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Moffat County, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Rio Blanco County, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Garfield County, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Mesa County, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Interstate 70]]\n[[Category:U.S. Route 6]]\n[[Category:U.S. Route 40]]\n[[Category:U.S. Route 50]]\n[[Category:2002 establishments in Colorado]]\n[[Category:2002 establishments in Utah]]\n", "name_user": "An Errant Knight", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Diamond_Prehistoric_Highway"}
