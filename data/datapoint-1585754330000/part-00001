Now known as [[BBC World News]].\n* BBC Prime: a 24-hour English subscription lifestyle, variety and entertainment channel such: variety, culture, leisure, lifestyle, art and light entertainment programmes. Now known as [[BBC Entertainment]].\n\n==Programming==\nThe channel broadcast drama, comedy and lifestyle programmes which it repeated on a monthly basis. Once, it allocated six hours per day to educational programmes from BBC Learning (shown in the European [[small hours]]); this practice was abandoned in August 2006 \"with the intention of improving the relevance and appeal of the channel to the widest audience\".<ref>[http://www.bbcprime.com/faq.aspx?menu=FAQs#1428e2f1-b0be-4cfa-b1f4-f13160d22b1b BBC Prime \u2013 faqs Why has BBC LEARNING ended?]{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It also included a special children's strand, using the [[CBBC]] brand and idents, by the name of CBBC on BBC Prime, or CBBC Prime.\n\nWhen it first launched, BBC Prime also carried programming from the former [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] company [[Thames Television]], since [[BBC Worldwide]] had a joint venture with Thames's parent company, [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] and [[Cox Communications]], known as European Channel Management.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/from-us-to-them-how-the-bbc-became-a-world-player-1235473.html From us to them; How the BBC became a world player], ''[[The Independent]]'', 11 October 1997</ref> However, this was dissolved in 1998.<ref>[https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/bbc-to-buy-out-int-l-partners-1117468821/ BBC to buy out int'l partners], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', March 16, 1998</ref> Owing to rights issues, much of the programming on BBC Prime was from the Corporation's archive. \n\n===Controversy===\nThe channel's emphasis on archive programming caused considerable annoyance to many British [[expatriate]] viewers, who had much preferred the mix of BBC One and [[BBC Two|Two]] previously offered by [[BBC TV Europe]] and [[BBC World Service Television]].

This prompted [[Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation|GBC]] in Gibraltar to end terrestrial retransmission of BBC Prime in 1999. Even after the BBC switched to broadcasting [[BBC#Unencrypted satellite transmissions|unencrypted]] on a [[Astra 2D|satellite with a much weaker signal]], many people in Spain and elsewhere could still receive these signals, particularly those who already had large satellite dishes.\n\n==Funding==\nUnlike the BBC's domestic channels, and some of their foreign channels paid for by the [[UK Foreign Office]], BBC Prime was funded by [[pay television|subscription]] available either as part of a satellite package or as a stand-alone channel. It was also funded by adverts placed on the channel in breaks, and because of this, it was not available in the UK. Much of BBC Prime's programming was available to watch through [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two|Two]] or the [[UKTV]] network, part owned by the BBC and showing archive programming.\n\n== Presentation ==\nWhen BBC Prime launched, its ident was consisted of 5 different diamonds shining, at first by each other, and then all of them, in a black background, with the BBC Prime logo placed in the bottom right corner. The logo at the time had the BBC logo, with \"Prime\" written in all capitals below in the Trajan Bold font. The ident had another version which had a quite jazz-styled music.\n\nOn 4 October 1997, the BBC went on a major rebrand, and BBC Prime was also affected by it. The logo now had the BBC blocks, with \"Prime\" in all capitals in the Gill Sans font next to it. The idents start with epileptic water scenes with full of colours, before settling on the main part of the ident, which features the water in a blue to orange gradient with ripples, and 2 marbles reflected and inverted by each other, with the logo being placed in the bottom.\n\nIn December 2000, BBC Prime rebranded again. The idents now featured cartoon draws of famous UK sights, like the Big Ben, the Tower Bridge or the Stonehenge, shooting fireworks, before the looped, 15-second long sequence with exploding firework animations came on. The idents had a xylophone-and-trumpet music, with firework sounds playing in the background.\n\nBBC Prime's final rebrand took place in August 2006, when BBC Learning was discontinued and the channel's gradual replacement started. The logo featured the 1997 logo being placed inside a turquoise circle. The idents consisted of differently coloured circles as people who do different situations, like going on a rollercoaster, jumping and swimming in the pool, or the grass being clipped with a lawnrower. These idents were used until BBC Prime was completely replaced by BBC Entertainment on 11 November 2009.\n\n==Availability==\nThe channel was available in many areas through [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[cable television]]\n*In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], the channel was available on cable, alongside [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]] and [[BBC World News]].\n*It was available on [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Malta]].\n*In [[Gibraltar]], [[Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation|GBC]] relayed BBC Prime  on its VHF and UHF channels with opt-outs.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&id=TTe4AAAAIAAJ&dq=%22bbc+prime%22+gibraltar&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22bbc+prime%22+ ''Handbook \u2013 Commonwealth Broadcasting Association''], Secretariat, Commonwealth Broadcasting Association, 1997, page 59</ref>\n*In [[Turkey]], it was available on [[Turksat (company)|T\u00fcrksat]] Cable TV and [[Digiturk]].\n*In [[Italy]], it was available on [[SKY Italia]].\n*In [[MENA]], it was available on the [[Orbit Communications Company|Orbit Network]].\n*The [[South Africa]] service was launched in 1999 and contained some different programmes to that broadcast in Europe, due to some programmes already being licensed to other channels.\n*The [[Asia]] service was launched on 1 December 2004 and had a different schedule to that of the Europe service to reflect the different time zones, and cultural practices.
