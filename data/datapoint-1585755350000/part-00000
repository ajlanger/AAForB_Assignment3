{"title_page": "List of Facebook features", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Original research|date=August 2012}}\n{{lead too short|date=March 2015}}\n{{advert|date=March 2016}}\n}}\n'''Facebook''' is a social network service website launched on February 4, 2004 by [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. The following is a list of software and technology features that can be found on the Facebook website and mobile app and are available to users of the [[social media]] site.\n\n== Facebook structure ==\n=== News Feed ===\n{{Main|News Feed}}\nThe news feed is the primary system through which users are exposed to content posted on the network. Using a secret method (initially known as [[EdgeRank]]), Facebook selects a handful of updates to actually show users every time they visit their feed, out of an average of 1500 updates they can potentially receive.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Robinson|last1=Meyer|title=Everything We Know About Facebook's Secret Mood Manipulation Experiment|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/|newspaper=The Atlantic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/business/news/News-Feed-FYI-A-Window-Into-News-Feed|title=Facebook for Business|work=Facebook for Business|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn September 6, 2006, [[Ruchi Sanghvi]] announced a new home page feature called News Feed. Originally, when users logged into Facebook, they were presented with a customizable version of their own profile. The new layout, by contrast, created an alternative home page in which users saw a constantly updated list of their friends' Facebook activity. News Feed highlights information that includes profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays, among other updates. This has enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause. News Feed also shows conversations taking place between the walls of a user's friends. An integral part of the News Feed interface is the Mini Feed, a news stream on the user's profile page that shows updates about that user. Unlike in the News Feed, the user can delete events from the Mini Feed after they appear so that they are no longer visible to profile visitors. In 2011 Facebook updated the News Feed to show top stories and most recent stories in one feed, and the option to highlight stories to make them top stories, as well as to un-highlight stories. In response to users' criticism, Facebook later updated the News Feed to allow users to view recent stories first.\n\nInitially, the addition of the News Feed caused some discontent among Facebook users. Many users complained that the News Feed was too cluttered with excess information. Others were concerned that the News Feed made it too easy for other people to track activities like changes in relationship status, events, and conversations with other users. This tracking is often casually referred to as \"Facebook-Stalking\". In response to this dissatisfaction, creator [[Mark Zuckerberg]] issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Thereafter, users were able to control what types of information were shared automatically with friends. Currently, users may prevent friends from seeing updates about several types of especially private activities, although other events are not customizable in this way.\n\nWith the introduction of the \"New Facebook\" in early February 2010 came a complete redesign of the pages, several new features and changes to News Feeds. On their personal Feeds (now integrated with Walls), users were given the option of removing updates from any application as well as choosing the size they show up on the page. Furthermore, the community feed (containing recent actions by the user's friends) contained options to instantly select whether to hear more or less about certain friends or applications.\n\nOn March 7, 2013, Facebook announced a redesigned newsfeed.\n\n=== Friends ===\n{{Also|Friending}}\n\n\"Friending\" someone on the platform is the act of sending another user a \"friend request\" on Facebook. The two people are Facebook friends once the receiving party accepts the friend request. In addition to accepting the request, the user has the option of declining the friend request or hiding it using the \"Not Now\" feature. Deleting a friend request removes the request, but does allow the sender to resend it in the future. The \"Not Now\" feature hides the request but does not delete it, allowing the receiver to revisit the request at a later date.\n\nIt is also possible to remove a user from one's friends, which is referred to as \"unfriending\" by Facebook.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=172936839431357 | title = How do I unfriend or delete a friend? | publisher = Facebook }}</ref> Many Facebook users also refer to the process as \"de-friending\".<ref name=\"PHILIP GALANES\">{{ cite news | last= GALANES | first= PHILIP | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/fashion/24social.html | title= De-Friend Me?

This was discontinued due to privacy concerns and changes to the API.\n\n=== Wall ===\nThe Wall is the original profile space where Facebook users' content until December 2011 was displayed. It allowed the posting of messages, often short or temporal notes, for the user to see while displaying the time and date the message was written. A user's Wall is visible to anyone with the ability to see his or her full profile, and friends' Wall posts appear in the user's News Feed.\n\nIn July 2007, Facebook allowed users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas previously the Wall was limited to text only.<ref>{{cite web | last = Der | first = Kevin | url = http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=3532972130 | title = Facebook is off-the-wall | accessdate = 2007-07-30 }}</ref> In May 2008, the Wall-to-Wall for each profile was limited to only 40 posts. Facebook later allowed users to insert HTML code in boxes attached to the wall via apps like Static FBML which has allowed marketers to track use of their fan pages with Google Analytics.\n\nThe concept of tagging in status updates, an attempt to imitate Twitter,<ref name=Parr>{{cite web | last = Parr | first = Ben | url = http://mashable.com/2009/09/14/facebook-status-tagging-live/ | title = BREAKING: Facebook Introduces @Mentions in Status Updates | publisher = [[Mashable]] | date = 2009-09-10 | accessdate = 2013-08-07 }}</ref> began September 14, 2009.

This included when information was changed, when they changed their profile picture, and when they connected with new people, among other things.\n\nThe Wall has been replaced by the Timeline profile layout, which was introduced in December 2011.\n\n=== Timeline ===\nIn September 2011, Facebook introduced \"Timeline\" at its [[Facebook F8|developer conference]], intended to revamp users' profiles in order to show content based on year, month and date. \"Cover\" photos were introduced, taking up a significant portion of the top of pages, and a redesigned display of personal information such as friends, likes and photos appeared on the left-hand side, while story posts appeared on the right. The new design introduced flexible sizing for story posts in the feed, along with more prominent location and photo placement. The Timeline also encouraged scrolling, with constantly loading story posts of users' pasts.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jacob |last=Schulman |title=Facebook Timeline preview and photos: a personal tour |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/09/22/facebook-timeline |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=December 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Nancy |last=Messieh |title=New to Facebook\u2019s Timeline?

It also announced that third-party developers could integrate their apps into Messenger, letting users enter an app while inside Messenger and optionally share details from the app into a chat.<ref>{{cite web |first=Hope |last=King |title=7 big changes coming to Facebook |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/25/technology/facebook-f8-messenger/ |website=[[CNN]] |date=March 25, 2015 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}</ref> In April 2016, it introduced an [[API]] for developers to build [[Software agent|chatbots]] into Messenger, for uses such as news publishers building bots to give users news through the service,<ref>{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Facebook launches a bot platform for Messenger |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/12/11395806/facebook-messenger-bot-platform-announced-f8-conference |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=April 12, 2016 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}</ref> and in April 2017, it enabled the [[M (virtual assistant)|M virtual assistant]] for users in the U.S., which scans chats for keywords and suggests relevant actions, such as its payments system for users mentioning money.<ref>{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Statt |title=Facebook\u2019s AI assistant will now offer suggestions inside Messenger |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/6/15200836/facebook-messenger-m-suggestions-ai-assisant |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=April 6, 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook Messenger\u2019s AI \u2018M\u2019 suggests features to use based on your convos |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/facebook-messengers-ai-m-suggests-features-to-use-based-on-your-convos/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 6, 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}</ref> Additionally, Facebook expanded the use of bots, incorporating group chatbots into Messenger as \"Chat Extensions\", adding a \"Discovery\" tab for finding bots, and enabling special, branded [[QR code]]s that, when scanned, take the user to a specific bot.<ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook Messenger launches group bots and bot discovery tab |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/facebook-bot-discovery/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 18, 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2018, Facebook discontinued users' ability to post to their Timeline using SMS.\n\n=== Notifications   ===\nNotifications tell the user that something has been added to his or her profile page. Examples include: a message being shared on the user's wall or a comment on a picture of the user or on a picture that the user has previously commented on. Initially, notifications for events were limited to one per event; these were eventually grouped category wise. For instance, 10 users having liked a user's picture now count for one notification, whereas in the earlier stages, these would have accounted for ten separate notifications. The number of notifications can be changed in the settings section, to a maximum of 99. There is a red notification counter at the top of the page, which if clicked displays the most recent ones.\n\n=== {{anchor|Facebook Groups}}Groups ===\n[[File:Facebook advertising.jpg|thumb|Human billboard at the [[National Multicultural Festival]] advertising Canberra in the city news feed]]\nFacebook Groups can be created by individual users. Groups allow members to post content such as links, media, questions, events, editable documents, and comments on these items.\n\nGroups are used for collaboration and allow discussions, events, and numerous other activities. They are a way of enabling a number of people to come together online to share information and discuss specific subjects. They are increasingly used by clubs, companies and public sector organizations to engage with stakeholders, be they members of the public, employees, members, service users, shareholders or customers. Groups can have three different levels of privacy settings:\n* \"Open\" means both the group, its members and their comments are visible to the public (which includes non-members) but they cannot interact without joining.\n* \"Secret\" means that nothing can be viewed by the public unless a member specifically invites another user to join the group.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/help/220336891328465|title = What are the privacy options for groups?|date = |accessdate = |website = Facebook Help Center|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nPreviously, in October 2010, there were version 0 (legacy) and version 1 (current) groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434700832130 |title=New Groups: Stay Closer to Groups of People in Your Life |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> Version 1 or \"new\" groups can contain the name of the group in their URL if the email-address of the group is set. Groups do not have a RSS feed to export the wall or the member list, such as Pages or Events have, but third parties provide such service if the group is set to an \"open\" privacy setting. All groups have since been migrated to a single design.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/migrations/completed-changes#july_2013 |title=Facebook Migrations: Removing 'version' field for Groups |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2016-02-09}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n=== Events ===\nFacebook events are a way for members to let friends know about upcoming events in their community and to organize social gatherings. Events require an event name, network, host name, event type, start time, location, and a guest list of friends invited. Events can be public or private. Private events cannot be found in searches and are by invitation only. People who have not been invited cannot view a Private event's description, Wall, or photos. They also will not see any Feed stories about the event. When setting up an event the user can choose to allow friends to upload photos or videos. Note that unlike real world events, all events are treated as separate entities (when the reality is some events sit inside other events, going to one event would preclude going to another, and so on).\n\nIn February 2011, Facebook began to use the [[HCalendar|hCalendar microformat]] to mark up events, and the [[HCard|hCard microformat]] for the events' venues, enabling the extraction of details to users' own calendar or mapping applications. Third parties facilitate events to be exported from Facebook pages to the [[iCalendar]]-format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Wallflux/status/161419742261936128 |title=Twitter |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketplace ===\nIn 2007, Facebook introduced the Facebook Marketplace, allowing users to post classified ads within sale, housing, and jobs categories.<ref name=\"tc-marketplace\">{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook launches Marketplace, a friendlier Craigslist |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/facebook-marketplace-2/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 3, 2016 |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}</ref> However, the feature never gained traction, and in 2009, control was transferred to [[Oodle, Inc.|Oodle]], the platform powering the functionality. The feature was then eventually shut down in 2014.<ref name=\"tc-marketplace\"/> In October 2016, Facebook announced a new Marketplace, citing the growth of organized \"buy and sell\" Facebook Groups, and gave the new version a higher prominence in the main Facebook app, taking the navigation position previously held by [[Facebook Messenger]].<ref name=\"tc-marketplace\"/><ref>{{cite web |first=Alex |last=Heath |title=Facebook wants to replace Craigslist and eBay with a new section in its app |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-introduces-marketplace-for-buying-and-selling-items-to-replace-craigslist-2016-10 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=October 3, 2016 |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Notes ===\nFacebook Notes was introduced on August 22, 2006, as a [[blog]]ging platform offering users the ability to write notes, attach photos, and optionally import blog entries from external sources.<ref>{{cite web |first=Pete |last=Cashmore |title=Facebook Notes \u2013 Facebook Adds Blogs |url=http://mashable.com/2006/08/22/facebook-notes-facebook-adds-blogs/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=August 22, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe most known usage form of the Notes feature was the [[Internet meme]] \"25 Random Things About Me\", which involves writing 25 things about the user that their friends do not already know about them and using the tag function to ask 25 friends to do the same. The trend became popular in February 2009, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' discussing its sudden surge, noting that nearly five million notes were created for the purpose, a doubling of the feature's use in the previous week and larger than any other week in Facebook's history.<ref>{{cite web |first=Douglas |last=Quenqua |title=Ah, Yes, More About Me?

This feature is marketed as a digital version of a [[Loyalty program|loyalty card]] or coupon where a customer gets rewarded for loyal buying behavior.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=146878 | title = Facebook Ads Provide 'Deals' for Local Merchants, Marketers | accessdate = November 4, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nOn October 10, 2010, Places became available on [[BlackBerry]],<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2010-12-09 | url = http://blogs.blackberry.com/2010/11/facebook-places-blackberry/ | title = Facebook Places Now Available For BlackBerry! | publisher = Blackberry | date = 2010-11-10 |author=DISQUS, Blackberry }}</ref> [[iPhone]], and [[Android OS|Android]].

Launched on May 24, 2007, Facebook Platform has evolved from enabling development just on Facebook.com to one also supporting integration across the web and devices.\n\nFacebook Platform Statistics as of May 2010:\n* More than one million developers and entrepreneurs from more than 180 countries\n* More than 550,000 active applications currently on Facebook Platform\n* Every month, more than 70% of Facebook users engage with Platform applications\n* More than 250,000 websites have integrated with Facebook Platform\n* More than 100 million Facebook users engage with Facebook on external websites every month\n\nOn August 29, 2007, Facebook changed the way in which the popularity of applications is measured, to give attention to the more engaging applications, following criticism that ranking applications only by the number of people who had installed the application was giving an advantage to the highly [[Viral phenomenon|viral]], yet useless applications. Tech blog [[Valleywag]] has criticized Facebook Applications, labeling them a \"cornucopia of uselessness\". Others have called for limiting third-party applications so the Facebook \"user experience\" is not degraded.\n\nPrimarily attempting to create viral applications is a method that has certainly been employed by numerous Facebook application developers. [[Stanford University]] even offered a class in the Fall of 2007, entitled, Computer Science (CS) 377W: \"Create Engaging Web Applications Using Metrics and Learning on Facebook\". Numerous applications created by the class were highly successful, and ranked amongst the top Facebook applications, with some achieving over 3.5 million users in a month.\n\n=== Facebook Questions ===\nIn May 2010, Facebook began testing Questions, which is expected to compete with services such as [[Yahoo!

Also, [[JavaScript]] could not be used with FBML.\n\nAccording to the Facebook Markup Language (FBML) Developer's page, FBML is now deprecated.

The following is a list of software and technology features that can be found on the Facebook website and mobile app and are available to users of the [[social media]] site.\n\n== Facebook structure ==\n=== News Feed ===\n{{Main|News Feed}}\nThe news feed is the primary system through which users are exposed to content posted on the network. Using a secret method (initially known as [[EdgeRank]]), Facebook selects a handful of updates to actually show users every time they visit their feed, out of an average of 1500 updates they can potentially receive.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Robinson|last1=Meyer|title=Everything We Know About Facebook's Secret Mood Manipulation Experiment|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/|newspaper=The Atlantic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/business/news/News-Feed-FYI-A-Window-Into-News-Feed|title=Facebook for Business|work=Facebook for Business|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn September 6, 2006, [[Ruchi Sanghvi]] announced a new home page feature called News Feed. Originally, when users logged into Facebook, they were presented with a customizable version of their own profile. The new layout, by contrast, created an alternative home page in which users saw a constantly updated list of their friends' Facebook activity. News Feed highlights information that includes profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays, among other updates. This has enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause. News Feed also shows conversations taking place between the walls of a user's friends. An integral part of the News Feed interface is the Mini Feed, a news stream on the user's profile page that shows updates about that user. Unlike in the News Feed, the user can delete events from the Mini Feed after they appear so that they are no longer visible to profile visitors. In 2011 Facebook updated the News Feed to show top stories and most recent stories in one feed, and the option to highlight stories to make them top stories, as well as to un-highlight stories. In response to users' criticism, Facebook later updated the News Feed to allow users to view recent stories first.\n\nInitially, the addition of the News Feed caused some discontent among Facebook users. Many users complained that the News Feed was too cluttered with excess information. Others were concerned that the News Feed made it too easy for other people to track activities like changes in relationship status, events, and conversations with other users. This tracking is often casually referred to as \"Facebook-Stalking\". In response to this dissatisfaction, creator [[Mark Zuckerberg]] issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Thereafter, users were able to control what types of information were shared automatically with friends. Currently, users may prevent friends from seeing updates about several types of especially private activities, although other events are not customizable in this way.\n\nWith the introduction of the \"New Facebook\" in early February 2010 came a complete redesign of the pages, several new features and changes to News Feeds. On their personal Feeds (now integrated with Walls), users were given the option of removing updates from any application as well as choosing the size they show up on the page. Furthermore, the community feed (containing recent actions by the user's friends) contained options to instantly select whether to hear more or less about certain friends or applications.\n\nOn March 7, 2013, Facebook announced a redesigned newsfeed.\n\n=== Friends ===\n{{Also|Friending}}\n\n\"Friending\" someone on the platform is the act of sending another user a \"friend request\" on Facebook. The two people are Facebook friends once the receiving party accepts the friend request. In addition to accepting the request, the user has the option of declining the friend request or hiding it using the \"Not Now\" feature. Deleting a friend request removes the request, but does allow the sender to resend it in the future. The \"Not Now\" feature hides the request but does not delete it, allowing the receiver to revisit the request at a later date.\n\nIt is also possible to remove a user from one's friends, which is referred to as \"unfriending\" by Facebook.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=172936839431357 | title = How do I unfriend or delete a friend? | publisher = Facebook }}</ref> Many Facebook users also refer to the process as \"de-friending\".<ref name=\"PHILIP GALANES\">{{ cite news | last= GALANES | first= PHILIP | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/fashion/24social.html | title= De-Friend Me?

This was discontinued due to privacy concerns and changes to the API.\n\n=== Wall ===\nThe Wall is the original profile space where Facebook users' content until December 2011 was displayed. It allowed the posting of messages, often short or temporal notes, for the user to see while displaying the time and date the message was written. A user's Wall is visible to anyone with the ability to see his or her full profile, and friends' Wall posts appear in the user's News Feed.\n\nIn July 2007, Facebook allowed users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas previously the Wall was limited to text only.<ref>{{cite web | last = Der | first = Kevin | url = http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=3532972130 | title = Facebook is off-the-wall | accessdate = 2007-07-30 }}</ref> In May 2008, the Wall-to-Wall for each profile was limited to only 40 posts. Facebook later allowed users to insert HTML code in boxes attached to the wall via apps like Static FBML which has allowed marketers to track use of their fan pages with Google Analytics.\n\nThe concept of tagging in status updates, an attempt to imitate Twitter,<ref name=Parr>{{cite web | last = Parr | first = Ben | url = http://mashable.com/2009/09/14/facebook-status-tagging-live/ | title = BREAKING: Facebook Introduces @Mentions in Status Updates | publisher = [[Mashable]] | date = 2009-09-10 | accessdate = 2013-08-07 }}</ref> began September 14, 2009.

This included when information was changed, when they changed their profile picture, and when they connected with new people, among other things.\n\nThe Wall has been replaced by the Timeline profile layout, which was introduced in December 2011.\n\n=== Timeline ===\nIn September 2011, Facebook introduced \"Timeline\" at its [[Facebook F8|developer conference]], intended to revamp users' profiles in order to show content based on year, month and date. \"Cover\" photos were introduced, taking up a significant portion of the top of pages, and a redesigned display of personal information such as friends, likes and photos appeared on the left-hand side, while story posts appeared on the right. The new design introduced flexible sizing for story posts in the feed, along with more prominent location and photo placement. The Timeline also encouraged scrolling, with constantly loading story posts of users' pasts.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jacob |last=Schulman |title=Facebook Timeline preview and photos: a personal tour |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/09/22/facebook-timeline |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=December 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Nancy |last=Messieh |title=New to Facebook\u2019s Timeline?

Examples include: a message being shared on the user's wall or a comment on a picture of the user or on a picture that the user has previously commented on. Initially, notifications for events were limited to one per event; these were eventually grouped category wise. For instance, 10 users having liked a user's picture now count for one notification, whereas in the earlier stages, these would have accounted for ten separate notifications. The number of notifications can be changed in the settings section, to a maximum of 99. There is a red notification counter at the top of the page, which if clicked displays the most recent ones.\n\n=== {{anchor|Facebook Groups}}Groups ===\n[[File:Facebook advertising.jpg|thumb|Human billboard at the [[National Multicultural Festival]] advertising Canberra in the city news feed]]\nFacebook Groups can be created by individual users. Groups allow members to post content such as links, media, questions, events, editable documents, and comments on these items.\n\nGroups are used for collaboration and allow discussions, events, and numerous other activities. They are a way of enabling a number of people to come together online to share information and discuss specific subjects. They are increasingly used by clubs, companies and public sector organizations to engage with stakeholders, be they members of the public, employees, members, service users, shareholders or customers. Groups can have three different levels of privacy settings:\n* \"Open\" means both the group, its members and their comments are visible to the public (which includes non-members) but they cannot interact without joining.\n* \"Secret\" means that nothing can be viewed by the public unless a member specifically invites another user to join the group.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/help/220336891328465|title = What are the privacy options for groups?|date = |accessdate = |website = Facebook Help Center|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nPreviously, in October 2010, there were version 0 (legacy) and version 1 (current) groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434700832130 |title=New Groups: Stay Closer to Groups of People in Your Life |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> Version 1 or \"new\" groups can contain the name of the group in their URL if the email-address of the group is set. Groups do not have a RSS feed to export the wall or the member list, such as Pages or Events have, but third parties provide such service if the group is set to an \"open\" privacy setting. All groups have since been migrated to a single design.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/migrations/completed-changes#july_2013 |title=Facebook Migrations: Removing 'version' field for Groups |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2016-02-09}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n=== Events ===\nFacebook events are a way for members to let friends know about upcoming events in their community and to organize social gatherings. Events require an event name, network, host name, event type, start time, location, and a guest list of friends invited. Events can be public or private. Private events cannot be found in searches and are by invitation only. People who have not been invited cannot view a Private event's description, Wall, or photos. They also will not see any Feed stories about the event. When setting up an event the user can choose to allow friends to upload photos or videos. Note that unlike real world events, all events are treated as separate entities (when the reality is some events sit inside other events, going to one event would preclude going to another, and so on).\n\nIn February 2011, Facebook began to use the [[HCalendar|hCalendar microformat]] to mark up events, and the [[HCard|hCard microformat]] for the events' venues, enabling the extraction of details to users' own calendar or mapping applications. Third parties facilitate events to be exported from Facebook pages to the [[iCalendar]]-format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Wallflux/status/161419742261936128 |title=Twitter |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketplace ===\nIn 2007, Facebook introduced the Facebook Marketplace, allowing users to post classified ads within sale, housing, and jobs categories.<ref name=\"tc-marketplace\">{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook launches Marketplace, a friendlier Craigslist |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/facebook-marketplace-2/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 3, 2016 |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}</ref> However, the feature never gained traction, and in 2009, control was transferred to [[Oodle, Inc.|Oodle]], the platform powering the functionality.

The trend became popular in February 2009, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' discussing its sudden surge, noting that nearly five million notes were created for the purpose, a doubling of the feature's use in the previous week and larger than any other week in Facebook's history.<ref>{{cite web |first=Douglas |last=Quenqua |title=Ah, Yes, More About Me?

Tech blog [[Valleywag]] has criticized Facebook Applications, labeling them a \"cornucopia of uselessness\". Others have called for limiting third-party applications so the Facebook \"user experience\" is not degraded.\n\nPrimarily attempting to create viral applications is a method that has certainly been employed by numerous Facebook application developers. [[Stanford University]] even offered a class in the Fall of 2007, entitled, Computer Science (CS) 377W: \"Create Engaging Web Applications Using Metrics and Learning on Facebook\". Numerous applications created by the class were highly successful, and ranked amongst the top Facebook applications, with some achieving over 3.5 million users in a month.\n\n=== Facebook Questions ===\nIn May 2010, Facebook began testing Questions, which is expected to compete with services such as [[Yahoo!

Facebook also said it was supporting an emerging encapsulation mechanism known as [[Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol]] (LISP), which separates Internet addresses from endpoint identifiers to improve the scalability of IPv6 deployments. \"Facebook was the first major Web site on LISP (v4 and v6)\", Facebook engineers said during their presentation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Facebook said that using LISP allowed them to deploy IPv6 services quickly with no extra cost. Facebook's IPv6 services are available at www.v6.facebook.com m.v6.facebook.com, www.lisp6.facebook.com and m.lisp6.facebook.com.<ref name=\"duffy\"/> In addition, Facebook enabled IPv6 on its main domain names during [[World IPv6 Launch]].\n\n=== Listen with Friends ===\nListen with Friends allows Facebook users to listen to music and discuss the tunes using Facebook Chat with friends at the same time.

However, Facebook was still not entirely convinced, using a \"hybrid\" solution of [[Native (computing)|native computing code]] as a sort of \"picture frame\" for its mobile website. ''[[Mashable]]'' described it as a \"one-size-fits-all nightmare\".<ref name=\"Mashable mobile history\" /> In October 2011, Apple updated its iOS app with support for [[iPad]], adding larger photos and enabling more functionality, including the ability to post status updates and photos.<ref name=\"Mashable mobile history\" /> Finally, in 2012, the company relaunched its Android and iOS apps, going mobile-first and putting all of its resources into making an optimized experience for smartphones, including significant speed improvements.<ref name=\"Mashable mobile history\" /> In the years since, the company has increasingly expanded the feature set of its apps, dedicating more resources and seeing its userbase shifting from the mobile web to its apps.<ref name=\"Mashable mobile history\" />\n\nThird-party companies also created Facebook apps for their platforms.
