{"title_page": "Degree of polarization", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=December 2018}}\n{{optics-stub}}\n'''Degree of polarization''' (DOP) is a quantity used to describe the portion of an [[electromagnetic wave]] which is [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]].  A perfectly polarized wave has a DOP of 100%, whereas an unpolarized wave has a DOP of 0%.  A wave which is partially polarized, and therefore can be represented by a superposition of a polarized and unpolarized component, will have a DOP somewhere in between 0 and 100%. DOP is calculated as the fraction of the total power that is carried by the polarised component of the wave.\n\nDOP can be used to map the [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] field in materials when considering the DOP of the [[photoluminescence]]. The polarization of the photoluminescence is related to the strain in a material by way of the given material's [[photoelasticity tensor]]. \n\nDOP is also visualized using the [[Poincar\u00e9 sphere (optics)|Poincar\u00e9 sphere]] representation of a polarized beam.  In this representation, DOP is equal to the length of the [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] measured from the center of the sphere.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Axial ratio]]\n*[[Linear polarization]]\n*[[Circular polarization]]\n*[[Elliptical polarization]]\n*[[Stokes parameters]]\n\n[[Category:Polarization (waves)]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=December 2018}}\n'''Degree of polarization''' (DOP) is a quantity used to describe the portion of an [[electromagnetic wave]] which is [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]].
