He was ordered to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], but given permission to move to the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]], where a French convoy was planning to sail from.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> Problems with manning his ship meant that Knowles sailed from [[Portsmouth]] with a largely inexperienced crew, but Knowles was able to have them fully trained by the time of their arrival at [[Hampton Roads]].<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> Shortly after his arrival, the French escort arrived, and the convoy sailed shortly afterwards, observed by Knowles on the ''Daedalus''. Knowles passed this latest information on to [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], who moved his Channel fleet to intercept it, setting in motion the events that would lead to the [[Glorious First of June]].<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> Having fulfilled his objective Knowles sailed to Halifax, and from there returned to England. He was appointed to the 74-gun {{HMS|Edgar|1779|6}} and served in the [[North Sea]]. Once again Knowles was beset by difficulties in manning his ship, the ''Edgar'' put to sea from the [[Nore]] manned by soldiers from 23 different regiments, and commanded by officers from still other regiments.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> [[Typhus]] and 'the itch' were rampant, on the ship's return to port she had to be scrubbed with lime water and fumigated with vinegar, while 100 men were discharged to the hospital.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> Knowles suffered a further mishap when the ''Edgar'' was dismasted in a storm off the [[Texel]], and had to be towed back to the Nore.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/>\n\nKnowles transferred to the 74-gun {{HMS|Goliath|1781|6}} in late 1795, serving under [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]] at [[Lisbon]].<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/><ref name=\"DNB296\"/> While serving there he ran foul of Jervis, who had him court-martialled in 1796 on a charge of disobeying a verbal order. At the trial Jervis's [[captain of the fleet]] [[Robert Calder]] swore that no order had been given, and the lieutenant who was supposed to have transmitted it swore he had not received one. The charge was therefore dismissed, but this appears to have been the start of a personal enmity of Jervis against Knowles.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> The extreme animosity between Jervis and Knowles may well have originated in a conversation in 1790 reputedly overheard by Jervis, listening at the keyhole, when Knowles was warning his friend, Admiral Barrington, of Jervis' duplicitous behaviour.<ref>Harding.

During the engagement Jervis ordered his ships to tack in succession whilst in close action with the enemy.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> Knowles did so, coming under heavy fire and was forced to temporarily drop out of the action while the ''Goliath''{{'}} knotted and spliced their rigging.<ref name=\"Tracy223\">{{Cite book|last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=223}}</ref> On his return to the battle, Knowles observed an opportunity to pass to windward of the [[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (1769)|''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'']] and so becalm her. Jervis however signalled ''Goliath'' and ordered Knowles to stop the manoeuvre.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/> The following morning both Knowles on the ''Goliath'', and [[James Whitshed]] on {{HMS|Namur|1756|6}} had observed the vulnerable situation that the ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' was in, and attempted to signal this to Jervis. They received no reply.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/>\n\nThe fleet anchored in [[Lagos Bay]] the following day, with Knowles placing the ''Goliath'' where she could provide flanking cover for the line. On going aboard Jervis's flagship {{HMS|Victory}} he was however told by Jervis that the ''Goliath'' was vulnerable where she lay. Knowles replied that the Spanish were hardly likely to attack given their condition.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/> While Knowles was dining with Vice-Admiral [[William Waldegrave, 1st Baron Radstock|William Waldegrave]] that evening, Jervis sent the ''Victory''{{'}}s master to move ''Goliath'', a great insult to Knowles.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/> Jervis also ordered him to swap ships with [[Thomas Foley (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Foley]] and take over HMS ''Britannia''.

Knowles was slightly wounded during the battle.]]\nHe returned to active service again during the summer of 1778, and was present with Barrington's fleet at the [[Battle of St. Lucia]] on 15 December 1778, serving aboard Commander [[James Richard Dacres (1749\u20131810)|James Richard Dacres's]] 18-gun {{HMS|Ceres|1777|6}}.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/><ref name=\"DNB296\">{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Knowles, Charles Henry}} At p. 296.</ref> Two days later the ''Ceres'' was chased and captured by a squadron under the [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|comte d'Estaing]].<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/><ref name=\"DNB296\"/> He was [[prisoner exchange|exchanged]] and appointed to serve as lieutenant aboard Vice-Admiral Barrington's flagship, the 74-gun {{HMS|Prince of Wales|1765|6}}.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/><ref name=\"DNB296\"/> In May 1779 he was briefly ordered to be master and commander of the storeship {{HMS|Supply|1777|6}}, but had returned to the ''Prince of Wales'' by 6 July, when he took part and was wounded in the [[Battle of Grenada]].<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/><ref name=\"DNB296\"/> Knowles returned to England with Barrington in October 1779, and by December had joined Admiral Sir George Rodney's flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|Sandwich|1759|6}}, as a volunteer for the [[Relief of Gibraltar]].<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/><ref name=\"DNB296\"/>\n\n==Command==\nRodney appointed him to command the 18-gun [[xebec]] {{HMS|Minorca|1779|6}} on 26 January 1780, quickly following this with a promotion to [[post-captain]] and an appointment to the 24-gun {{HMS|Porcupine|1777|6}} on 2 February.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/><ref name=\"DNB296\"/> Knowles went on to serve in a highly active role in the defence of British trade in the Mediterranean, engaging [[privateer]]s and escorting convoys. At one point he was briefly blockaded in [[Menorca]], where he fell ill.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/><ref name=\"DNB296\"/> He was eventually able to escape to sea in January 1781, and was based out of Gibraltar until his return to England in April 1782.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> On his arrival he was accused of piracy and murder, but was able to clear his name, returning to Gibraltar aboard {{HMS|Britannia|1762|6}} to resume command of the ''Porcupine''.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/><ref name=\"DNB296\"/> He became senior naval officer there on the departure of Sir [[Roger Curtis]], until returning to England once more in command of the 74-gun Spanish prize {{HMS|San Miguel}}.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/><ref name=\"DNB296\"/>\n\n===French Revolutionary Wars===\n[[File:Capt Sir Charles Henry Knowles Bt.jpg|thumb|right|Capt Sir Charles Henry Knowles Bt]]The end of the war allowed Knowles to continue with his studies, and he made a tour of France in 1788.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> The outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1793 led to Knowles returning to active service in command of the 32-gun frigate {{HMS|Daedalus|1780|6}}. He was ordered to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], but given permission to move to the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]], where a French convoy was planning to sail from.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> Problems with manning his ship meant that Knowles sailed from [[Portsmouth]] with a largely inexperienced crew, but Knowles was able to have them fully trained by the time of their arrival at [[Hampton Roads]].<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> Shortly after his arrival, the French escort arrived, and the convoy sailed shortly afterwards, observed by Knowles on the ''Daedalus''. Knowles passed this latest information on to [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], who moved his Channel fleet to intercept it, setting in motion the events that would lead to the [[Glorious First of June]].<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> Having fulfilled his objective Knowles sailed to Halifax, and from there returned to England. He was appointed to the 74-gun {{HMS|Edgar|1779|6}} and served in the [[North Sea]]. Once again Knowles was beset by difficulties in manning his ship, the ''Edgar'' put to sea from the [[Nore]] manned by soldiers from 23 different regiments, and commanded by officers from still other regiments.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> [[Typhus]] and 'the itch' were rampant, on the ship's return to port she had to be scrubbed with lime water and fumigated with vinegar, while 100 men were discharged to the hospital.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> Knowles suffered a further mishap when the ''Edgar'' was dismasted in a storm off the [[Texel]], and had to be towed back to the Nore.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/>\n\nKnowles transferred to the 74-gun {{HMS|Goliath|1781|6}} in late 1795, serving under [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]] at [[Lisbon]].<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/><ref name=\"DNB296\"/> While serving there he ran foul of Jervis, who had him court-martialled in 1796 on a charge of disobeying a verbal order. At the trial Jervis's [[captain of the fleet]] [[Robert Calder]] swore that no order had been given, and the lieutenant who was supposed to have transmitted it swore he had not received one. The charge was therefore dismissed, but this appears to have been the start of a personal enmity of Jervis against Knowles.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> The extreme animosity between Jervis and Knowles may well have originated in a conversation in 1790 reputedly overheard by Jervis, listening at the keyhole, when Knowles was warning his friend, Admiral Barrington, of Jervis' duplicitous behaviour.<ref>Harding.

Knowles was criticised by Jervis for his actions during the engagement.]]\nKnowles was still in Jervis's fleet in command of ''Goliath'' when the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]] was fought on 14 February 1797. During the engagement Jervis ordered his ships to tack in succession whilst in close action with the enemy.<ref name=\"Tracy222\"/> Knowles did so, coming under heavy fire and was forced to temporarily drop out of the action while the ''Goliath''{{'}} knotted and spliced their rigging.<ref name=\"Tracy223\">{{Cite book|last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=223}}</ref> On his return to the battle, Knowles observed an opportunity to pass to windward of the [[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (1769)|''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'']] and so becalm her. Jervis however signalled ''Goliath'' and ordered Knowles to stop the manoeuvre.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/> The following morning both Knowles on the ''Goliath'', and [[James Whitshed]] on {{HMS|Namur|1756|6}} had observed the vulnerable situation that the ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' was in, and attempted to signal this to Jervis. They received no reply.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/>\n\nThe fleet anchored in [[Lagos Bay]] the following day, with Knowles placing the ''Goliath'' where she could provide flanking cover for the line. On going aboard Jervis's flagship {{HMS|Victory}} he was however told by Jervis that the ''Goliath'' was vulnerable where she lay. Knowles replied that the Spanish were hardly likely to attack given their condition.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/> While Knowles was dining with Vice-Admiral [[William Waldegrave, 1st Baron Radstock|William Waldegrave]] that evening, Jervis sent the ''Victory''{{'}}s master to move ''Goliath'', a great insult to Knowles.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/> Jervis also ordered him to swap ships with [[Thomas Foley (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Foley]] and take over HMS ''Britannia''. Knowles soon returned to England after this, citing poor health.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/>\n\n==Later life==\nKnowles attended the service of thanksgiving at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] on 19 December 1797 for the victories at [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|St Vincent]] and [[Battle of Camperdown|Camperdown]], receiving a [[Naval Gold Medal]],<ref name=\"DNB296\"/> and then largely retired from public life.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/> He spent the rest of his life in study, producing seven books of professional studies and a new code of signals in 1798, based on his 1777 work and incorporating revisions he had made in 1780, 1787 and 1794.<ref name=\"Tracy221\"/><ref name=\"Tracy223\"/> He was promoted to Rear-Admiral on 14 February 1799, two years to the day after the Battle of Cape St Vincent, a Vice-Admiral on 24 April 1804 and a full Admiral on 31 July 1810.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/> He suggested using balloons to observe the French invasion forces at [[Brest, France|Brest]] in 1803, and in 1830 he published his largely autobiographical work ''Observations on Naval Tactics''.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/>\n\nHe had married Charlotte Johnstone on 10 September 1800, the couple eventually having three sons and four daughters.<ref name=\"Tracy223\"/> She was the daughter of Charles Johnstone of Ludlow, brother of [[Sir Richard Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone, 1st Baronet]], of Hackness Hall. Their father Col John Johnstone was the second son of [[Sir William Johnstone, 2nd Baronet]] of Westerhall. His mother was Charlotte, Marchioness of Annandale.<ref>Ralfe, J.
