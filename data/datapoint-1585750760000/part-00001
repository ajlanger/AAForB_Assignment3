The show was created and produced by Plum Films for BBC children's channel [[CBeebies]] with support from Creative Scotland.\n\nThe concept of the series is historical fiction for young children, incorporating genuine historical artefacts into dramatic adventure stories. At the time of filming, all the artefacts featured in the show were held in museum collections around the UK.\n\n== Concept ==\n\nGreat Aunt Lizzie tells wonderful tales of adventure to entertain her young visitors, Charlotte, Lokesh and Elliot. When either one arrives at the house she offers them a cup of tea, but first they have to choose a teacup from her vast collection which she keeps in an enormous dresser in the kitchen. Each cup is unique and illustrated with one of the museum artefacts. As their Great Aunt begins to tell its story, the young guest begins to imagine being there as the tale unfolds.\n\nKay Benbow, Director of Children's Television, said, \"This is a first for CBeebies to bring ancient history and archaeology to our young audience. The series combines story telling with high adventure in a way that will inspire and encourage children to want to learn more about life in ancient times. I think children will love going on the adventures with Charlotte [and Elliot or Lokesh] to discover more about what life was like thousands of years ago.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Teacup Travels takes CBeebies viewers on voyage of discovery|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/cbeebies-teacup-travels|website=BBC Media Centre}}</ref>\n\n== Key cast ==\n*[[Gemma Jones]] as Great Aunt Lizzie\n*[[Evie Brassington]] as Charlotte\n*[[Kemaal Deen-Ellis]] as Lokesh\n*[[Roderick Gilkison]] as Elliot\n\n== Series one ==\nSeries one sees Charlotte and her brother Elliot having epic adventures in Ancient Rome, Imperial China, Ancient Egypt and the pre-medieval Celtic lands, spanning a period from 2500 BCE to 1850 CE.\nFirst transmitted on BBC children's channel CBeebies on 9 February 2015, the 25 x 15-minute episodes are regularly repeated on CBeebies and featured on BBC iPlayer. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=775px\n|-\n|\n{{show\n|''List of episodes in series one''\n|\n*'''Episode 1: Spectacles''' \u2013 (Original Air Date: 9 February 2015)\n**Summary: Great Aunt Lizzie tells the story of Charlotte and the Adventure of the Expensive Spectacles: An artist in Imperial China with poor eyesight can't afford the spectacles he needs.

Producers, MacPherson and Parsons developed the format for the series, drawing inspiration from Bibby's real aunt whom he used to visit in Liverpool as a child.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brightons author Tony has got storytelling down to a tea|url=http://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/news/community/brightons-author-tony-has-got-storytelling-down-to-a-tea-1-3494677}}</ref>  The producers added the extra dimension of enchanting storytelling wrapped around a genuine historical artefact, with Plum Film's Production Executive Tina Foster, and Development Consultant Becky Lloyd both attached to the project from early development to series production. Series one and two are directed by Simon Hynd, with Morag McKinnon directing the Mayan episodes in series two. Digital Production Designer John Gosler, directed and hand painted the unique background artwork, with children's television writer Polly Churchill taking the role of Head Writer for both series, overseeing all 45 episodes.\n\nA key, addition to the team was Production Designer Leslie Dilley, a double [[Academy Award]] Winner for [[Star Wars]] and [[Raiders of the Lost Ark]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Leslie Dilley \u2013 Awards and Nominations|url=http://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/news/community/brightons-author-tony-has-got-storytelling-down-to-a-tea-1-3494677}}</ref>\n\n=== Museum involvement ===\nA key element of the show is its involvement with museums across the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. Plum Films consulted museums at key stages of production to ensure that the real artefacts that inspired Great Aunt Lizzie's stories reflected its core truths. Where possible, Plum Films representatives visited the museum to capture the dimensions and likeness of the object to be featured in the show. This aided the prop makers to replicate the prop, which would then be presented to each associated museum's curator for notes and approval. Similarly, script outlines were shared with each associated museum to give the all clear that the episode represented a satisfactory representation of their piece.<ref>{{cite web|title='Teacup Travels' \u2013 CBeebies series features our objects!|url=https://egyptmanchester.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/teacup-travels-cbbc-series-features-our-objects/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Artefacts which inspired children's TV show go on display at museum|url=http://www.durhamtimes.co.uk/lifestyle/11823247.Artefacts_which_inspired_children_s_TV_show_go_on_display_at_museum/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227203201/http://www.durhamtimes.co.uk/lifestyle/11823247.Artefacts_which_inspired_children_s_TV_show_go_on_display_at_museum/|archivedate=27 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Historic artefacts at Dumfries museum helps inspire a new TV hit 'Teacup Travels'|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/historic-artefacts-dumfries-museum-helps-5137987}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=775px\n|-\n|\n{{show\n|''List of associated museums''\n|\n*[[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]]\n*[[British Museum]]\n*[[British Optical Association Museum]]\n*[[The Dick Institute]]\n*[[Dumfries Museum]]\n*[[Durham University Oriental Museum]]\n*[[Fitzwilliam Museum]]\n*[[Inverness Museum and Art Gallery]]\n*[[Jorvik Viking Centre]]\n*[[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]]\n*[[Manchester Museum]]\n*[[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge]]\n*[[National Museum of Scotland]]\n*[[Norwich Castle]]\n*[[Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery]]\n*[[Royal Albert Memorial Museum]]\n*[[Stranraer Museum]]\n*[[Swansea Museum]]\n*[[Ulster Museum]]\n*[[Ure Museum of Greek Archaeology]]\n*[[The Victoria and Albert Museum]]\n* [http://www.whithorn.com/ The Whithorn Trust]\n}}\n|}\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe TV show is a combination of full live action for the prologue and epilogue scenes in Great Aunt Lizzie's house, and live action filmed against green screen then composited with colour saturated 2<sup>\u00bd</sup>d illustrated backgrounds for the story world.\n\n=== Locations ===\nFilmed entirely in Scotland, the sets were created in Loretto School, Musselburgh, while outdoor scenes featuring Great Aunt Lizzie's iconic cottage were filmed at the Head Gardener's Cottage in Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kids' show shines spotlight on Edinburgh|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/kids-show-shines-spotlight-on-edinburgh.118071955|website=The Herald|location=Glasgow}}</ref>\n\n=== Distribution (Non UK) ===\nThe first series of Teacup Travels was shown in Australia on ABC Kids in the summer of 2016.

Producers, MacPherson and Parsons developed the format for the series, drawing inspiration from Bibby's real aunt whom he used to visit in Liverpool as a child.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brightons author Tony has got storytelling down to a tea|url=http://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/news/community/brightons-author-tony-has-got-storytelling-down-to-a-tea-1-3494677}}</ref>  The producers added the extra dimension of enchanting storytelling wrapped around a genuine historical artefact, with Plum Film's Production Executive Tina Foster, and Development Consultant Becky Lloyd both attached to the project from early development to series production. Series one and two are directed by Simon Hynd, with Morag McKinnon directing the Mayan episodes in series two. Digital Production Designer John Gosler, directed and hand painted the unique background artwork, with children's television writer Polly Churchill taking the role of Head Writer for both series, overseeing all 45 episodes.\n\nA key, addition to the team was Production Designer Leslie Dilley, a double [[Academy Award]] Winner for [[Star Wars]] and [[Raiders of the Lost Ark]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Leslie Dilley \u2013 Awards and Nominations|url=http://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/news/community/brightons-author-tony-has-got-storytelling-down-to-a-tea-1-3494677}}</ref>\n\n=== Museum involvement ===\nA key element of the show is its involvement with museums across the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. Plum Films consulted museums at key stages of production to ensure that the real artefacts that inspired Great Aunt Lizzie's stories reflected its core truths.

This aided the prop makers to replicate the prop, which would then be presented to each associated museum's curator for notes and approval. Similarly, script outlines were shared with each associated museum to give the all clear that the episode represented a satisfactory representation of their piece.<ref>{{cite web|title='Teacup Travels' \u2013 CBeebies series features our objects!|url=https://egyptmanchester.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/teacup-travels-cbbc-series-features-our-objects/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Artefacts which inspired children's TV show go on display at museum|url=http://www.durhamtimes.co.uk/lifestyle/11823247.Artefacts_which_inspired_children_s_TV_show_go_on_display_at_museum/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227203201/http://www.durhamtimes.co.uk/lifestyle/11823247.Artefacts_which_inspired_children_s_TV_show_go_on_display_at_museum/|archivedate=27 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Historic artefacts at Dumfries museum helps inspire a new TV hit 'Teacup Travels'|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/historic-artefacts-dumfries-museum-helps-5137987}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=775px\n|-\n|\n{{show\n|''List of associated museums''\n|\n*[[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]]\n*[[British Museum]]\n*[[British Optical Association Museum]]\n*[[The Dick Institute]]\n*[[Dumfries Museum]]\n*[[Durham University Oriental Museum]]\n*[[Fitzwilliam Museum]]\n*[[Inverness Museum and Art Gallery]]\n*[[Jorvik Viking Centre]]\n*[[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]]\n*[[Manchester Museum]]\n*[[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge]]\n*[[National Museum of Scotland]]\n*[[Norwich Castle]]\n*[[Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery]]\n*[[Royal Albert Memorial Museum]]\n*[[Stranraer Museum]]\n*[[Swansea Museum]]\n*[[Ulster Museum]]\n*[[Ure Museum of Greek Archaeology]]\n*[[The Victoria and Albert Museum]]\n* [http://www.whithorn.com/ The Whithorn Trust]\n}}\n|}\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe TV show is a combination of full live action for the prologue and epilogue scenes in Great Aunt Lizzie's house, and live action filmed against green screen then composited with colour saturated 2<sup>\u00bd</sup>d illustrated backgrounds for the story world.\n\n=== Locations ===\nFilmed entirely in Scotland, the sets were created in Loretto School, Musselburgh, while outdoor scenes featuring Great Aunt Lizzie's iconic cottage were filmed at the Head Gardener's Cottage in Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kids' show shines spotlight on Edinburgh|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/kids-show-shines-spotlight-on-edinburgh.118071955|website=The Herald|location=Glasgow}}</ref>\n\n=== Distribution (Non UK) ===\nThe first series of Teacup Travels was shown in Australia on ABC Kids in the summer of 2016.
