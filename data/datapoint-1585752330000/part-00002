The question has sometimes been framed as,  \"As a Christian, how can you not want to convert us?\" his response is,  \"Of course I would love to see you become Christians, but I would never seek to convert you.\" He explains that as an Evangelical Christian he believes that Christians and Jews have specific roles in God's plan, and that he  personally has \"too much respect\" for the Jewish people to suggest that any Jew should become something else.<ref name=\"chic\">{{cite news |last1=Culwin |first1=Clifford |title=\"As a Christian, how can you not want to convert us?\" Stearns had clearly fielded this question before. \"Of course I would love to see you become Christians,\" he said, \"but I would never seek to convert you.\" He explained that Evangelicals view Christians and Jews alike as having a specific role in God's plan.
