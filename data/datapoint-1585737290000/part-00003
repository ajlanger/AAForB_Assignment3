In December 1947 the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] under [[Josef Stalin]], decreed that ''May 9th (Victory Day)'' would become a working day, effectively making the celebrations cancelled and ceased completely. Stalin was also not eager to see the maimed Red Army soldiers who fought victoriously during the war, parade on [[Red Square]], as he had no need for heroes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Stalin had many of the veterans removed from the city limits, and the removal of the holiday helped build his image of being the great commander and hero of the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|war]], effectively broadening his [[Cult of Personality]] during his reign of power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nHowever, on April 26, 1965, nearly twenty years after the [[Moscow Victory Parade of 1945|first parade]], under [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] reversed the actions made in 1947, thus making May 9 a non-working holiday, this would be the first time Victory Day was made as an actual holiday.

Ukrainians were the largest minority ethnic group of the USSR, and had seen the full force of the Nazi invasion that struck a huge blow to the Ukrainian population. An estimated 1,377,400 Ukrainian servicemen and women of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and personnel from paramilitary partisan formations lost their lives fighting against [[Wehrmacht]] troops during the war together with forces from fellow Axis nations and the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (which from late 1941 onwards had also fought against the Axis Powers' armed forces and paramilitaries) which they fought against bravely at a cost of millions of lives lost nationwide. Although Victory Day as a holiday has been altered completely and renamed as a completely different national holiday following the events of the 2013-14 [[Euromaidan]] (as [[Victory Day over Nazism in World War II]]), many Ukrainians still honor their forefathers in the traditional Victory Day style.{{according to whom|date=July 2018}} Only in the separatist-controlled regions of [[Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk]], since 2015, do the people completely celebrate the traditional Victory Day parades with military vehicles and soldiers marching past the main squares of the two cities, which are also televised events within their areas.\n\n'''Parades:'''\n*1995 Kiev Victory Day Parade\n*[[2010 Kiev Victory Day Parade]]\n*2011 Kiev Victory Day Parade\n*2013 Kiev Victory Day Parade<ref>http://www.unn.com.ua/uk/news/1463653-1-87</ref>\n\n===Republic of Belarus {{flagicon|BLR}}===\nVictory parades in [[Belarus]] have dated back to Soviet parades in the former [[Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

The traditions and customs of Victory Day are the same as in Russia, with marches of Immortal Regiments held in cities with large populations of Red Army veterans and their descendants, particularly in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Haifa]].\n\n== Expanded summary of the parades within the CIS ==\nAs Victory Day is the principal military holiday of Russia and of almost all member countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (except the Baltics and the Ukraine), the celebrations in [[Moscow]] and other capital cities thus serve as national events to mark such an important holiday for millions of people, marking the anniversary of the capitulation of Nazi Germany in 1945. The annual or semiannual parades mark the Allied victory in World War II on the Eastern Front, on the same day as the signing of the German act of capitulation to the victorious Allies in Berlin, at midnight of May 9, 1945 (Russian time), officially concluding the Second World War in Europe and northern parts of Africa.\n\n=== Red Square, Moscow ===\n{{Main|Moscow Victory Day Parade}}\n[[File:2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade 45.jpg|thumb|The [[2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade]]]]\nThe most important parade of those being held on May 9 is the one held on Moscow's [[Red Square]], with the [[President of Russia]] as the guest of honor and keynote speaker in virtue of his constitutional mandate as Supreme Commander of the [[Russian Armed Forces]].  On the morning of the day, an estimated 14,000 military personnel, including a regiment of female cadets and youth cadets, assemble by battalions on the square together with the Massed Bands of around 1,100 bandsmen under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the [[Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia]] (an appointment bestowed to either a colonel or a general rank officer), together with more than 210 vehicles and 3,800 vehicle crews assembled on Tverskaya Street just north of the [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow]], during the major parades a battalion or company of historical Red Army vehicles, estimated at around 36 vehicles and composed of just the [[T-34]], GAZ-67 and the SU-100 plus the optional BM-13N (or at around an estimated 480 when counting other vehicles of the war which would take part just like in the parades of 1985 and 1990) assemble on the street as well with modern military hardware of the Armed Forces and the National Guard (and optionally by the other uniformed organizations). At the air bases outside Moscow (in areas like [[Kubinka]]), more than 88 aircraft are assembled with their aircrews for the flypast segment. Each of the contingents, since 1996, carry historical military colors of the 1942 (Red Army, Soviet Air Force, People's Militia) and 1932/1944 (Navy) patterns at the head of their formations honoring the millions of men and women who served in the ranks of the military and law enforcement services of the former Soviet Union during the long period of the Eastern Front of the Second World War, and the millions among them who were either killed or were missing in action.\n\nThe celebrations begin at 9:55&nbsp;am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival of the President and the [[Prime Minister of Russia]] to a special grandstand in front of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]], where six of the past parades were reviewed by national leaders. They greet the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service commanders, deputy ministers in the Ministry of Defence and commanders of the support units within the Armed Forces, together with veterans, veterans' families and representatives of the Suvorov and Nakhimov Schools assembled. To the left and right of the grandstand are the stands wherein veterans, veterans' families and descendants and families of personnel killed in action are gathered. In between the grandstand to the south of the stands are two platoons of armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in the Imperial-styled military uniforms and some unarmed half-companies of the Kremlin Regiment, both of which would be later taking post to mark the distance of the troops marching past and to line the square's western side facing the Kremlin together with extra drum majors from the Band Service, which are there to coordinate the march past to be timed in with the music of the bands since the parade of 1995. At the square, the parade commander (usually a Colonel General or rarely a General of the Army with the billet of Commander of the Ground Forces or as the Deputy Chief of General Staff) takes his place in a special an Aurus Senat armored limousine (formerly a Zil until 2018), having just received the report on the readiness of the parade from the commandant of the Combined Arms Academy who is a general officer.\n\nAs the [[Spasskaya Tower]] of the [[Kremlin]] sounds the chimes at 10&nbsp;am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms as the 154th PICR's 1st Honor Guard Company Colour Guard, to the melody of ''[[The Sacred War]]'' being played by the Massed Bands, marches into the square and past the dignitaries with guard carrying both the [[Flag of Russia]] and the [[Victory Banner]]. As the colour guards approach the grandstand, the colour officers execute eyes left and resume above face after passing by. This is followed by the parade being commanded to stand at ease after the colours take their place at the northwest end of the square fronting the [[State Historical Museum]], besides the colour of the Armed Forces. Then the Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) is driven on the limousine to the center of the square nearest the tribune, the parade presenting arms again at this point. The parade commander informs him of the readiness of the parade to be inspected. The report is received, and to the tune of the Massed Bands the Minister and the parade commander are driven to inspect the parading contingents each together with the bands. As the limousines stop the Minister sends Victory Day greetings to each of the parading contingents, in which they respond with a threefold loud ''[[Oorah (Marines)|Oorah]]'' that is heard all over the grounds. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands strike up to ''[[Slavsya]]'' from [[A Life for the Tsar]] as the PC returns to his place, the Minister driven to the grandstand amidst louds shouts of ''Oorah'' by the parade contingents where he dismounts the limousine and the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's car led by the Commandant of the College and the college colour guard. The parade is ordered to stand at ease after the Minister informs the President that the parade is formed up for the march past in review and its inspection officially completed. In the 1965, 1985 and 1990 parades, the limousines would inspect the personnel of the mobile column at the Manezhnaya Square formed into battalions, in remembrance of the mounted inspection of the original 1945 parade, which included cavalry, [[tachanka]]s and [[horse artillery]] in addition to the huge mobile column. Following the report of the Minister of Defence, the keynote holiday address to the nation of the President follows, preceded by a fanfare by the Massed Bands, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare''. A moment of silence, since 2014, features as part of the keynote address.\n\nAs the president finishes the address and a threefold ''Oorah'' resounds all over the square by the entire parade assembled and the honor guard presents arms, the Massed Bands play the [[National Anthem of Russia]] and a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound Retreat as the honor guard executes order arms and the parade commander orders the parade to commence the march past in the following manner:\n\n::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''<br>''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''<br>''Slope.. arms!''\n\nAs the command is given to start the linemen take their places and the field markers also as well at the south end of the square. As the PC ends the commands with ''Eyes to the right, forward, quick march!'' the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, as is their tradition since 1938, march first to the tune of the  \"General Miloradovich\" by one of its late alumni, Lieutenant General [[Valery Khalilov]], one of the longest-serving Senior Directors of Music of the Military Band Service and conductor of the Moscow area massed bands from 2002 to 2016, being played by the drummers and fifers. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums stop playing by the signal of the Corps Drum Major and swings its drumsticks while on the eyes right. The Corps is followed by the colour guard of the 154th PICR and its 1st Honor Guard Company, during jubilee parades, the colour guard is followed by a company of colour bearers carrying the front standards in the order of their marchpast in the 1945 Victory Parade and their escorts, colours from the regiments, brigades and divisions which took part in the original 1945 parade and a historical unit of servicemen in period uniforms, optionally joined by the Kuban Cossacks, in memory of their contingent which marched past on that very parade, and the Escort Cavalry Squadron of the [[Kremlin Regiment]] plus a number of international contingents. This is followed by the rest of the parade ground column, starting with the youth contingents and by the Combined Arms Academy, among other troops.\n\nOnce the ground column ends, the bands stop playing and, to give way to the mobile column by marching towards the facade of the GUM department store. The mobile column starts with the drivepast of historical vehicles in jubilee years and only a T-34/85 medium battle tank carrying the Victory Banner non-special anniversary years. Following the end of the mobile column with the service flags of the three branches of the Armed Forces the flypast then follows, usually as the Bands play the ''Aviamarch'' and other air marches.

The traditions and customs of Victory Day are the same as in Russia, with marches of Immortal Regiments held in cities with large populations of Red Army veterans and their descendants, particularly in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Haifa]].\n\n== Expanded summary of the parades within the CIS ==\nAs Victory Day is the principal military holiday of Russia and of almost all member countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (except the Baltics and the Ukraine), the celebrations in [[Moscow]] and other capital cities thus serve as national events to mark such an important holiday for millions of people, marking the anniversary of the capitulation of Nazi Germany in 1945. The annual or semiannual parades mark the Allied victory in World War II on the Eastern Front, on the same day as the signing of the German act of capitulation to the victorious Allies in Berlin, at midnight of May 9, 1945 (Russian time), officially concluding the Second World War in Europe and northern parts of Africa.\n\n=== Red Square, Moscow ===\n{{Main|Moscow Victory Day Parade}}\n[[File:2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade 45.jpg|thumb|The [[2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade]]]]\nThe most important parade of those being held on May 9 is the one held on Moscow's [[Red Square]], with the [[President of Russia]] as the guest of honor and keynote speaker in virtue of his constitutional mandate as Supreme Commander of the [[Russian Armed Forces]].  On the morning of the day, an estimated 14,000 military personnel, including a regiment of female cadets and youth cadets, assemble by battalions on the square together with the Massed Bands of around 1,100 bandsmen under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the [[Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia]] (an appointment bestowed to either a colonel or a general rank officer), together with more than 210 vehicles and 3,800 vehicle crews assembled on Tverskaya Street just north of the [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow]], during the major parades a battalion or company of historical Red Army vehicles, estimated at around 36 vehicles and composed of just the [[T-34]], GAZ-67 and the SU-100 plus the optional BM-13N (or at around an estimated 480 when counting other vehicles of the war which would take part just like in the parades of 1985 and 1990) assemble on the street as well with modern military hardware of the Armed Forces and the National Guard (and optionally by the other uniformed organizations). At the air bases outside Moscow (in areas like [[Kubinka]]), more than 88 aircraft are assembled with their aircrews for the flypast segment. Each of the contingents, since 1996, carry historical military colors of the 1942 (Red Army, Soviet Air Force, People's Militia) and 1932/1944 (Navy) patterns at the head of their formations honoring the millions of men and women who served in the ranks of the military and law enforcement services of the former Soviet Union during the long period of the Eastern Front of the Second World War, and the millions among them who were either killed or were missing in action.\n\nThe celebrations begin at 9:55&nbsp;am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival of the President and the [[Prime Minister of Russia]] to a special grandstand in front of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]], where six of the past parades were reviewed by national leaders. They greet the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service commanders, deputy ministers in the Ministry of Defence and commanders of the support units within the Armed Forces, together with veterans, veterans' families and representatives of the Suvorov and Nakhimov Schools assembled. To the left and right of the grandstand are the stands wherein veterans, veterans' families and descendants and families of personnel killed in action are gathered. In between the grandstand to the south of the stands are two platoons of armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in the Imperial-styled military uniforms and some unarmed half-companies of the Kremlin Regiment, both of which would be later taking post to mark the distance of the troops marching past and to line the square's western side facing the Kremlin together with extra drum majors from the Band Service, which are there to coordinate the march past to be timed in with the music of the bands since the parade of 1995. At the square, the parade commander (usually a Colonel General or rarely a General of the Army with the billet of Commander of the Ground Forces or as the Deputy Chief of General Staff) takes his place in a special an Aurus Senat armored limousine (formerly a Zil until 2018), having just received the report on the readiness of the parade from the commandant of the Combined Arms Academy who is a general officer.\n\nAs the [[Spasskaya Tower]] of the [[Kremlin]] sounds the chimes at 10&nbsp;am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms as the 154th PICR's 1st Honor Guard Company Colour Guard, to the melody of ''[[The Sacred War]]'' being played by the Massed Bands, marches into the square and past the dignitaries with guard carrying both the [[Flag of Russia]] and the [[Victory Banner]]. As the colour guards approach the grandstand, the colour officers execute eyes left and resume above face after passing by. This is followed by the parade being commanded to stand at ease after the colours take their place at the northwest end of the square fronting the [[State Historical Museum]], besides the colour of the Armed Forces. Then the Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) is driven on the limousine to the center of the square nearest the tribune, the parade presenting arms again at this point. The parade commander informs him of the readiness of the parade to be inspected. The report is received, and to the tune of the Massed Bands the Minister and the parade commander are driven to inspect the parading contingents each together with the bands. As the limousines stop the Minister sends Victory Day greetings to each of the parading contingents, in which they respond with a threefold loud ''[[Oorah (Marines)|Oorah]]'' that is heard all over the grounds. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands strike up to ''[[Slavsya]]'' from [[A Life for the Tsar]] as the PC returns to his place, the Minister driven to the grandstand amidst louds shouts of ''Oorah'' by the parade contingents where he dismounts the limousine and the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's car led by the Commandant of the College and the college colour guard. The parade is ordered to stand at ease after the Minister informs the President that the parade is formed up for the march past in review and its inspection officially completed. In the 1965, 1985 and 1990 parades, the limousines would inspect the personnel of the mobile column at the Manezhnaya Square formed into battalions, in remembrance of the mounted inspection of the original 1945 parade, which included cavalry, [[tachanka]]s and [[horse artillery]] in addition to the huge mobile column. Following the report of the Minister of Defence, the keynote holiday address to the nation of the President follows, preceded by a fanfare by the Massed Bands, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare''. A moment of silence, since 2014, features as part of the keynote address.\n\nAs the president finishes the address and a threefold ''Oorah'' resounds all over the square by the entire parade assembled and the honor guard presents arms, the Massed Bands play the [[National Anthem of Russia]] and a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound Retreat as the honor guard executes order arms and the parade commander orders the parade to commence the march past in the following manner:\n\n::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''<br>''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''<br>''Slope.. arms!''\n\nAs the command is given to start the linemen take their places and the field markers also as well at the south end of the square. As the PC ends the commands with ''Eyes to the right, forward, quick march!'' the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, as is their tradition since 1938, march first to the tune of the  \"General Miloradovich\" by one of its late alumni, Lieutenant General [[Valery Khalilov]], one of the longest-serving Senior Directors of Music of the Military Band Service and conductor of the Moscow area massed bands from 2002 to 2016, being played by the drummers and fifers. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums stop playing by the signal of the Corps Drum Major and swings its drumsticks while on the eyes right. The Corps is followed by the colour guard of the 154th PICR and its 1st Honor Guard Company, during jubilee parades, the colour guard is followed by a company of colour bearers carrying the front standards in the order of their marchpast in the 1945 Victory Parade and their escorts, colours from the regiments, brigades and divisions which took part in the original 1945 parade and a historical unit of servicemen in period uniforms, optionally joined by the Kuban Cossacks, in memory of their contingent which marched past on that very parade, and the Escort Cavalry Squadron of the [[Kremlin Regiment]] plus a number of international contingents. This is followed by the rest of the parade ground column, starting with the youth contingents and by the Combined Arms Academy, among other troops.\n\nOnce the ground column ends, the bands stop playing and, to give way to the mobile column by marching towards the facade of the GUM department store. The mobile column starts with the drivepast of historical vehicles in jubilee years and only a T-34/85 medium battle tank carrying the Victory Banner non-special anniversary years. Following the end of the mobile column with the service flags of the three branches of the Armed Forces the flypast then follows, usually as the Bands play the ''Aviamarch'' and other air marches. The flypast marks the formal end the parade.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Russian parades held outside Moscow ===\n[[File:Orchestra of the St. Petersburg Garrison.jpg|thumb|The massed bands of the St. Petersburg Garrison during the parade in 2016]]\n[[File:Den' pobedi Syria 02.jpg|thumb|A parade at the Khmeimim Air Base in 2018.]]\nAs per tradition, 27 other Russian major cities ([[Sevastopol]] and [[Kerch]] in the disputed [[Crimea]] included) are expected to hold commemorative parades on that day (some of them including flypasts and fleet reviews during jubilee years), and joint civil-military parades are hosted by 50 other towns and cities nationwide.

The [[President of Belarus]] then arrives at the grandstand in front of the [[Minsk Hero City Obelisk]] to await the start of the parade before 10:00 in the morning.\n\nThe parade commander gives the order to begin the review of the Minsk Garrison by the Defence Minister of Belarus, the parade presenting arms at that juncture and the massed bands of the Minsk Garrison under the [[Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus]] beginning to play inspection music under the baton of the Senior Director of Music. Then as the limousines stop in front of the grandstand and the massed bands stop playing the Deputy Defense Minister of Belarus reports to the Defense Minister on the status of the parade. \n\nThe Defense Minister, having now been duly notified, then reviews the parading troops along the avenue in his vehicle, stopping a few times to send holiday greetings to a 4,000 strong ground column formation from the armed forces and other uniformed organizations while the massed bands play. As the defense minister concludes the inspection of the troops, he reports to the president on the readiness of the parade. A minute of silence then takes place, followed by a performance of the National Anthem of Belarus ([[My Belarusy]]) by the massed bands. The president then delivers an address to the nation and congratulates the citizens on the holiday.
