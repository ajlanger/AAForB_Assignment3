He was the second son of [[Hugh&nbsp;IV of Cyprus]], the first by his second wife Alice of Ibelin. He was also invested as titular [[Count of Tripoli]] when young, in 1346. He was the greatest King of Cyprus on a military basis, where he had great success. He was unable to complete many plans, due to internal disputes that culminated in his assassination at the hands of three of his own knights.\n\n==Early life and crowning==\nPeter was born in [[Nicosia]] in 1328. Hugh's heir apparent was his first born son, Guy, who had married [[Marie of Bourbon, Latin Empress|Marie of Bourbon]]. Guy died before his father, however; and though his son, also named Hugh, demanded the throne, Peter was crowned King of Cyprus by [[Guy of Ibelin, bishop of Limassol]] in the Cathedral of [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]] on 24 November 1359.{{sfn|Richard|1950|p=98\u2013133}}\n\nIn 1349 he traveled secretly to Europe with his brother John. This upset their father who sent ships to find his sons and bring them back. When they were brought back, he imprisoned them for leaving without his permission.\n\nUpon the expulsion of the Holy Roman Empire from Palestine a hundred years before, Cyprus became the stronghold of Christianity in the [[Middle East]]. Peter understood the importance of his kingdom, and believed that his mission was to fight Islam. He had ambitions to retake the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] to which the house of [[Lusignan]] yet pretended. Peter was crowned as titular [[King of Jerusalem]] in [[Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque|Saint Nicholas Cathedral]] in [[Famagusta]] on 5 April 1360, succeeding his father.\n[[File:Armoiries Chypre J\u00e9rusalem.svg|thumb|150px|coat-of-arms of Lusignan of Cyprus and Jerusalem]]\n\n==Marriages==\nSoon after 28 June 1342 he married Eschiva de Montfort (d. before 1350),{{sfn|Edbury|1991|p=146}} only daughter and heiress of Humphrey de Montfort (1305 &ndash; 24 June 1326), [[Officers of the Kingdom of Cyprus#Constable|Constable of Cyprus]] and titular Lord of [[Toron]], and Eschive d'Ibelin. Eschiva died before 1350 while Peter was still a teenager and the marriage was childless.\n\nIn 1353 he married [[Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Cyprus|Eleanor of Aragon-Gandia]] (1333 &ndash; 26 December 1416 in [[Barcelona]] and buried there),{{sfn|Hill|2010|p=308}} daughter of Pedro, Infante of Aragon, Conde de Ribagorza, Ampurias y Prades, [[Seneschal]] of [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]], and Jeanne de Foix (died before November 1358).<br> Eleanor was crowned Queen of Cyprus on 24 November 1358 and [[Queen consort of Jerusalem|Queen of Jerusalem]] on 5 April 1360.\n\nHis passion for his second wife was much remarked upon by chroniclers; the chronicle of Machairas tells us how Peter always slept with Eleanora's night-dress in his arms:\n\n:\"[S]o for the love which [King Peter] had promised that, wherever he was, he would take [Queen Eleanora's] shift to lay it at night in his arms when he slept, and he made his chamberlain always bring with him the queen's shift, and had him put it in his bed.\"{{sfn|Bolger|Serwint|2002|p=157}}\n\n==Children==\nHe had three children from his second marriage to Eleanor:\n*[[Peter II of Cyprus|Peter II of Lusignan]] (c. 1357\u20131382),{{sfn|Hill|2010|p=370}} succeeded him as King of Cyprus and Jerusalem\n*[[Mary/Mariette or Margaret of Lusignan]] (ca. 1360 &ndash; ca. 1397), once engaged to [[Carlo Visconti]] and married in 1385 to her cousin James/Jacques de Lusignan (d. 1395/1397), titular [[Count of Tripoli]], son of [[John of Lusignan]] and wife [[Alix d'Ibelin]], and had issue\n*[[Eschiva of Lusignan]] (d. before 1369), died young\nAs [[Peter II of Cyprus]] remained heirless, the crown of Cyprus was passed to his uncle [[James I of Cyprus]], son of [[Hugh IV of Cyprus]] and [[Alix of Ibelin]].\n\n==Wars against the Turks==\n[[File:Araldiz GEDA 26 076.png|thumb|Order of the Sword (1347)]]\nNeighboring Muslim powers were potentially a great threat to Cyprus, the last Christian Crusader stronghold on the mainland of the Near East having been wiped out with the [[Fall of Acre]] in 1291. At the moment a new Islamic power had recently come to the fore, but the expanding [[Ottomans]] had their eye fixed on what remained of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In addition, they were primarily a land power, and for the moment the remaining Latin Christian entities in the region could hold their own on the seas. Along with the [[Knights of Saint John]] (the Hospitallers) the kings of Cyprus were the main inheritors of the Crusading tradition. Peter founded the chivalric Order of the Sword in 1347, which was dedicated to the recovery of Jerusalem.{{sfn|Boulton|1987|p=241-249}}\n\nThe royal family were in fact the titular kings of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, who had fled to the island just off the coast of the Levant. Reduced as they were, this Crusader heritage continued in the form of sea-borne raids, and were remarkably successful given their limited resources.\n\nUnlike his father, Peter decided to embrace this tradition and began with in a raid on [[Korikos]], a fortified harbour in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]. His primary focus of activity was along the coast of [[Asia Minor]], since the Christian Armenians in Cilicia had strong relations with the Kingdom of Cyprus via marriage ties. In January 1360, the residents of Korikos sent their representatives to Cyprus to ask for protection, since their city was threatened by the Turks. Peter sent some of his men led by the knight Roberto de Luisignan. The Turks were unable to break the Cypriot siege of Korikos.\n\nThe siege of Korikos was seen as a threat by Muslim leaders of Asia Minor and they allied against Peter, planning to attack him on his home island. They attacked Cyprus with many ships but Peter obtained aid from the Knights of Saint John from Rhodes. Other help came from the Pope and even from pirates. In July 1361, Peter mustered a fleet of 120 ships. With his force, Peter attacked Asia Minor, continuing his policy of preemptive attacks. On 23 August 1361, Cypriot forces landed in Antalya and Peter conquered the city after a siege on 24 August 1361. After this victory, the remaining emirs of the region offered Peter an annual tribute. Peter accepted the offer and sent his flags, coats of arms and symbols to be raised in many cities of Asia Minor. He stayed in Antalya until 8 September 1361. Then he went to other cities, some of whose emirs knelt to him, gave him presents, keys to castles and many other gifts. He returned with his trophies to Cyprus on 22 September 1361.\n\nThe emir of Antalya, [[Beylik of Teke|Teke]], after he lost his city, took a large army and after many attacks tried to occupy his city. After hard fighting, Cypriots managed to keep the city and also to siege the guard in the region of Myrres.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\n==Tour of Europe==\nMeanwhile, King Peter still faced a serious problem of his recognition as holder of the throne of Cyprus, since his nephew Hugh, went to the Pope to ask for the throne with the support of the [[King of France]]. Since Peter had sent nobles as his representatives to the Pope to support him without result, he resolved to visit the Pope himself. At the end of October 1362, he left from [[Paphos]] to [[Rhodes]] and then to [[Venice]] and he was accepted there with honour. He went to [[Avignon]] and visited the Pope together with the claimant of the throne of Cyprus. Peter was recognised as King and Hugh agreed a high annual benefit, solving the problem.\n\nTaking advantage of his trip in Europe, he tried to convince powerful rulers to strengthen him by organizing a great crusade to liberate the [[Holy Land]] and the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] which belonged to him. That issue was discussed with the newly elected [[Pope]], after the death of the previous incumbent. For the same reason he travelled to the [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]]. During his visit in England the historical [[Banquet of the Five Kings]] took place.\n\nHe also visited some powerful cities like [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Prague]] and [[Krak\u00f3w|Cracow]], where he participated in a [[Congress of Krak\u00f3w|gathering of monarchs]] where guests of the Polish king were [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], King [[Louis I of Hungary]], King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]], [[Siemowit III of Masovia]], [[Bolko II of \u015awidnica]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolczyk]], [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]], [[Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania]], [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania]], [[Otto V, Duke of Bavaria]] and [[Louis VI the Roman]] . During the festivities in Krak\u00f3w King Peter achieved a feat of [[chivalry]] - he won the royal [[Tournament (medieval)]].  Also travelled on,  meeting several monarchs in [[London]], at the meeting of kings  of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Denmark]]. Everywhere he went he was accepted with honours and expensive presents, however he did not manage to persuade those monarchs to compete in a new Pan-European and Pan-Christian crusade in the [[Middle East]].\n\nMeanwhile, Cyprus was governed by Prince John, brother of Peter who remained as vice-King, and faced many problems, such as the epidemics of 1363, which killed many residents of Cyprus (one of them was Eschiva, Peter's sister). The Turks who heard that the Cypriot people were dying, began new raids and pillages on the island.  At the same time an episode between Cypriots and Genoese navies in Famagusta became a political issue and resulted in many fights and killings. Peter who happened to be in Genoa, negotiated and signed a treaty with the Genoese declaring what rights the Genoese colonists of Cyprus could have.\n\n==Alexandria Crusade==\n{{Main|Alexandrian Crusade}}\n\nHis father Hugh attempted to stop his desire to lead a new crusade and retake [[Jerusalem]], but upon his death Peter began his plans in earnest. He travelled through [[Europe]] attempting to garner support for his expeditions and on 11 October 1365 he led a mixed Cypriot and Western force of Crusaders (on 70 ships) to sack [[Alexandria]] (see [[Alexandrian Crusade]]). However, the European knights refused to follow him to attack [[Cairo]], and he was obliged to return to Cyprus, the only permanent result of his expedition being the enmity of the Sultan of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egypt]].  Reprisals followed against Christian merchants in Syria and Egypt, and [[Pope Urban V]] advised Peter to make peace with the Sultan after unsuccessfully attempting to raise support among the European monarchs.\n\n==Attacks on Lebanon and Syria==\nPeter continued his crusade, this time aiming to attack [[Beirut]]. However his military operations ended after intervention of the Venetians willing to offer Peter high compensations for his military preparations, in order to not attack [[Damascus]]. He crusaded and raided [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] in January 1366, before the terms of service of his European reinforcements could expire. He attempted to again raise a force in Europe in 1368, but was unsuccessful. Urban V again counseled peace, and Peter was compelled to join the Pope and the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] in making a peace treaty with Egypt.\n\nThe commerce with Middle East, benefited Cyprus a lot, and because of Peter, Famagusta was one of the richest cities in the Mediterranean during his time. Also some financier friends of Peter were rich tradesmen from Famagusta, who could influence him. But the Sultan could no longer tolerate the insult of the capture of Alexandria and could not accept a friendly arrangement with Peter. So the attack against Tripoli was a clear message to the Sultan; either he agreed a peace and could begin to trade, or he would suffer continued attacks. The sultan wanted to create a movement of distraction, so he strengthened the emirs of Asia Minor and assembled an army to attack Korikos. Peter reinforced the garrison in Korikos with fresh troops and they repulsed the Turkish attack. In May 1367, the garrison in Antalya revolted because of the delayed payment of their wages. Peter immediately sailed there and imposed order, decapitating the ring leaders of the revolt.\n\nAfter all of this it was finally agreed to make peace with the Sultan of Cairo, although it proved impossible to be signed. So in 1367 there were other attacks on the Syrian coast, recapture and pillaging of Tripoli and other cities across the Syrian coast. As [[Leontios Makhairas]] writes, the reason that Peter could not keep Tripoli was because the city did not have walls. Among the other cities pillaged by Cypriots was [[Latakia]]. So the peace with the sultan was difficult.\n\n==Finances==\nFor all of his trips around [[Europe]] and of the wars, he needed a lot of money. Despite the high state income he needed to gain even more money, thus he gave to Cypriot serfs the right to buy their freedoms. By this rule, many Cypriots were benefited. Another source of income were his raids on the Islamic Levant.\n\n==Death==\nWhile in [[Rome]], he received an appeal from the barons of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenia]], nominating him as King and imploring him to deliver their country. He returned to Cyprus, but was rapidly plunged into domestic troubles. Queen Eleanor had been unfaithful during his long absences in Europe, and he retaliated by tyrannizing her favorite nobles, alienating even his brothers. On 17 January 1369 he was [[assassinated]] by three of his own knights, in his own bed at the Palace of La Cava, [[Nicosia]].\n\nDespite the harshness that brought a premature end to his life, his knight-errantry and crusading zeal led him to be regarded as the epitome of [[chivalry]]. He was buried in the church of St. Dominic's of Nicosia, the traditional burial place of the Kings of Cyprus. He was succeeded by his son [[Peter II of Cyprus|Peter II]].\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2019}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

After hard fighting, Cypriots managed to keep the city and also to siege the guard in the region of Myrres.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\n==Tour of Europe==\nMeanwhile, King Peter still faced a serious problem of his recognition as holder of the throne of Cyprus, since his nephew Hugh, went to the Pope to ask for the throne with the support of the [[King of France]]. Since Peter had sent nobles as his representatives to the Pope to support him without result, he resolved to visit the Pope himself. At the end of October 1362, he left from [[Paphos]] to [[Rhodes]] and then to [[Venice]] and he was accepted there with honour. He went to [[Avignon]] and visited the Pope together with the claimant of the throne of Cyprus. Peter was recognised as King and Hugh agreed a high annual benefit, solving the problem.\n\nTaking advantage of his trip in Europe, he tried to convince powerful rulers to strengthen him by organizing a great crusade to liberate the [[Holy Land]] and the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] which belonged to him. That issue was discussed with the newly elected [[Pope]], after the death of the previous incumbent. For the same reason he travelled to the [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]]. During his visit in England the historical [[Banquet of the Five Kings]] took place.\n\nHe also visited some powerful cities like [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Prague]] and [[Krak\u00f3w|Cracow]], where he participated in a [[Congress of Krak\u00f3w|gathering of monarchs]] where guests of the Polish king were [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], King [[Louis I of Hungary]], King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]], [[Siemowit III of Masovia]], [[Bolko II of \u015awidnica]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolczyk]], [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]], [[Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania]], [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania]], [[Otto V, Duke of Bavaria]] and [[Louis VI the Roman]] . During the festivities in Krak\u00f3w King Peter achieved a feat of [[chivalry]] - he won the royal [[Tournament (medieval)]].  Also travelled on,  meeting several monarchs in [[London]], at the meeting of kings  of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Denmark]]. Everywhere he went he was accepted with honours and expensive presents, however he did not manage to persuade those monarchs to compete in a new Pan-European and Pan-Christian crusade in the [[Middle East]].\n\nMeanwhile, Cyprus was governed by Prince John, brother of Peter who remained as vice-King, and faced many problems, such as the epidemics of 1363, which killed many residents of Cyprus (one of them was Eschiva, Peter's sister). The Turks who heard that the Cypriot people were dying, began new raids and pillages on the island.  At the same time an episode between Cypriots and Genoese navies in Famagusta became a political issue and resulted in many fights and killings. Peter who happened to be in Genoa, negotiated and signed a treaty with the Genoese declaring what rights the Genoese colonists of Cyprus could have.\n\n==Alexandria Crusade==\n{{Main|Alexandrian Crusade}}\n\nHis father Hugh attempted to stop his desire to lead a new crusade and retake [[Jerusalem]], but upon his death Peter began his plans in earnest. He travelled through [[Europe]] attempting to garner support for his expeditions and on 11 October 1365 he led a mixed Cypriot and Western force of Crusaders (on 70 ships) to sack [[Alexandria]] (see [[Alexandrian Crusade]]). However, the European knights refused to follow him to attack [[Cairo]], and he was obliged to return to Cyprus, the only permanent result of his expedition being the enmity of the Sultan of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egypt]].  Reprisals followed against Christian merchants in Syria and Egypt, and [[Pope Urban V]] advised Peter to make peace with the Sultan after unsuccessfully attempting to raise support among the European monarchs.\n\n==Attacks on Lebanon and Syria==\nPeter continued his crusade, this time aiming to attack [[Beirut]]. However his military operations ended after intervention of the Venetians willing to offer Peter high compensations for his military preparations, in order to not attack [[Damascus]]. He crusaded and raided [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] in January 1366, before the terms of service of his European reinforcements could expire. He attempted to again raise a force in Europe in 1368, but was unsuccessful. Urban V again counseled peace, and Peter was compelled to join the Pope and the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] in making a peace treaty with Egypt.\n\nThe commerce with Middle East, benefited Cyprus a lot, and because of Peter, Famagusta was one of the richest cities in the Mediterranean during his time. Also some financier friends of Peter were rich tradesmen from Famagusta, who could influence him. But the Sultan could no longer tolerate the insult of the capture of Alexandria and could not accept a friendly arrangement with Peter. So the attack against Tripoli was a clear message to the Sultan; either he agreed a peace and could begin to trade, or he would suffer continued attacks. The sultan wanted to create a movement of distraction, so he strengthened the emirs of Asia Minor and assembled an army to attack Korikos. Peter reinforced the garrison in Korikos with fresh troops and they repulsed the Turkish attack. In May 1367, the garrison in Antalya revolted because of the delayed payment of their wages. Peter immediately sailed there and imposed order, decapitating the ring leaders of the revolt.\n\nAfter all of this it was finally agreed to make peace with the Sultan of Cairo, although it proved impossible to be signed. So in 1367 there were other attacks on the Syrian coast, recapture and pillaging of Tripoli and other cities across the Syrian coast. As [[Leontios Makhairas]] writes, the reason that Peter could not keep Tripoli was because the city did not have walls. Among the other cities pillaged by Cypriots was [[Latakia]]. So the peace with the sultan was difficult.\n\n==Finances==\nFor all of his trips around [[Europe]] and of the wars, he needed a lot of money. Despite the high state income he needed to gain even more money, thus he gave to Cypriot serfs the right to buy their freedoms. By this rule, many Cypriots were benefited. Another source of income were his raids on the Islamic Levant.\n\n==Death==\nWhile in [[Rome]], he received an appeal from the barons of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenia]], nominating him as King and imploring him to deliver their country. He returned to Cyprus, but was rapidly plunged into domestic troubles. Queen Eleanor had been unfaithful during his long absences in Europe, and he retaliated by tyrannizing her favorite nobles, alienating even his brothers. On 17 January 1369 he was [[assassinated]] by three of his own knights, in his own bed at the Palace of La Cava, [[Nicosia]].\n\nDespite the harshness that brought a premature end to his life, his knight-errantry and crusading zeal led him to be regarded as the epitome of [[chivalry]]. He was buried in the church of St. Dominic's of Nicosia, the traditional burial place of the Kings of Cyprus. He was succeeded by his son [[Peter II of Cyprus|Peter II]].\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2019}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
