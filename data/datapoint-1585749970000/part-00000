The son of [[Archduke Otto of Austria (1865\u20131906)|Archduke Otto of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]], Charles became [[heir presumptive]] of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] after his uncle [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated in 1914]]. In 1911, he married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]].\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 following the death of Franz Joseph. He made secret attempts to negotiate Austria-Hungary's exit from the [[World War I|First World War]] but was unsuccessful. Despite Charles' intention to preserve the empire by transforming it into a federal union, Austria-Hungary headed rapidly towards complete dissolution; [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] were proclaimed and [[First Hungarian Republic|Hungary]] declared to cease her monarchic ties to Austria by the end of October 1918. Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles \"renounced participation\" in state affairs, but did not abdicate. The [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed the following day, and in April 1919 he was formally dethroned by the Austrian Parliament and exiled to Switzerland.\n\nCharles spent the remaining years of his life attempting to restore the monarchy. He made two attempts to reclaim the Hungarian throne in 1921; both failed due to a lack of support from Hungary's [[Regent of Hungary|regent]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. Charles was exiled for a second time to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where he soon fell ill and died of [[respiratory failure]] in 1922.\n\n[[beatification|Beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2004, Charles is known to the [[Catholic Church]] as '''Blessed Karl of Austria'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emperorcharles.org |title=Blessed Karl of Austria |publisher=Emperorcharles.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Kaiser Karl I as a child.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Boy wearing a sailor suit|Charles as a child, c.1889]]\n\nCharles was born on 17 August 1887, in the Castle of [[Persenbeug-Gottsdorf|Persenbeug]], in [[Lower Austria]]. His parents were [[Archduke Otto Franz of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]]. At the time, his great-uncle [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] reigned as [[Emperor of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary]]. Upon the death of [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolph]] in 1889, the Emperor's brother, Archduke Karl Ludwig, was next in line to the Austro-Hungarian throne. However, his death in 1896 from typhoid made his eldest son, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the new [[heir presumptive]].\n\nArchduke Charles was reared a devout [[Catholic]]. He spent his early years wherever his father's regiment happened to be stationed; later on, he lived in [[Vienna]] and [[Reichenau an der Rax]]. He was privately educated, but, contrary to the custom ruling in the imperial family, he attended a public [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for the sake of demonstrations in scientific subjects. On the conclusion of his studies at the gymnasium, he entered the army, spending the years from 1906-08 as an officer chiefly in [[Prague]], where he studied [[Law]] and [[Political Science]] concurrently with his military duties.<ref name=eb>{{Cite EB1922 |last=Pribram |first=Alfred Francis | wstitle=Charles}}</ref>\n\nIn 1907, he was declared of age, and Prince Zdenko Lobkowitz was appointed as his chamberlain. During the next few years, he carried out his military duties in various [[Bohemia]]n garrison towns. Charles' relations with his great-uncle were not intimate, and those with his uncle Franz Ferdinand were not cordial, with the differences between their wives increasing the existing tension between them. For these reasons, Charles, up to the time of the assassination of his uncle in 1914, obtained no insight into affairs of state, but led the life of a prince not destined for a high political position.<ref name=eb/>\n\n== Marriage ==\n[[File:Hochzeit Erzh Karl und Zita Schwarzau 1911c.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Charles and Zita's wedding, {{nowr|21 October 1911}}]]\nIn 1911, Charles married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]]. They had met as children but did not see one another for almost ten years, as each pursued their education. In 1909, his [[Dragoon]] regiment was stationed at [[Brand\u00fds nad Labem-Star\u00e1 Boleslav|Brand\u00fds nad Labem]] in Bohemia, from where he visited his aunt at [[Franti\u0161kovy L\u00e1zn\u011b|Franzensbad]].<ref name = \"Beeche\">Beeche.</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nIt was during one of these visits that Charles and Zita became reacquainted.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|5}} Due to Franz Ferdinand's [[morganatic marriage]] in 1900, his children were excluded from the succession. As a result, the Emperor pressured Charles to marry. Zita not only shared Charles' devout Catholicism, but also an impeccable royal lineage.<ref name=\"Brook-Shepherd\">{{cite book|last=Brook-Shepherd|first=G.|date=1991|title=The Last Empress: The Life and Times of Zita of Austria-Hungary, 1892\u20131989|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780002158619}}</ref>{{rp|16}} Zita later recalled:\n\n{{quote|We were of course glad to meet again and became close friends. On my side feelings developed gradually over the next two years. He seemed to have made his mind up much more quickly, however, and became even more keen when, in the autumn of 1910, rumours spread about that I had got engaged to a distant Spanish relative, [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]].\n\nOn hearing this, the Archduke came down post haste from his regiment at Brandeis and sought out his [step]grandmother, [[Infanta Maria Theresa of Portugal|Archduchess Maria Theresa]], who was also my aunt and the natural confidante in such matters. He asked if the rumor was true and when told it was not, he replied, \"Well, I had better hurry in any case or she will get engaged to someone else.\"<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|8}}}}\n\nArchduke Charles traveled to Villa Pianore, the Italian winter residence of Zita's parents, and asked for her hand; on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{Rp|8}} Charles and Zita were married at the Bourbon-Parma castle of Schwarzau in Austria on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast.<ref name=\"Brook-Shepherd\"/>{{Rp|19}} Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]] was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children followed in the next decade.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\nCharles became heir presumptive after the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914, the event which precipitated [[World War I]]. Only at this time did the old Emperor take steps to initiate the heir-presumptive to his crown in affairs of state. But the outbreak of World War I interfered with this political education. Charles spent his time during the first phase of the war at headquarters at [[Cieszyn|Teschen]], but exercised no military influence.<ref name=eb/>\n\nCharles then became a ''[[List of Austrian field marshals|Feldmarschall]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In the spring of 1916, in connection with the offensive against Italy, he was entrusted with the command of the XX. Corps, whose affections the heir-presumptive to the throne won by his affability and friendliness. The offensive, after a successful start, soon came to a standstill. Shortly afterwards, Charles went to the eastern front as commander of an army operating against the [[Russian Empire|Russia]]ns and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]ns.<ref name=eb/>\n\n==Reign==\n\n[[File:Karloath.jpg|thumb|King Charles IV taking his [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|coronation oath]] at Holy Trinity Column outside [[Matthias Church]], [[Budapest]], 30 December 1916]]\n[[File:Karlfamily.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the recently crowned King Charles IV and [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma|Queen Zita]] with their son [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]]]]\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 after the death of his grand-uncle, Emperor Franz Joseph.  \nOn 2 December 1916, he assumed the title of Supreme Commander of the whole army, succeeding [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Friedrich]]. His coronation as King of Hungary occurred on 30 December. In 1917, Charles secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma]], an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary. However, the Allies insisted on Austrian recognition of Italian claims to territory and Charles refused, so no progress was made.<ref>David Stevenson, \"The failure of peace by negotiation in 1917.\" ''Historical Journal'' 34#1 (1991): 65-86.</ref> Foreign minister [[Ottokar Czernin|Graf Czernin]] was only interested in negotiating a general peace which would include Germany, Charles himself went much further in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace. When news of the overture leaked in April 1918, Charles denied involvement until French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] published letters signed by him.  This led to Czernin's resignation, forcing Austria-Hungary into an even more dependent position with respect to its seemingly wronged German ally.<ref>Edward P. Keleher, \"Emperor Karl and the Sixtus Affair: Politico-Nationalist Repercussions in the Reich German and Austro-German Camps, and the Disintegration of Habsburg Austria, 1916-1918.\" ''East European Quarterly'' 26.2 (1992): 163+.</ref>\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire was wracked by inner turmoil in the final years of the war, with much tension between ethnic groups. As part of his [[Fourteen Points]], U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the Empire allow for autonomy and self-determination of its peoples. In response, Charles agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament and allow for the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However, the ethnic groups fought for full autonomy as separate nations, as they were now determined to become independent from Vienna at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThe new foreign minister Baron [[Stephan Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz|Istvan Buri\u00e1n]] asked for an armistice 14 October based on the Fourteen Points, and two days later Charles issued a proclamation that radically changed the nature of the Austrian state. The Poles were granted full independence with the purpose of joining their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in a Polish state.  The rest of the Austrian lands were transformed into a federal union composed of four parts: German, Czech, South Slav, and Ukrainian.  Each of the four parts was to be governed by a federal council, and [[Trieste]] was to have a special status. However, United States Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] replied four days later that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, autonomy inside the Empire for the nationalities was no longer enough. In fact, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak provisional government]] had joined the Allies 14 October, and the South Slav national council declared an [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|independent South Slav state]] 29 October 1918.\n\n===Trialism and Croatia===\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Karl favored the creation of a third Croatian political entity in the Empire, in addition to Austria and Hungary. In his Croatian coronation oath in 1916, he recognized the union of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia]] with [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|Rijeka]]<ref name=\"Karlova zavjernica\">(Hrvatska) Krunidbena zavjernica Karla IV. hrvatskom Saboru 28. prosinca 1916.

One by one, the nationalities proclaimed their independence; even before the note the national councils had been acting more like provisional governments. Charles' political future became uncertain.  On 31 October, Hungary officially ended the [[personal union]] between Austria and Hungary. Nothing remained of Charles' realm except the predominantly German-speaking Danubian and Alpine provinces, and he was challenged even there by the [[German Austria]]n State Council. His last Austrian prime minister, [[Heinrich Lammasch]], advised him that he was in an impossible situation, and his best course was to temporarily give up his right to exercise sovereign power.\n\n== <span id=\"Proclamations\"></span>Proclamations of November 1918 ==\n[[File:Verzichtserkl\u00e4rung Karl I. 11.11.1918.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of 11 November 1918]]\nOn the day of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people's right to determine the form of the state and \"relinquish[ed] every participation in the administration of the State.\"<ref name=\"Duffy\">{{cite book|editor-last=Horne|editor-first=C.

On the same day, the Imperial Family left [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] and moved to Castle [[Eckartsau]], east of Vienna. On 13 November, following a visit with Hungarian magnates, Charles issued a similar proclamation\u2014the Eckartsau Proclamation\u2014for Hungary.\n\nAlthough it has widely been cited as an \"abdication\", the word itself was never used in either proclamation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gomb\u00e1s|first=I.|date=2002|title=Kings and Queens of Hungary, Princes of Transylvania|location=Budapest|publisher=Corvina|isbn=9789631347593}}</ref> Indeed, he deliberately avoided using the word ''abdication'' in the hope that the people of either Austria or Hungary would vote to recall him. Privately, Charles left no doubt that he believed himself to be the rightful emperor. He wrote to [[Friedrich Gustav Piffl]], the [[Archbishop of Vienna]]: \"I did not abdicate, and never will&nbsp;[...] I see my manifesto of 11 November as the equivalent to a cheque which a street thug has forced me to issue at gunpoint&nbsp;[...] I do not feel bound by it in any way whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"Scheidl\">{{cite news|last=Werner|first=H.

An uneasy truce-like situation ensued and persisted until 23 to 24 March 1919, when Charles left for Switzerland, escorted by the commander of the small British guard detachment at Eckartsau, Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward Lisle Strutt]].\n\nAs the imperial train left Austria on 24 March, Charles issued another proclamation in which he confirmed his claim of sovereignty, declaring that \"whatever the national assembly of German Austria has resolved with respect to these matters since 11 November is null and void for me and my House.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Portisch|first=H.|date=1989|title=\u00d6sterreich I: die untersch\u00e4tzte Republik|language=de|location=Vienna|publisher=Kremayr & Scheriau|isbn=9783218004855|page=117}}</ref> The newly established republican government of Austria was not aware of this \"Manifesto of [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]]\" at this time\u2014it had been dispatched only to King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] and to [[Pope Benedict XV]] through diplomatic channels\u2014and politicians in power were irritated by the Emperor's departure without explicit abdication.\n\nThe [[Austrian Parliament]] responded on 3 April with the [[Habsburg Law]], which dethroned and banished the Habsburgs. Charles was barred from ever returning to Austria. Other male Habsburgs could only return if they renounced all intentions of reclaiming the throne and accepted the status of ordinary citizens. Another law passed on the same day abolished all nobility in Austria. In Switzerland, Charles and his family briefly took residence at Castle Wartegg near [[Rorschach, Switzerland|Rorschach]] at [[Lake Constance]], and later moved to Ch\u00e2teau de [[Prangins]] at [[Lake Geneva]] on 20 May.\n\n==Attempts to reclaim throne of Hungary==\n{{main|Charles IV of Hungary's attempts to retake the throne}}\nEncouraged by Hungarian royalists (\"legitimists\"), Charles sought twice in 1921 to reclaim the throne of Hungary, but failed largely because Hungary's [[regent]], [[Admiral]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] (the last commander of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Imperial and Royal Navy]]), refused to support Charles' restoration. Horthy's action was declared \"treasonous\" by royalists. Critics suggest that Horthy's actions were more firmly grounded in political reality than those of Charles and his supporters. Indeed, [[Little Entente|neighbouring countries]] had threatened to invade Hungary if Charles tried to regain the throne. Later in 1921, the Hungarian parliament formally nullified the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], an act that effectively dethroned the Habsburgs.\n\n==Exile in Madeira, Portugal and death==\n[[File:Karl Grabmal Monte.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Charles I in Madeira]]\nAfter the second failed attempt at restoration in Hungary, Charles and his pregnant wife Zita were arrested and quarantined at [[Tihany Abbey]].

In the interwar years he was celebrated in Austria as a military hero. When Nazi Germany took over it made his memory into that of a traitor. For decades after 1945, both popular interest and academic interest in the 1914\u20131918 war practically disappeared. Attention has slowly returned.<ref>Hannes Leidinger, \" Historiography 1918-Today (Austria-Hungary)\" ''International encyclopedia of the First World War'' (Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, 2017)   DOI: 10.15463/ie1418.10326</ref>\n\nHelmut Rumpler, the head of the Habsburg commission of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]], described Charles as \"a dilettante, far too weak for the challenges facing him, out of his depth, and not really a politician.\"<ref>see [https://www.dw.com/en/historians-question-the-beatification-of-blessed-charles/a-1092974 online]</ref> Others have seen Charles as a brave and honourable figure who tried to stop the war in which his Empire was doing so poorly. The English [[Neo-Jacobite Revival|Neo-Jacobite]] writer, [[Herbert Vivian]], wrote: <blockquote>Karl was a great leader, a Prince of peace, who wanted to save the world from a year of war; a statesman with ideas to save his people from the complicated problems of his Empire; a King who loved his people, a fearless man, a noble soul, distinguished, a saint from whose grave blessings come.<ref>* {{cite book |last=Vivian |first=Herbert |title=The Life of the Emperor Charles of Austria |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3jUAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Grayson and Grayson |date=1932 |oclc=10030055}}</ref></blockquote> [[Anatole France]], the French novelist, stated: <blockquote>Emperor Karl is the only decent man to come out of the war in a leadership position, no one listened to him. He sincerely wanted peace, and therefore was despised by the whole world.

The son of [[Archduke Otto of Austria (1865\u20131906)|Archduke Otto of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]], Charles became [[heir presumptive]] of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] after his uncle [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated in 1914]]. In 1911, he married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]].\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 following the death of Franz Joseph. He made secret attempts to negotiate Austria-Hungary's exit from the [[World War I|First World War]] but was unsuccessful. Despite Charles' intention to preserve the empire by transforming it into a federal union, Austria-Hungary headed rapidly towards complete dissolution; [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] were proclaimed and [[First Hungarian Republic|Hungary]] declared to cease her monarchic ties to Austria by the end of October 1918. Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles \"renounced participation\" in state affairs, but did not abdicate. The [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed the following day, and in April 1919 he was formally dethroned by the Austrian Parliament and exiled to Switzerland.\n\nCharles spent the remaining years of his life attempting to restore the monarchy. He made two attempts to reclaim the Hungarian throne in 1921; both failed due to a lack of support from Hungary's [[Regent of Hungary|regent]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. Charles was exiled for a second time to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where he soon fell ill and died of [[respiratory failure]] in 1922.\n\n[[beatification|Beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2004, Charles is known to the [[Catholic Church]] as '''Blessed Karl of Austria'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emperorcharles.org |title=Blessed Karl of Austria |publisher=Emperorcharles.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Kaiser Karl I as a child.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Boy wearing a sailor suit|Charles as a child, c.1889]]\n\nCharles was born on 17 August 1887, in the Castle of [[Persenbeug-Gottsdorf|Persenbeug]], in [[Lower Austria]]. His parents were [[Archduke Otto Franz of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]]. At the time, his great-uncle [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] reigned as [[Emperor of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary]]. Upon the death of [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolph]] in 1889, the Emperor's brother, Archduke Karl Ludwig, was next in line to the Austro-Hungarian throne. However, his death in 1896 from typhoid made his eldest son, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the new [[heir presumptive]].\n\nArchduke Charles was reared a devout [[Catholic]]. He spent his early years wherever his father's regiment happened to be stationed; later on, he lived in [[Vienna]] and [[Reichenau an der Rax]]. He was privately educated, but, contrary to the custom ruling in the imperial family, he attended a public [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for the sake of demonstrations in scientific subjects. On the conclusion of his studies at the gymnasium, he entered the army, spending the years from 1906-08 as an officer chiefly in [[Prague]], where he studied [[Law]] and [[Political Science]] concurrently with his military duties.<ref name=eb>{{Cite EB1922 |last=Pribram |first=Alfred Francis | wstitle=Charles}}</ref>\n\nIn 1907, he was declared of age, and Prince Zdenko Lobkowitz was appointed as his chamberlain. During the next few years, he carried out his military duties in various [[Bohemia]]n garrison towns. Charles' relations with his great-uncle were not intimate, and those with his uncle Franz Ferdinand were not cordial, with the differences between their wives increasing the existing tension between them. For these reasons, Charles, up to the time of the assassination of his uncle in 1914, obtained no insight into affairs of state, but led the life of a prince not destined for a high political position.<ref name=eb/>\n\n== Marriage ==\n[[File:Hochzeit Erzh Karl und Zita Schwarzau 1911c.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Charles and Zita's wedding, {{nowr|21 October 1911}}]]\nIn 1911, Charles married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]]. They had met as children but did not see one another for almost ten years, as each pursued their education. In 1909, his [[Dragoon]] regiment was stationed at [[Brand\u00fds nad Labem-Star\u00e1 Boleslav|Brand\u00fds nad Labem]] in Bohemia, from where he visited his aunt at [[Franti\u0161kovy L\u00e1zn\u011b|Franzensbad]].<ref name = \"Beeche\">Beeche.</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nIt was during one of these visits that Charles and Zita became reacquainted.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|5}} Due to Franz Ferdinand's [[morganatic marriage]] in 1900, his children were excluded from the succession. As a result, the Emperor pressured Charles to marry. Zita not only shared Charles' devout Catholicism, but also an impeccable royal lineage.<ref name=\"Brook-Shepherd\">{{cite book|last=Brook-Shepherd|first=G.|date=1991|title=The Last Empress: The Life and Times of Zita of Austria-Hungary, 1892\u20131989|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780002158619}}</ref>{{rp|16}} Zita later recalled:\n\n{{quote|We were of course glad to meet again and became close friends. On my side feelings developed gradually over the next two years. He seemed to have made his mind up much more quickly, however, and became even more keen when, in the autumn of 1910, rumours spread about that I had got engaged to a distant Spanish relative, [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]].\n\nOn hearing this, the Archduke came down post haste from his regiment at Brandeis and sought out his [step]grandmother, [[Infanta Maria Theresa of Portugal|Archduchess Maria Theresa]], who was also my aunt and the natural confidante in such matters. He asked if the rumor was true and when told it was not, he replied, \"Well, I had better hurry in any case or she will get engaged to someone else.\"<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|8}}}}\n\nArchduke Charles traveled to Villa Pianore, the Italian winter residence of Zita's parents, and asked for her hand; on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{Rp|8}} Charles and Zita were married at the Bourbon-Parma castle of Schwarzau in Austria on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast.<ref name=\"Brook-Shepherd\"/>{{Rp|19}} Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]] was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children followed in the next decade.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\nCharles became heir presumptive after the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914, the event which precipitated [[World War I]]. Only at this time did the old Emperor take steps to initiate the heir-presumptive to his crown in affairs of state. But the outbreak of World War I interfered with this political education. Charles spent his time during the first phase of the war at headquarters at [[Cieszyn|Teschen]], but exercised no military influence.<ref name=eb/>\n\nCharles then became a ''[[List of Austrian field marshals|Feldmarschall]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In the spring of 1916, in connection with the offensive against Italy, he was entrusted with the command of the XX. Corps, whose affections the heir-presumptive to the throne won by his affability and friendliness. The offensive, after a successful start, soon came to a standstill. Shortly afterwards, Charles went to the eastern front as commander of an army operating against the [[Russian Empire|Russia]]ns and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]ns.<ref name=eb/>\n\n==Reign==\n\n[[File:Karloath.jpg|thumb|King Charles IV taking his [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|coronation oath]] at Holy Trinity Column outside [[Matthias Church]], [[Budapest]], 30 December 1916]]\n[[File:Karlfamily.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the recently crowned King Charles IV and [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma|Queen Zita]] with their son [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]]]]\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 after the death of his grand-uncle, Emperor Franz Joseph.  \nOn 2 December 1916, he assumed the title of Supreme Commander of the whole army, succeeding [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Friedrich]]. His coronation as King of Hungary occurred on 30 December. In 1917, Charles secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma]], an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary. However, the Allies insisted on Austrian recognition of Italian claims to territory and Charles refused, so no progress was made.<ref>David Stevenson, \"The failure of peace by negotiation in 1917.\" ''Historical Journal'' 34#1 (1991): 65-86.</ref> Foreign minister [[Ottokar Czernin|Graf Czernin]] was only interested in negotiating a general peace which would include Germany, Charles himself went much further in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace. When news of the overture leaked in April 1918, Charles denied involvement until French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] published letters signed by him.  This led to Czernin's resignation, forcing Austria-Hungary into an even more dependent position with respect to its seemingly wronged German ally.<ref>Edward P. Keleher, \"Emperor Karl and the Sixtus Affair: Politico-Nationalist Repercussions in the Reich German and Austro-German Camps, and the Disintegration of Habsburg Austria, 1916-1918.\" ''East European Quarterly'' 26.2 (1992): 163+.</ref>\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire was wracked by inner turmoil in the final years of the war, with much tension between ethnic groups. As part of his [[Fourteen Points]], U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the Empire allow for autonomy and self-determination of its peoples. In response, Charles agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament and allow for the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However, the ethnic groups fought for full autonomy as separate nations, as they were now determined to become independent from Vienna at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThe new foreign minister Baron [[Stephan Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz|Istvan Buri\u00e1n]] asked for an armistice 14 October based on the Fourteen Points, and two days later Charles issued a proclamation that radically changed the nature of the Austrian state. The Poles were granted full independence with the purpose of joining their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in a Polish state.  The rest of the Austrian lands were transformed into a federal union composed of four parts: German, Czech, South Slav, and Ukrainian.  Each of the four parts was to be governed by a federal council, and [[Trieste]] was to have a special status. However, United States Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] replied four days later that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, autonomy inside the Empire for the nationalities was no longer enough. In fact, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak provisional government]] had joined the Allies 14 October, and the South Slav national council declared an [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|independent South Slav state]] 29 October 1918.\n\n===Trialism and Croatia===\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Karl favored the creation of a third Croatian political entity in the Empire, in addition to Austria and Hungary. In his Croatian coronation oath in 1916, he recognized the union of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia]] with [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|Rijeka]]<ref name=\"Karlova zavjernica\">(Hrvatska) Krunidbena zavjernica Karla IV. hrvatskom Saboru 28. prosinca 1916.

One by one, the nationalities proclaimed their independence; even before the note the national councils had been acting more like provisional governments. Charles' political future became uncertain.  On 31 October, Hungary officially ended the [[personal union]] between Austria and Hungary. Nothing remained of Charles' realm except the predominantly German-speaking Danubian and Alpine provinces, and he was challenged even there by the [[German Austria]]n State Council. His last Austrian prime minister, [[Heinrich Lammasch]], advised him that he was in an impossible situation, and his best course was to temporarily give up his right to exercise sovereign power.\n\n== <span id=\"Proclamations\"></span>Proclamations of November 1918 ==\n[[File:Verzichtserkl\u00e4rung Karl I. 11.11.1918.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of 11 November 1918]]\nOn the day of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people's right to determine the form of the state and \"relinquish[ed] every participation in the administration of the State.\"<ref name=\"Duffy\">{{cite book|editor-last=Horne|editor-first=C.

On the same day, the Imperial Family left [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] and moved to Castle [[Eckartsau]], east of Vienna.

An uneasy truce-like situation ensued and persisted until 23 to 24 March 1919, when Charles left for Switzerland, escorted by the commander of the small British guard detachment at Eckartsau, Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward Lisle Strutt]].\n\nAs the imperial train left Austria on 24 March, Charles issued another proclamation in which he confirmed his claim of sovereignty, declaring that \"whatever the national assembly of German Austria has resolved with respect to these matters since 11 November is null and void for me and my House.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Portisch|first=H.|date=1989|title=\u00d6sterreich I: die untersch\u00e4tzte Republik|language=de|location=Vienna|publisher=Kremayr & Scheriau|isbn=9783218004855|page=117}}</ref> The newly established republican government of Austria was not aware of this \"Manifesto of [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]]\" at this time\u2014it had been dispatched only to King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] and to [[Pope Benedict XV]] through diplomatic channels\u2014and politicians in power were irritated by the Emperor's departure without explicit abdication.\n\nThe [[Austrian Parliament]] responded on 3 April with the [[Habsburg Law]], which dethroned and banished the Habsburgs. Charles was barred from ever returning to Austria. Other male Habsburgs could only return if they renounced all intentions of reclaiming the throne and accepted the status of ordinary citizens. Another law passed on the same day abolished all nobility in Austria. In Switzerland, Charles and his family briefly took residence at Castle Wartegg near [[Rorschach, Switzerland|Rorschach]] at [[Lake Constance]], and later moved to Ch\u00e2teau de [[Prangins]] at [[Lake Geneva]] on 20 May.\n\n==Attempts to reclaim throne of Hungary==\n{{main|Charles IV of Hungary's attempts to retake the throne}}\nEncouraged by Hungarian royalists (\"legitimists\"), Charles sought twice in 1921 to reclaim the throne of Hungary, but failed largely because Hungary's [[regent]], [[Admiral]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] (the last commander of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Imperial and Royal Navy]]), refused to support Charles' restoration. Horthy's action was declared \"treasonous\" by royalists. Critics suggest that Horthy's actions were more firmly grounded in political reality than those of Charles and his supporters. Indeed, [[Little Entente|neighbouring countries]] had threatened to invade Hungary if Charles tried to regain the throne. Later in 1921, the Hungarian parliament formally nullified the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], an act that effectively dethroned the Habsburgs.\n\n==Exile in Madeira, Portugal and death==\n[[File:Karl Grabmal Monte.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Charles I in Madeira]]\nAfter the second failed attempt at restoration in Hungary, Charles and his pregnant wife Zita were arrested and quarantined at [[Tihany Abbey]].
