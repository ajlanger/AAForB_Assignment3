The city of [[Ajmer]] is the district headquarters.\n\nAjmer District has an area of 8,481&nbsp;km\u00b2, and a population of 2,583,052 (2011 census). Three main religions are; Hindu 1,869,044, Muslim 244,341, Jains 47,812. The district is situated in the center of Rajasthan, and is bounded by [[Nagaur District]] to the north, [[Jaipur District|Jaipur]] and [[Tonk District|Tonk]] districts to the east, [[Bhilwara District]] to the south, and [[Pali District]] to the west.\n\n== Ajmer geography ==\nThe eastern portion of the district is generally flat, broken only by gentle undulations. The western parts, from north-west to south-west, are intersected by the [[Aravalli Range]].  Many of the valleys in this region are sandy deserts, part of India's [[Thar Desert]], with an occasional oasis of cultivation. Some fertile tracts are also present; among these is the plain on which lies the town of Ajmer. This valley has an artificial lake, and is protected by the massive walls of the Nagpathar range or Serpent rock, which forms a barrier against the sand.  The only hills in the district are the [[Aravalli Range]] and its offshoots. Ajmer is almost totally devoid of rivers. The [[Banas River]] touches the south-eastern boundary of the district so as to irrigate the pargana of Samur. Four small streams\u2014the Sagarmati, Saraswati, Khari and Dai\u2014also intersect the district.  \n\nThe district is divided into four subdivisions, Ajmer, [[Beawar]], [[Kekri]] and [[Kishangarh]], and further subdivided into nine [[tehsil]]s, Ajmer, Beawar, Bhinai, Sarwar, Pisangan, Tantoti, [[Nasirabad, Ajmer|Nasirabad]], [[Masuda]], Kekri, Kishangarh.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Ajmer district has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 2,583,052.<ref name=districtcensus>{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title
