Eighty to ninety percent of participants, choosing from two options, chose that it was more likely for Linda to be a feminist ''and'' a bank teller than only a bank teller.

The scarcer an object or event is, the more value that thing holds. The abundance is the indicator of the value. is a     mental shortcut that places a value on an item based on how easily it might be lost, especially to competitors. The scarcity heuristic stems from the idea that the more difficult it is to acquire an item the more value that item has.

Cognitive maps are internal representations of our physical environment, particularly associated with spatial relationships. These internal representations of our environment are used by our memory as a guide in our external environment. It was found that when questioned about maps imaging, distancing, etc., people commonly made distortions to images. These distortions took shape in the regularization of images (i.e., images are represented as more like pure abstract geometric images, though they are irregular in shape).\n\nThere are several ways that humans form and use cognitive maps. Visual intake is a key part of mapping. The first is by using ''landmarks''. This is where a person uses a mental image to estimate a relationship, usually distance, between two objects. The second is ''route-road'' knowledge, and is generally developed after a person has performed a task and is relaying the information of that task to another person. The third is a ''survey''. A person estimates a distance based on a mental image that, to them, might appear like an actual map. This image is generally created when a person's brain begins making image corrections. These are presented in five ways:\n\n# ''Right-angle bias'': when a person straightens out an image, like mapping an intersection, and begins to give everything 90-degree angles, when in reality it may not be that way. \n# ''Symmetry heuristic'': when people tend to think of shapes, or buildings, as being more symmetrical than they really are. \n# ''Rotation heuristic'': when a person takes a naturally (realistically) distorted image and straightens it out for their mental image. \n# ''Alignment heuristic'': similar to the previous, where people align objects mentally to make them straighter than they really are.\n# ''Relative-position heuristic'': people do not accurately distance landmarks in their mental image based on how well they remember that particular item.\n\nAnother method of creating cognitive maps is by means of auditory intake based on verbal descriptions. Using the mapping based from a person's visual intake, another person can create a mental image, such as directions to a certain location.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-111-34476-4|pages=310\u20131315|edition=6th|author2=Karin Sternberg}}</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\"Heuristic device\" is used when an entity X exists to enable understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity Y. A good example is a [[Physical model|model]] that, as [[Map/territory relation|it is never identical with what it models]], is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models. Stories, metaphors, etc., can also be termed heuristic in that sense. A classic example is the notion of [[utopia]] as described in [[Plato]]'s best-known work, ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]''. This means that the \"ideal city\" as depicted in ''The Republic'' is not given as something to be pursued, or to present an orientation-point for development; rather, it shows how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another (often with highly problematic results), if one opted for certain principles and carried them through rigorously.\n\n\"Heuristic\" is also often used as a [[noun]] to describe a [[Rule of thumb|rule-of-thumb]], procedure, or method.<ref>[[Katarzyna Jaszczolt|K.

(2007). ''Heuristics and the Law'', Cambridge, The MIT Press, {{ISBN|978-0-262-07275-5}}</ref>\n\nThe present securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons.\nIn truth, actual investors face cognitive  limitations from biases, heuristics, and framing effects.\n\nFor instance, in all states in the [[United States]] the [[legal drinking age]] for unsupervised persons is 21 years, because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption. However, assuming people mature at different rates, the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others. In this case, the somewhat arbitrary deadline is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether an individual is sufficiently mature for society to trust them with that kind of responsibility. Some proposed changes, however, have included the completion of an alcohol education course rather than the attainment of 21 years of age as the criterion for legal alcohol possession. This would put youth alcohol policy more on a case-by-case basis and less on a heuristic one, since the completion of such a course would presumably be voluntary and not uniform across the population.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to [[patent law]]. [[Patent]]s are justified on the grounds that inventors must be protected so they have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that it is in society's best interest that inventors receive a temporary government-granted [[monopoly]] on their idea, so that they can recoup investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period. In the United States, the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the patent application was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking-age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product to be efficient. A 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including [[University of North Dakota]] law professor Eric E. Johnson, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries \u2013 such as [[software patent]]s \u2013 should be protected for different lengths of time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = Eric E. | year = 2006 | title = Calibrating Patent Lifetimes | url = http://www.eejlaw.com/writings/Johnson_Calibrating_Patent_Lifetimes.pdf | journal = Santa Clara Computer & High Technology Law Journal | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 269\u2013314 }}</ref>\n\n== Stereotyping ==\n\nStereotyping is a type of heuristic that people use to form opinions or make judgments about things they have never seen or experienced.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bodenhausen|first1=Galen V.|title=\"On the Dialectics of Discrimination: Dual Processes in Social Stereotyping\", in Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology edited by Shelly Chaiken and Yaacov Trope|date=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|location=NY|isbn=978-1572304215|pages=271\u201392|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5X_auIBx99EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015|display-authors=etal}}</ref> They work as a mental shortcut to assess everything from the social status of a person (based on their actions),<ref name=\":0\" /> to whether a plant is a tree based on the assumption that it is tall, has a trunk, and has leaves (even though the person making the evaluation might never have seen that particular type of tree before).\n\nStereotypes, as first described by journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] in his book ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]'' (1922), are the pictures we have in our heads that are built around experiences as well as what we are told about the world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kleg|first1=Milton|title=Hate Prejudice and Racism|date=1883|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791415368|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aaMuQHO04I0C&pg=PA135&dq=stereotypes+lippmann+pictures+head#v=onepage&q=stereotypes%20lippmann%20pictures%20head&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=G\u00f6k\u00e7en|first1=Sinan|title=Pictures in Our Heads|url=http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2868|website=European Roma Rights Centre|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Artificial intelligence ==\nA [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] can be used in artificial intelligence systems while searching a solution space.

This leads people to avoid others that are viewed as \u201ccontaminated\u201d to the observer. This happens due     to the fact of the observer viewing something that is seen as bad or to seek objects that have been associate with what seems good. Somethings one can view as harmful can tend not to really be. This sometimes leads to irrational thinking on behalf of the observer. \n*[[Effort heuristic]] -  the worth of an object is determined by the amount of effort put into the production of the object. Objects that took longer to produce are more  valuable while the objects that took less time are deemed not as valuable. Also applies to how much effort is put into achieving the product. This can be seen as the difference of working and earning the object versus  finding the object on the side of the street. It can be the same object but the one found will not be deemed as valuable as the one that we earned. \n*[[Escalation of commitment]] \u2013 Describes the phenomenon where people justify increased investment in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, starting today, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit.

Usually not every event is seen as complete but what was felt at the     climax whether the event was pleasant or unpleasant to the observer.\u00a0 All other feelings is not lost but is not used. This can also include how long the event happened. \n*[[Representativeness heuristic]] \u2013 A mental shortcut used when making judgments about the probability of an event under uncertainty.   Or, judging a situation based on how similar the prospects are to the prototypes the person holds in his or her mind. For example, in a 1982 Tversky and Kahneman experiment, participants were given a description of a woman named Linda.  Based on the description, it was likely that Linda was a feminist.  Eighty to ninety percent of participants, choosing from two options, chose that it was more likely for Linda to be a feminist ''and'' a bank teller than only a bank teller.  The likelihood of two events cannot be greater than that of either of the two events individually. For this reason, the representativeness heuristic is exemplary of the [[conjunction fallacy]].<ref name=\"Harvey, N. 2007\"/>\n*[[Scarcity heuristic]] - works as the same as the economy. The scarcer an object or event is, the more value that thing holds. The abundance is the indicator of the value. is a     mental shortcut that places a value on an item based on how easily it might be lost, especially to competitors. The scarcity heuristic stems from the idea that the more difficult it is to acquire an item the more value that item has. In many situations we use an item\u2019s availability, its perceived abundance, to quickly estimate quality and/or utility. This can lead to systemic errors or [[cognitive bias]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lynn|first=Michael|date=March 1992|title=The Psychology of Unavailability: Explaining Scarcity and Cost Effects on Value|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15324834basp1301_2|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3\u20137|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1301_2|issn=0197-3533}}</ref>\n*[[Simulation heuristic]] - simplified mental strategy in which people determine the likelihood of an event happening based on how easy it is to mentally picture the event happening. People regret the events that are easier to image over the ones that would be harder to. It is also thought that people will use this heuristic to predict the likelihood of another's behavior happening. This shows that people are constantly simulating everything around them in order to be able to predict the likelihood of events around them. It is believe that people do this by mentally undoing events that they have experienced and then running mental simulations of the events with the corresponding input values of the altered model.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|date=1981-05-15|title=Variants of Uncertainty|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.21236/ada099503|location=Fort Belvoir, VA}}</ref>\n*[[Social proof]]\n\n=== Formal models of heuristics ===\n\n*[[Fast-and-frugal trees]]\n*[[Fluency heuristic]]\n*[[Gaze heuristic]]\n*[[Recognition heuristic]]\n*[[Satisficing]]\n*[[Similarity heuristic]]\n*[[Take-the-best heuristic]]\n\n=== Cognitive maps ===\nHeuristics were also found to be used in the manipulation and creation of [[cognitive maps]]. Cognitive maps are internal representations of our physical environment, particularly associated with spatial relationships. These internal representations of our environment are used by our memory as a guide in our external environment. It was found that when questioned about maps imaging, distancing, etc., people commonly made distortions to images. These distortions took shape in the regularization of images (i.e., images are represented as more like pure abstract geometric images, though they are irregular in shape).\n\nThere are several ways that humans form and use cognitive maps. Visual intake is a key part of mapping. The first is by using ''landmarks''. This is where a person uses a mental image to estimate a relationship, usually distance, between two objects. The second is ''route-road'' knowledge, and is generally developed after a person has performed a task and is relaying the information of that task to another person. The third is a ''survey''. A person estimates a distance based on a mental image that, to them, might appear like an actual map. This image is generally created when a person's brain begins making image corrections. These are presented in five ways:\n\n# ''Right-angle bias'': when a person straightens out an image, like mapping an intersection, and begins to give everything 90-degree angles, when in reality it may not be that way. \n# ''Symmetry heuristic'': when people tend to think of shapes, or buildings, as being more symmetrical than they really are. \n# ''Rotation heuristic'': when a person takes a naturally (realistically) distorted image and straightens it out for their mental image. \n# ''Alignment heuristic'': similar to the previous, where people align objects mentally to make them straighter than they really are.\n# ''Relative-position heuristic'': people do not accurately distance landmarks in their mental image based on how well they remember that particular item.\n\nAnother method of creating cognitive maps is by means of auditory intake based on verbal descriptions. Using the mapping based from a person's visual intake, another person can create a mental image, such as directions to a certain location.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-111-34476-4|pages=310\u20131315|edition=6th|author2=Karin Sternberg}}</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\"Heuristic device\" is used when an entity X exists to enable understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity Y. A good example is a [[Physical model|model]] that, as [[Map/territory relation|it is never identical with what it models]], is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models. Stories, metaphors, etc., can also be termed heuristic in that sense. A classic example is the notion of [[utopia]] as described in [[Plato]]'s best-known work, ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]''. This means that the \"ideal city\" as depicted in ''The Republic'' is not given as something to be pursued, or to present an orientation-point for development; rather, it shows how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another (often with highly problematic results), if one opted for certain principles and carried them through rigorously.\n\n\"Heuristic\" is also often used as a [[noun]] to describe a [[Rule of thumb|rule-of-thumb]], procedure, or method.<ref>[[Katarzyna Jaszczolt|K.

Wimsatt]], and others.)\n\n== Law ==\nIn [[legal theory]], especially in the theory of [[law and economics]], heuristics are used in the [[law]] when [[case method|case-by-case analysis]] would be impractical, insofar as \"practicality\" is defined by the interests of a governing body.<ref>Gerd Gigerenzer and Christoph Engel, eds. (2007). ''Heuristics and the Law'', Cambridge, The MIT Press, {{ISBN|978-0-262-07275-5}}</ref>\n\nThe present securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons.\nIn truth, actual investors face cognitive  limitations from biases, heuristics, and framing effects.\n\nFor instance, in all states in the [[United States]] the [[legal drinking age]] for unsupervised persons is 21 years, because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption. However, assuming people mature at different rates, the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others. In this case, the somewhat arbitrary deadline is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether an individual is sufficiently mature for society to trust them with that kind of responsibility. Some proposed changes, however, have included the completion of an alcohol education course rather than the attainment of 21 years of age as the criterion for legal alcohol possession. This would put youth alcohol policy more on a case-by-case basis and less on a heuristic one, since the completion of such a course would presumably be voluntary and not uniform across the population.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to [[patent law]]. [[Patent]]s are justified on the grounds that inventors must be protected so they have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that it is in society's best interest that inventors receive a temporary government-granted [[monopoly]] on their idea, so that they can recoup investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period. In the United States, the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the patent application was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking-age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product to be efficient. A 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including [[University of North Dakota]] law professor Eric E. Johnson, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries \u2013 such as [[software patent]]s \u2013 should be protected for different lengths of time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = Eric E. | year = 2006 | title = Calibrating Patent Lifetimes | url = http://www.eejlaw.com/writings/Johnson_Calibrating_Patent_Lifetimes.pdf | journal = Santa Clara Computer & High Technology Law Journal | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 269\u2013314 }}</ref>\n\n== Stereotyping ==\n\nStereotyping is a type of heuristic that people use to form opinions or make judgments about things they have never seen or experienced.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bodenhausen|first1=Galen V.|title=\"On the Dialectics of Discrimination: Dual Processes in Social Stereotyping\", in Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology edited by Shelly Chaiken and Yaacov Trope|date=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|location=NY|isbn=978-1572304215|pages=271\u201392|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5X_auIBx99EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015|display-authors=etal}}</ref> They work as a mental shortcut to assess everything from the social status of a person (based on their actions),<ref name=\":0\" /> to whether a plant is a tree based on the assumption that it is tall, has a trunk, and has leaves (even though the person making the evaluation might never have seen that particular type of tree before).\n\nStereotypes, as first described by journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] in his book ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]'' (1922), are the pictures we have in our heads that are built around experiences as well as what we are told about the world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kleg|first1=Milton|title=Hate Prejudice and Racism|date=1883|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791415368|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aaMuQHO04I0C&pg=PA135&dq=stereotypes+lippmann+pictures+head#v=onepage&q=stereotypes%20lippmann%20pictures%20head&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=G\u00f6k\u00e7en|first1=Sinan|title=Pictures in Our Heads|url=http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2868|website=European Roma Rights Centre|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Artificial intelligence ==\nA [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] can be used in artificial intelligence systems while searching a solution space. The heuristic is derived by using some function that is put into the system by the designer, or by adjusting the weight of branches based on how likely each branch is to lead to a goal node.\n\n== Critiques and controversies ==\nThe concept of heuristics has critiques and controversies. The \"We Cannot Be That Dumb\" critique argues that the average person has low ability to make sound and effective judgments.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|last=|first=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=|editor-last=Gilovich|editor-first=Thomas|location=|pages=8\u20139|editor-last2=Griffin|editor-first2=Dale|editor-last3=Kahnemann|editor-first3=Daniel}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{wikibooks}}\n* [[Algorithm]]\n* [[Behavioral economics]]\n* [[Erudition]]\n* [[Failure mode and effects analysis]]\n*[[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making]] \n* [[List of biases in judgment and decision making]]\n* [[Neuroheuristics]]\n* [[Priority heuristic]]\n* [[Social heuristics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''How To Solve It: Modern Heuristics'', Zbigniew Michalewicz and David B.
