Ware''' is a semi-retired [[United States|American]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who made his professional wrestling debut in 1978. He rose in popularity during the mid 1980s, while appearing in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], where he was initially a strong mid-carder before he eventually became a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber to the stars]]. Ware came to the ring with a [[Blue-and-yellow Macaw]] named Frankie,<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8164777/frankie Frankie; findagrave.com]</ref> and would flap his arms like a bird while dancing before and after his matches. Before joining the WWF, Ware worked as a part of several tag teams, first with [[Bobby Eaton]] in [[Continental Wrestling Association|Memphis]] and then later on with [[Norvell Austin]] as one half of the P.Y.T. Express in several promotions. Ware also holds the distinction of having competed in the first ever match on the first episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' in a losing effort against [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]].\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Early years (1978 - 1986)===\nWare spent his early days in the sport in the Mid-South, Georgia and other NWA territories. Early in his career, \"Koko Ware\" (as he was then known) did not find great success, learning the ropes and paying his dues both in [[Jerry Jarrett]]'s [[Continental Wrestling Association]] and [[Nick Gulas]]' territory in the south.<ref name=\"CWA8-2\">{{cite web| url = http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa8-2.htm | title = Kayfabe Memories: Memphis/CWA (8-2)|accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = Tim Dills}}</ref>\n\nIt was not until late in 1980 that Ware's fortunes changed when he participated in a battle royal to crown the first ever Mid-American Television Champion. The crowd favorite was [[Jimmy Valiant]], who Ware accidentally knocked into [[Daniel Briley|Danny Davis]] and eliminated. Moments later, Koko dumped Davis to the floor and won his first title.<ref name=\"Titles\">{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories  | publisher=Archeus Communications | year=2006|edition=4th | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 }}</ref> After the match, Valiant returned to the ring and beat Ware down. Ware's feud with Valiant was quickly expanded to include the heel [[Tojo Yamamoto]] and Ware's ally, [[Tommy Rich]]. When [[Dutch Mantel]] returned to the CWA in early 1981 he quickly defeated Ware for the TV title making Ware's first run with the gold a short one.<ref name=\"Titles\"/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa7-2.htm | title = Kayfabe Memories: Memphis/CWA (7-2)| accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = Tim Dills}}</ref>\n\nWare floundered until September 1981, when he was chosen to referee a [[AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship|Southern Heavyweight Championship]] title match between [[Jerry Lawler]] and the \"Dream Machine\". Ware unfairly counted Lawler out to give the Dream Machine the victory, a decision that did not sit well with Lawler nor the fans in Memphis. Koko quickly aligned himself with manager [[Jimmy Hart]] and his [[the First Family (professional wrestling)|First Family]] and changed his ring name to \"Sweet Brown Sugar\".<ref name=\"CWA8-2\"/> Sugar never got the best of Lawler but did taste tag-team success alongside [[Steve Keirn]] and then with [[Bobby Eaton]]. Eaton and Sugar won the [[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\n===Stagger Lee===\nAfter successfully teaming for a while, Sugar and Eaton started to show signs of dissension, during their last run with the tag-team title Eaton beat [[Jacques Rougeau]] for the [[NWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship|Mid-American Heavyweight title]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/> During an interview where Eaton and Hart bragged about the victory, Sugar complained that he was unable to win the Southern Title from [[Terry Taylor]]. After being fed up, Hart finally slapped Sugar and sent the sulking superstar back to the dressing room after which Eaton commented that Sugar had been \"whining like a woman\". Later that night the duo defended their title against Taylor and [[Bill Dundee]], losing the title when Sugar \"accidentally\" kicked Eaton and then left the ring.<ref name=\"Titles\"/><ref name=\"Eaton\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Wrestlers/WLeaton-2.htm | title = Kayfabe Memories: Bobby Eaton profile (part 2) | accessdate =2007-04-03|author=Tim Dills}}</ref> Eaton and Sugar contested a series of grudge matches centered around the Mid-America title and their issues with each other.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> The feud got so out of control that it had to be settled with a \"loser leaves town\" match, a match that Eaton won, driving Sugar out of the arena. Later, a masked man calling himself \"Stagger Lee\" debuted; the fact that he looked and wrestled like a masked version of Sugar helped make him instantly popular. Eaton, along with the rest of the First Family, tried in vain to unmask Lee but could not manage to do so.<ref name=\"Eaton\"/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa10-2.htm | title = Kayfabe Memories: Memphis/CWA (10-2) | accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = Tim Dills}}</ref>\n\n===Pretty Young Things===\n[[File:Lanny Poffo vs. Koko B. Ware2.jpg|thumb|Ware against Lanny Poffo]]\nBobby Eaton later turned face, he teamed with \"Stagger Lee\" for a series of matches. During a tag-team tournament in 1983, the masked Stagger Lee teamed up with fellow face [[Norvell Austin]] to take on \"Fargo's Fabulous Ones\" ([[Tommy Rich]] and [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|\"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert]]). During the course of the match Stagger Lee's mask was removed to reveal the man beneath it, prompting a heel turn for Ware. Austin and Ware became a regular tag team dubbed the ''[[Pretty Young Things]]'' or (\"the PYT Express\").<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa11-2.htm | title = Kayfabe Memories: Memphis/CWA (11-2) | accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = Tim Dills}}</ref> The two men soon began wearing red leather jackets, and each had a single white glove on, in an obvious imitation of [[Michael Jackson]] to further enhance their \"pretty boy\" image.<ref name=\"TagPYT\">{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | year=2005| chapter= Imitation is the sinceres form of flattery | pages= 261\u2013264 | isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}</ref>\n\nThe team defeated [[Leroy Brown (wrestler)|Elijah Akeem]] and [[Ray Candy|Kareem Mohammad]] for the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship in February 1984; almost two weeks later, Akeem and Mohammad regained the title.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> The PYT Express remained in Memphis for a period of time after this before moving on to other promotions such as [[Mid-South Wrestling]], [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] in [[Texas]] and Championship Wrestling from Florida. On February 26, 1985 Austin and Ware defeated [[Steven Romero|Jay]] and [[Mark Youngblood]] to win the [[NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship]]. Two weeks later on March 5, 1985 the team re-lost the title to the Youngbloods.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> After dropping the gold in Florida, the Pretty Young Things returned to the federation that first put them together, the Continental Wrestling Association. There, they won the AWA Southern Tag Team title twice, both times from [[The Fabulous Ones]] ([[Steve Keirn]] and [[Stan Lane]]) as they feuded with the top face team of the promotion.<ref name=\"Titles\"/><ref>{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}</ref>\n\nAfter the PYT's disbanded, Koko moved on to Bill Watts' Mid-South/UWF territory, where he started calling himself Koko B. Ware.  Ware's persona was that of a face who entered the ring to the theme of Morris Day's \"The Bird\", doing an arm-flapping dance.\n\n===World Wrestling Federation===\n====The Birdman (1986&ndash;1992)====\nIn 1986, Ware signed with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], where he continued his fun-loving \"Birdman\" Koko B. Ware\" persona, complete with a [[macaw]] named \"Frankie\". Ware made his debut as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] on the September 6, 1986, episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'', teaming with [[Paul Roma]] against [[Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart]]) in a losing effort. His first victory was on the September 7 episode of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge|Wrestling Challenge]]'' against Bob Bradley. He made his entrances dancing to the ring to the tune of Morris Day and [[The Time (band)|The Time]]'s \"The Bird\", flapping his arms and carrying Frankie, who sat on a perch at ringside while Ware wrestled. Bright outfits, colorful sunglasses, a constant smile and his [[vibrato]] singing voice made Ware popular, especially with the younger crowd that the WWF mainly catered to during the 1980s.<ref name=\"WWE80s\">{{cite book| author=Brian Shields| title=Main event \u2013 WWE in the raging 80s| publisher=Pocket Books| year=2006| edition=4th| isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria}}</ref> Ware also sang the title track of the 1987 WWF album ''[[Piledriver: The Wrestling Album 2|Piledriver]]'', which then became his entrance music. The song's video featured top wrestlers of the day like [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[The Honky Tonk Man]], as well as WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]] wearing a red \"Hulkamania\" shirt and hard hat.\n\nWare garnered his first big win of his initial WWF run when he upset [[Harley Race]] at a house show in East Rutherford, NJ, on October 13. On television, his first major showcase was at the November 29, 1986 ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event VIII]]'' where he defeated [[Nikolai Volkoff]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/snme.html#8 | title = WWF Saturday Night's Main Event Results (#8) | accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> He was then granted an Intercontinental Title match against champion [[Randy Savage]] on the November 16 edition of ''[[WWF Superstars]]'', a bout which went to a double countout. The same taping later saw Ware defeat Savage by countout in a dark match.\n\nWare, however, would often be on the losing end when he came up against other established stars, stars as [[Butch Reed]], [[Hercules]], [[Greg Valentine]], and [[Ray Traylor|The Big Boss Man]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#III | title = WWF WrestleMania Results (III) | accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/snme.html#14| title = WWF Saturday Night's Main Event Results (#14) | accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/summer.html#88 | title = WWF SummerSlam Results (1988) | accessdate = April 3, 2007 | author = prowrestlinghistory.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061913/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/summer.html#88 | archive-date = October 23, 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref> From 1987 to 1993, Ware appeared on several WWF PPVs (including [[WrestleMania III]] where he lost to Reed) and editions of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', being used mainly to make established or rising stars look good. Ware was the first wrestler on television to fall victim to the [[Suplex|Perfect-plex]] of newcomer [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] on the January 7, 1989, episode of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XIX]]'', while at the [[Survivor Series (1990)|1990 Survivor Series]], Ware became the first wrestler to fall victim to [[The Undertaker]]'s [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone piledriver]] in the Undertaker's WWF debut match.\n\nDuring a 1989 European tour, Ware was fired for his part in a physical altercation with WWF executive [[Jim Troy (ice hockey)|Jim Troy]]. Troy had used racial slurs during an argument after which the dispute turned physical. Ware was later rehired, a little over a month later, when Troy resigned.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling|author=Hart, Bret|authorlink=Bret Hart|publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]|year=2008}}</ref>\n\n====High Energy (1992&ndash;1993)====\nIn 1992, Ware teamed up with [[Owen Hart]] to form the high flying team known as High Energy, well known in wrestling circles for their gigantic baggy brightly colored pants and checkered suspenders.

The team ended in March 1993 after Hart injured his knee.

At the same time, Ware made appearances in the USWA as part of a talent exchange program with WWF. He continued wrestling in the promotion through the remainder of the year.\n\nKoko returned to WWF in 1994 when he appeared on the March 21 episode of ''Monday Night Raw'' and faced [[Jeff Jarrett]].<ref name=WWF314>{{cite book|title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1990\u20131999|last=Cawthon|first=Graham|pages=314|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4935-6689-1}}</ref> He would then appear on the April 9 episode of ''Superstars'' in a loss to [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R.

By 1992 the WWF and the [[United States Wrestling Association]] started a talent exchange agreement which saw Koko B. Ware return to Memphis. In the USWA Koko was more successful than in the WWF, winning the [[USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship|USWA World Title]] twice, once from [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala \"The Ugandan Giant\"]] and once from USWA icon [[Jerry Lawler]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/> Koko also hooked up with Rex Hargrove and won the [[USWA Tag Team Championship]] once in 1993.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> In 1996 he feuded with [[Brian Christopher]] and [[Jerry Lawler]].

Started working for the [[independent circuit]]. In 1998 to 1999 he wrestled for [[Power Pro Wrestling]] in Memphis. In 1999, he retired from wrestling and took a couple of years off.\n\n===Return to Wrestling (2001\u2013present) ===\nOn May 18, 2001, Ware returned to wrestling and defeated [[Brickhouse Brown]] at Galaxy Championship Wrestling in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nBy 2003 Ware began to wrestle full time again.

Ware''' is a semi-retired [[United States|American]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who made his professional wrestling debut in 1978. He rose in popularity during the mid 1980s, while appearing in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], where he was initially a strong mid-carder before he eventually became a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber to the stars]]. Ware came to the ring with a [[Blue-and-yellow Macaw|blue-and-yellow macaw]] named Frankie,<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8164777/frankie Frankie; findagrave.com]</ref> and would flap his arms like a bird while dancing before and after his matches. Before joining the WWF, Ware worked as a part of several tag teams, first with [[Bobby Eaton]] in [[Continental Wrestling Association|Memphis]] and then later on with [[Norvell Austin]] as one half of the P.Y.T. Express in several promotions. Ware also holds the distinction of having competed in the first ever match on the first episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' in a losing effort against [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]].\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Early years (1978 - 1986)===\nWare spent his early days in the sport in the Mid-South, Georgia and other NWA territories. Early in his career, \"Koko Ware\" (as he was then known) did not find great success, learning the ropes and paying his dues both in [[Jerry Jarrett]]'s [[Continental Wrestling Association]] and [[Nick Gulas]]' territory in the south.<ref name=\"CWA8-2\">{{cite web| url = http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa8-2.htm | title = Kayfabe Memories: Memphis/CWA (8-2)|accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = Tim Dills}}</ref>\n\nIt was not until late in 1980 that Ware's fortunes changed when he participated in a battle royal to crown the first ever Mid-American Television Champion. The crowd favorite was [[Jimmy Valiant]], who Ware accidentally knocked into [[Daniel Briley|Danny Davis]] and eliminated. Moments later, Koko dumped Davis to the floor and won his first title.<ref name=\"Titles\">{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories  | publisher=Archeus Communications | year=2006|edition=4th | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 }}</ref> After the match, Valiant returned to the ring and beat Ware down. Ware's feud with Valiant was quickly expanded to include the heel [[Tojo Yamamoto]] and Ware's ally, [[Tommy Rich]]. When [[Dutch Mantel]] returned to the CWA in early 1981 he quickly defeated Ware for the TV title making Ware's first run with the gold a short one.<ref name=\"Titles\"/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa7-2.htm | title = Kayfabe Memories: Memphis/CWA (7-2)| accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = Tim Dills}}</ref>\n\nWare floundered until September 1981, when he was chosen to referee a [[AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship|Southern Heavyweight Championship]] title match between [[Jerry Lawler]] and the \"Dream Machine\". Ware unfairly counted Lawler out to give the Dream Machine the victory, a decision that did not sit well with Lawler nor the fans in Memphis. Koko quickly aligned himself with manager [[Jimmy Hart]] and his [[the First Family (professional wrestling)|First Family]] and changed his ring name to \"Sweet Brown Sugar\".<ref name=\"CWA8-2\"/> Sugar never got the best of Lawler but did taste tag-team success alongside [[Steve Keirn]] and then with [[Bobby Eaton]]. Eaton and Sugar won the [[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\n===Stagger Lee===\nAfter successfully teaming for a while, Sugar and Eaton started to show signs of dissension, during their last run with the tag-team title Eaton beat [[Jacques Rougeau]] for the [[NWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship|Mid-American Heavyweight title]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/> During an interview where Eaton and Hart bragged about the victory, Sugar complained that he was unable to win the Southern Title from [[Terry Taylor]]. After being fed up, Hart finally slapped Sugar and sent the sulking superstar back to the dressing room after which Eaton commented that Sugar had been \"whining like a woman\". Later that night the duo defended their title against Taylor and [[Bill Dundee]], losing the title when Sugar \"accidentally\" kicked Eaton and then left the ring.<ref name=\"Titles\"/><ref name=\"Eaton\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Wrestlers/WLeaton-2.htm | title = Kayfabe Memories: Bobby Eaton profile (part 2) | accessdate =2007-04-03|author=Tim Dills}}</ref> Eaton and Sugar contested a series of grudge matches centered around the Mid-America title and their issues with each other.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> The feud got so out of control that it had to be settled with a \"loser leaves town\" match, a match that Eaton won, driving Sugar out of the arena. Later, a masked man calling himself \"Stagger Lee\" debuted; the fact that he looked and wrestled like a masked version of Sugar helped make him instantly popular. Eaton, along with the rest of the First Family, tried in vain to unmask Lee but could not manage to do so.<ref name=\"Eaton\"/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa10-2.htm | title = Kayfabe Memories: Memphis/CWA (10-2) | accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = Tim Dills}}</ref>\n\n===Pretty Young Things===\n[[File:Lanny Poffo vs. Koko B. Ware2.jpg|thumb|Ware against Lanny Poffo]]\nBobby Eaton later turned face, he teamed with \"Stagger Lee\" for a series of matches. During a tag-team tournament in 1983, the masked Stagger Lee teamed up with fellow face [[Norvell Austin]] to take on \"Fargo's Fabulous Ones\" ([[Tommy Rich]] and [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|\"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert]]). During the course of the match Stagger Lee's mask was removed to reveal the man beneath it, prompting a heel turn for Ware. Austin and Ware became a regular tag team dubbed the ''[[Pretty Young Things]]'' or (\"the PYT Express\").<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa11-2.htm | title = Kayfabe Memories: Memphis/CWA (11-2) | accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = Tim Dills}}</ref> The two men soon began wearing red leather jackets, and each had a single white glove on, in an obvious imitation of [[Michael Jackson]] to further enhance their \"pretty boy\" image.<ref name=\"TagPYT\">{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | year=2005| chapter= Imitation is the sinceres form of flattery | pages= 261\u2013264 | isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}</ref>\n\nThe team defeated [[Leroy Brown (wrestler)|Elijah Akeem]] and [[Ray Candy|Kareem Mohammad]] for the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship in February 1984; almost two weeks later, Akeem and Mohammad regained the title.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> The PYT Express remained in Memphis for a period of time after this before moving on to other promotions such as [[Mid-South Wrestling]], [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] in [[Texas]] and Championship Wrestling from Florida. On February 26, 1985 Austin and Ware defeated [[Steven Romero|Jay]] and [[Mark Youngblood]] to win the [[NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship]]. Two weeks later on March 5, 1985 the team re-lost the title to the Youngbloods.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> After dropping the gold in Florida, the Pretty Young Things returned to the federation that first put them together, the Continental Wrestling Association. There, they won the AWA Southern Tag Team title twice, both times from [[The Fabulous Ones]] ([[Steve Keirn]] and [[Stan Lane]]) as they feuded with the top face team of the promotion.<ref name=\"Titles\"/><ref>{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}</ref>\n\nAfter the PYT's disbanded, Koko moved on to Bill Watts' Mid-South/UWF territory, where he started calling himself Koko B. Ware.  Ware's persona was that of a face who entered the ring to the theme of Morris Day's \"The Bird\", doing an arm-flapping dance.\n\n===World Wrestling Federation===\n====The Birdman (1986&ndash;1992)====\nIn 1986, Ware signed with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], where he continued his fun-loving \"Birdman\" Koko B. Ware\" persona, complete with a [[macaw]] named \"Frankie\". Ware made his debut as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] on the September 6, 1986, episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'', teaming with [[Paul Roma]] against [[Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart]]) in a losing effort. His first victory was on the September 7 episode of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge|Wrestling Challenge]]'' against Bob Bradley. He made his entrances dancing to the ring to the tune of Morris Day and [[The Time (band)|The Time]]'s \"The Bird\", flapping his arms and carrying Frankie, who sat on a perch at ringside while Ware wrestled. Bright outfits, colorful sunglasses, a constant smile and his [[vibrato]] singing voice made Ware popular, especially with the younger crowd that the WWF mainly catered to during the 1980s.<ref name=\"WWE80s\">{{cite book| author=Brian Shields| title=Main event \u2013 WWE in the raging 80s| publisher=Pocket Books| year=2006| edition=4th| isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria}}</ref> Ware also sang the title track of the 1987 WWF album ''[[Piledriver: The Wrestling Album 2|Piledriver]]'', which then became his entrance music. The song's video featured top wrestlers of the day like [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[The Honky Tonk Man]], as well as WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]] wearing a red \"Hulkamania\" shirt and hard hat.\n\nWare garnered his first big win of his initial WWF run when he upset [[Harley Race]] at a house show in East Rutherford, NJ, on October 13. On television, his first major showcase was at the November 29, 1986 ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event VIII]]'' where he defeated [[Nikolai Volkoff]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/snme.html#8 | title = WWF Saturday Night's Main Event Results (#8) | accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> He was then granted an Intercontinental Title match against champion [[Randy Savage]] on the November 16 edition of ''[[WWF Superstars]]'', a bout which went to a double countout. The same taping later saw Ware defeat Savage by countout in a dark match.\n\nWare, however, would often be on the losing end when he came up against other established stars, stars as [[Butch Reed]], [[Hercules]], [[Greg Valentine]], and [[Ray Traylor|The Big Boss Man]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#III | title = WWF WrestleMania Results (III) | accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/snme.html#14| title = WWF Saturday Night's Main Event Results (#14) | accessdate = April 3, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/summer.html#88 | title = WWF SummerSlam Results (1988) | accessdate = April 3, 2007 | author = prowrestlinghistory.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061913/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/summer.html#88 | archive-date = October 23, 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref> From 1987 to 1993, Ware appeared on several WWF PPVs (including [[WrestleMania III]] where he lost to Reed) and editions of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', being used mainly to make established or rising stars look good. Ware was the first wrestler on television to fall victim to the [[Suplex|Perfect-plex]] of newcomer [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] on the January 7, 1989, episode of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XIX]]'', while at the [[Survivor Series (1990)|1990 Survivor Series]], Ware became the first wrestler to fall victim to [[The Undertaker]]'s [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone piledriver]] in the Undertaker's WWF debut match.\n\nDuring a 1989 European tour, Ware was fired for his part in a physical altercation with WWF executive [[Jim Troy (ice hockey)|Jim Troy]]. Troy had used racial slurs during an argument after which the dispute turned physical. Ware was later rehired, a little over a month later, when Troy resigned.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling|author=Hart, Bret|authorlink=Bret Hart|publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]|year=2008}}</ref>\n\n====High Energy (1992&ndash;1993)====\nIn 1992, Ware teamed up with [[Owen Hart]] to form the high flying team known as High Energy, well known in wrestling circles for their gigantic baggy brightly colored pants and checkered suspenders.

At the same time, Ware made appearances in the USWA as part of a talent exchange program with WWF. He continued wrestling in the promotion through the remainder of the year.\n\nKoko returned to WWF in 1994 when he appeared on the March 21 episode of ''Monday Night Raw'' and faced [[Jeff Jarrett]].<ref name=WWF314>{{cite book|title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1990\u20131999|last=Cawthon|first=Graham|pages=314|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4935-6689-1}}</ref> He would then appear on the April 9 episode of ''Superstars'' in a loss to [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R.

By 1992 the WWF and the [[United States Wrestling Association]] started a talent exchange agreement which saw Koko B. Ware return to Memphis.

In 1999, he retired from wrestling and took a couple of years off.\n\n===Return to Wrestling (2001-present) ===\nOn May 18, 2001, Ware returned to wrestling and defeated [[Brickhouse Brown]] at Galaxy Championship Wrestling in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nBy 2003 Ware began to wrestle full time again.
