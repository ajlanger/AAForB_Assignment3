[[Magnesium]], [[aluminium]] and [[zinc]] ''can'' react with water, but the reaction is usually very slow unless the metal samples are specially prepared to remove the surface layer of oxide which protects the rest of the metal. [[Copper]] and [[silver]] will react with [[nitric acid]]; but because nitric acid is an [[oxidizing acid]], the oxidizing agent is not the H<sup>+</sup> ion as in normal acids, but the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> ion.\n\n=== Single displacement reactions ===\n\nAn iron nail placed in a solution of [[Copper(II) sulphate|copper sulfate]] will quickly change colour as metallic copper is deposited and the iron is converted into [[iron(II) sulfate]]:\n\n:Fe (s) + CuSO<sub>4</sub> (aq) \u2192 Cu (s) + FeSO<sub>4</sub> (aq)\n\nIn general, a metal can displace any of the metals which are lower in the reactivity series: the higher metal [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduces]] the ions of the lower metal. This is used in the [[thermite reaction]] for preparing small quantities of metallic iron, and in the [[Kroll process]] for preparing [[titanium]] (Ti comes at about the same level as Al in the reactivity series). For example, aluminium will reduce [[iron(III) oxide]] to iron, becoming [[aluminium oxide]] in the process:\n\n:2Al (s) + Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (s) \u2192 2Fe (s) + Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (s)\n\nSimilarly, [[magnesium]] can be used to extract [[titanium]] from [[titanium tetrachloride]], forming [[magnesium chloride]] in the process:\n\n:2 Mg (s) + TiCl<sub>4</sub> (l) \u2192 Ti (s) + 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub> (s)\n\nHowever, other factors can come into play, such as in the preparation of metallic [[potassium]] by the reduction of [[potassium chloride]] with sodium at 850&nbsp;\u00b0C. Although sodium is lower than potassium in the reactivity series, the reaction can proceed because potassium is more volatile, and is distilled off from the mixture.\n\n:Na (g) + KCl (l) \u2192 K (g) + NaCl (l)\n\n== Comparison with standard electrode potentials ==\nThe reactivity series is sometimes quoted in the strict reverse order of [[standard electrode potential]]s, when it is also known as the \"[[electrochemical series]]\":\n:Li > Cs > Rb > K > Ba > Sr > Na > Ca > Mg > Be > Al > H( water) > Mn > Zn > Cr(+3) > Fe(+2) > Cd > Co > Ni > Sn > Pb > H(in acids) > Cu > Fe(+3) > Hg > Ag > Pd > Ir > Pt(+2) > Au\nThe positions of [[lithium]] and [[sodium]] are changed on such a series; gold and platinum are in joint position and not gold leading, although this has little practical significance as both metals are highly unreactive.\n\nStandard electrode potentials offer a quantitative measure of the power of a reducing agent, rather than the qualitative considerations of other reactive series. However, they are only valid for ''standard'' conditions: in particular, they only apply to reactions in aqueous solution. Even with this proviso, the electrode potentials of lithium and sodium \u2013 and hence their positions in the electrochemical series \u2013 appear anomalous. The order of reactivity, as shown by the vigour of the reaction with water or the speed at which the metal surface tarnishes in air, appears to be\n:potassium > sodium > lithium > alkaline earth metals,\nthe same as the reverse order of the (gas-phase) [[Ionization energy|ionization energies]]. This is borne out by the extraction of metallic lithium by the electrolysis of a [[eutectic]] mixture of [[lithium chloride]] and [[potassium chloride]]: lithium metal is formed at the cathode, not potassium.<ref name=\"G&E\">{{Greenwood&Earnshaw1st|pages=82\u201387}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Reactivity (chemistry)]], which discusses the inconsistent way that the term 'reactivity' is used in chemistry.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040508085524/http://www.sciencenet.org.uk/database/chem/industrial/c00109b.html Science Line Chemistry]\n\n[[Category:Inorganic chemistry]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Electrochemical series}}\n\nIn chemistry, a '''reactivity series '''(or '''activity series''') is an empirical, calculated, and structurally analytical progression<ref name=\"G&E\" /> of a series of [[metal]]s, arranged by their \"reactivity\" from highest to lowest.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.gcsescience.com/r1-reactivity-series-metals.htm | title = The Reactivity Series of Metals | first = Colin | last = France | year = 2008}}</ref><ref>{{citation | title = Science in Focus, Chemistry for GCE 'O' Level | first = J.
