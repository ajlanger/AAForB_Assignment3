He is a small, green humanoid alien with tremendous power in the Force. In his first appearance in the original trilogy, the spirit of Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi describes Yoda as the Jedi master who trained him and asks Luke Skywalker to seek Jedi training from Yoda, which Luke does and later uses to fight against the Galactic Empire. The character reappears in Return of the Jedi where he reveals his age to be 900, making him the oldest living character in the Star Wars franchise.\n\nIn the prequel trilogy, set a generation before the original trilogy, Yoda is among the most powerful members of the Jedi Order and a general of clone troopers during the Clone Wars. He also trains all Jedi children, before they are assigned a Jedi master. Yoda appears again in the sequel trilogy, advising Luke.\n\n\nContents\n1\tConcept and creation\n1.1\tCharacter overview\n1.2\tOther members of species\n2\tAppearances\n2.1\tSkywalker saga\n2.2\tAnimated series\n2.3\tCanon media\n2.4\tLegends\n3\tIn popular culture\n3.1\tMerchandising\n4\tSee also\n5\tReferences\n6\tExternal links\nConcept and creation\nFrank Oz provided Yoda's voice in each film and used his skills as a puppeteer in the original trilogy, Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. For some walking scenes in Episodes V and I, dwarf actors Deep Roy and Warwick Davis appeared in costume as Yoda (though neither was credited). While Frank Oz served as the primary performer, he was assisted by a multitude of other puppeteers, including:[5] Kathryn Mullen (Ep. V), Wendy Froud (Ep. V), David Barclay (Ep. V-VI), Mike Quinn (Ep. VI), David Greenaway (Ep. I & VI), Don Austen (Ep. I), Kathy Smee (Ep. I), Dave Chapman (Ep. VIII), Damian Farrell (Ep. VIII), and Colin Purves (Ep. VIII). For the radio dramatizations of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Yoda was voiced by John Lithgow, while Tom Kane voiced him in the Clone Wars animated series, several video games, and the series Star Wars: The Clone Wars.\n\nThe make-up artist Stuart Freeborn based Yoda's face partly on his own and partly on Albert Einstein's.[6][7][8][9] In The Phantom Menace, he was redesigned to look younger. He was computer-generated for two distant shots, but remained mostly a puppet.[10] The puppet was re-designed by Nick Dudman from Stuart Freeborn's original design.\n\nRendered with computer animation in Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith, Yoda appeared in ways not previously possible, including his participation in elaborate fight scenes. In Revenge of the Sith, his face appears in several big close-ups, demanding highly detailed CGI work. His performance was deliberately designed to be consistent with the limitations of the puppet version, with some \"mistakes\" made such as the occasional ear-jiggling.[citation needed] Rob Coleman was responsible for the character's new incarnation to the series.\n\nYoda was recreated in CGI for the 2011 Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace.[11] A clip of the new CG Yoda from The Phantom Menace was first seen in the featurette The Chosen One, included in the 2005 DVD release of Revenge of the Sith.[12] The 2012 theatrical 3D release of The Phantom Menace also features the CG version of Yoda.\n\nCharacter overview\nJedi Master Yoda is amongst the oldest, most stoic and most powerful known Jedi Masters in the Star Wars universe. Series creator George Lucas opted to have many details of the character's life history remain unknown. Yoda's race and home world have not been named in any official media, canonical or otherwise, and he is merely said to be of a \"species unknown\" by the Star Wars Databank. Yoda's characteristic speech patterns have been analyzed and discussed by academic syntacticians, who found it somewhat inconsistent, but could extrapolate that it has object\u2013subject\u2013verb word order[13] making it anastrophe.\n\nThe films and Expanded Universe reveal that he had a hand in training almost every Jedi Master in the galaxy. In the Star Wars prequel films, he instructs several younglings in the Jedi Temple before they are assigned to a master. In The Empire Strikes Back he mentions that he had been training Jedi \"for 800 years\", which means he must have been a Master Jedi for quite some time before that.\n\nOther members of species\nTwo other members of Yoda's unnamed alien species are known: Yaddle (who appears as a background female character in the prequel trilogy film Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace as a Jedi master) and the character in The Mandalorian known currently as \"The Child\" (called \"Baby Yoda\" by fans and media). Their respective relation (if any) to Yoda is unknown. Very little is known about Yoda's alien species, though all three are powerful in The Force.[14][15]\n\nAppearances\nSkywalker saga\nMain article: Skywalker saga\nOriginal trilogy\nThe Empire Strikes Back (1980)\nYoda makes his first film appearance in The Empire Strikes Back. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) arrives on Dagobah to seek his guidance, having been instructed to do so by the Force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), who describes him as \"the Jedi Master who instructed me\".\n\nYoda does not initially identify himself to Luke and instead tests his patience by presenting himself as a comical backwater individual, deliberately provoking both Luke and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). Luke is shocked when he finally discovers that this small, eccentric creature is the powerful Jedi Master he was seeking. Finding that Luke has the same anger and recklessness which caused his father's downfall, Yoda is reluctant to teach him the ways of the Force, and agrees only at Obi-Wan's behest. Before finishing his training, however, Luke chooses to leave Dagobah in order to confront Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and save his friends on Bespin. Yoda and Obi-Wan warn him that he is not ready to face Vader and is being lured into a trap, but Luke leaves anyway, promising to return. When Obi-Wan laments that Luke is their \"last hope,\" Yoda reminds him that \"there is another\".\n\nReturn of the Jedi (1983)\nYoda makes a brief appearance in Return of the Jedi, set a year after The Empire Strikes Back. Yoda, now sick and frail, informs Luke that he has completed his training but will not be a Jedi until he confronts Darth Vader; he also confirms that Vader is Luke's father, something Vader had told Luke in the previous film. Yoda then peacefully dies at the age of 900, his body disappearing as he becomes \"one with the Force\". He leaves Luke with the knowledge that \"there is another Skywalker\". Moments later, Obi-Wan's ghost helps Luke come to the realization that the \"other\" of whom Yoda spoke is Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), who is his twin sister.\n\nIn the film's final scene, after the Empire has been defeated, Luke sees Yoda's spirit looking upon him with pride, alongside Obi-Wan and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw in the original version of the film, Hayden Christensen in the 2004 DVD release), Vader's former Jedi self.[16]\n\nPrequel trilogy\nStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\nYoda returns as a younger version of himself in the prequel trilogy beginning with The Phantom Menace. The film marked the final time Oz would portray the character as a puppet, until the release of The Last Jedi (2017).[17] However, in the 2011 Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace, the Yoda puppet was replaced by a CGI character to match the later depiction of the character. In the film, which is set 35 years before The Empire Strikes Back, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) brings the young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) to the Jedi Council. Qui-Gon is convinced that Anakin is the \"Chosen One\" of Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force, and requests the boy be trained as a Jedi. Yoda senses great fear in Anakin, especially in regards to his attachment to his mother Shmi (Pernilla August), and foresees \"grave danger\" in his training. The Council, led at the time by Yoda's former padawan Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), rejects Qui-Gon's request.\n\nWhen Qui-Gon is mortally wounded in a duel with Sith Lord Darth Maul (played by Ray Park and voiced by Peter Serafinowicz), his dying request to his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is that Anakin be trained as a Jedi. Obi-Wan, determined to fulfill his promise to his master, tells Yoda that he will train the boy, even without the Council's approval. Yoda makes Obi-Wan a Jedi Knight, and reluctantly gives his blessing to Anakin's training.[18]\n\nStar Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\nYoda holding a lightsaber\nYoda's CGI appearance in Attack of the Clones\nYoda makes his first CGI appearance in Attack of the Clones, set a decade after The Phantom Menace. Yoda, now in direct control of the Order's policy as Master of the High Council in addition to his traditional position as Grandmaster, is one of the many Jedi who are concerned about the emergence of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a secessionist movement wanting independence from the Galactic Republic. After the first attempted assassination of Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala (Natalie Portman), Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) suggests that she be put under the protection of Obi-Wan, who is training Anakin (now played by Hayden Christensen). In a deleted scene, a meditating Yoda senses Anakin slaughtering the Tusken Raiders who murdered his mother.\n\nAt the climax of the film, Yoda arrives in time to save Obi-Wan and Anakin from the Separatists and defeats his former apprentice, Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), the Separatists\u2019 leader and a Sith lord, in a lightsaber duel.\n\nStar Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\nIn Revenge of the Sith, Yoda leads the Jedi Council in pursuing the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Palpatine has by now amassed near-dictatorial emergency powers, and begins interfering in Jedi affairs by appointing Anakin as his personal representative on the Council. The Council grants Anakin a Council seat, but denies him the rank of Master, feeling that doing so would amount to giving Palpatine a vote in the Council. Additionally, they order him to spy on Palpatine, whom Anakin considers a friend and mentor.\n\nAnakin seeks Yoda's counsel about his prophetic visions that someone close to him will die. Yoda, unaware that the person Anakin speaks of is Padm\u00e9, or that she is Anakin's wife and pregnant with his child, tells him to \"train yourself to let go of everything that you fear to lose\". Unsatisfied, Anakin turns to Palpatine, who then reveals himself as Darth Sidious. Palpatine manipulates the young Jedi into becoming his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader, with the promise that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save Padm\u00e9 from dying in childbirth.\n\nPalpatine later transforms the Republic into the tyrannical Galactic Empire, proclaiming himself emperor for life, and orders the clone troopers to kill their Jedi generals. At this time, Yoda is on Kashyyyk, overseeing the battle between the Separatist forces and a combined command of clone troopers and Wookiees. Through the Force, Yoda feels the deaths of each of the Jedi as they are assassinated by their own troops. After swiftly killing the clone troopers instructed to kill him, he escapes with Wookiee leaders Tarfful (Michael Kingma) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and returns to Coruscant, where he and Obi-Wan fight their way into the Jedi Temple to stop a trap for all surviving Jedi. Inside, they discover that all the Jedi inside, younglings included, have been slaughtered. They then discover a holographic recording, revealing Vader as the assassin. Yoda decides to face Palpatine, sending Obi-Wan to kill Vader. When Obi-Wan protests, Yoda tells him that the Anakin he knew no longer exists, having been \"consumed by Darth Vader\".\n\nSubsequently, Yoda battles Palpatine in a lightsaber duel that wrecks the Senate Rotunda. In the end, neither is able to overcome the other and Yoda is forced to retreat. He goes into exile on Dagobah so that he may hide from the Empire and wait for another opportunity to destroy the Sith. At the end of the film, it is revealed that Yoda has been in contact with Qui-Gon's spirit, learning the secret of immortality from him and passing it on to Obi-Wan.\n\nYoda is also instrumental in deciding the fate of the Skywalker children after Padm\u00e9 dies in childbirth, recommending that Luke and Leia be hidden from Vader and Palpatine; he sends Leia to be adopted by Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) of Alderaan, and Luke to Vader's stepfamily Owen (Joel Edgerton) and Beru Lars (Bonnie Piesse) on Tatooine. Other than the ancient Jedi Master, only the Organas, the Lars family, R2-D2 and Obi-Wan know of their true identities.[19]\n\nSequel trilogy\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)\nIn The Force Awakens, set 30 years after Yoda's death in Return of the Jedi, Yoda's voice is heard by the young scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) after she discovers Luke Skywalker's lightsaber in a bar owned by supporting character Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o).[20]\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)\nIn Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Yoda appears to Luke as a Force spirit as Luke debates whether to burn down the tree storing the only remaining copies of the Sacred Texts of the Jedi.[21] As Luke makes his way to the tree, Yoda appears behind him and reminds him that a Jedi must always be sure of his path. When Luke decides against burning down the tree and destroying the texts, Yoda summons a lightning bolt down upon the tree, setting it ablaze. When confronting Yoda as to why he did it, Yoda tells Luke that true Jedi knowledge is not found in books, but within Jedi themselves, and it is their responsibility to pass that knowledge on. As Luke takes in the message, he sits with Yoda and shares a quiet moment with his former master.\n\nUnlike in the prequels, where fight scenes necessitated the character be rendered in with computer-generated imagery, Yoda is once more portrayed using puppetry.[22]\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\nYoda appeared in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker via voice-over, as one of the voices of Jedi past who speak to Rey during her battle against Emperor Palpatine.[23]\n\nAnimated series\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)\nYoda appears in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, voiced by Tom Kane. In the prequel film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Yoda assigns Anakin Skywalker (voiced by Matt Lanter) his own Padawan, Ahsoka Tano (voiced by Ashley Eckstein), as he believes that she will help Anakin grow as a Jedi and as a person. Throughout most of the series, Yoda spends his time on Coruscant with the Jedi Council, but he occasionally leaves for certain tasks, such as negotiations with King Katuunko (voiced by Brian George) on Rugosa, and a confrontation with Asajj Ventress' (voiced by Grey DeLisle) droid army. Yoda also watches over Anakin and Ahsoka throughout the series, pleased that they are both maturing due to each other's influence. However, in the final arc of season five, Ahsoka is framed for a crime she didn't commit, and Yoda and the Jedi Council expel her and turn her over to the Republic military. Along with other members of the Council, Yoda observes Ahsoka's trial, but Anakin bursts in with the true culprit, fallen Jedi Barriss Offee (voiced by Meredith Salenger), before the verdict can be read. Afterwards Yoda, Anakin and the Council personally invite Ahsoka to rejoin the Order, but she refuses and leaves. According to show runner Dave Filoni, Yoda blames himself for Ahsoka's departure, as he had made her Anakin's padawan in the first place.\n\nIn the final arc of the final season, Yoda hears Qui-Gon Jinn speaking to him from beyond the grave. Yoda flees the Jedi Temple with R2-D2 to travel to Dagobah, his future home, to find answers. Shown cryptic visions of the fall of the Jedi, Yoda learns he has been \"chosen\" to learn how to manifest his consciousness after death as a Force ghost. Yoda is tested by a group of spirit priestesses in order to overcome trials and temptations on his pilgrimage; one of these tests is to face an illusion of ancient Sith lord Darth Bane (voiced by Mark Hamill). Yoda's final test is to resist an attempt by Darth Sidious and Dooku to lure him to the dark side with a false vision of deceased Jedi Master Sifo Dyas. Yoda engages in a metaphysical battle with Sidious, and appears to sacrifice his life in order to save Anakin's \u2013 only to awaken and discover that the battle was merely a vision, and that he has passed the test. The priestesses inform Yoda that his training will resume in time.\n\nStar Wars Rebels (2014)\nYoda was heard in the Star Wars Rebels episode \"Path of the Jedi\" with Frank Oz reprising the role for the first time since Revenge of the Sith.[24] He communicates with Padawan Ezra Bridger and his master Kanan Jarrus during their experience in an ancient temple on Lothal, and helps the pair do some soul-searching to analyze their true motivations. He appears physically for the first time, in the season 2 episode \"Shroud of Darkness\", in which he tells Ezra he should find Malachor and reunites with Ahsoka after nearly 20 years.\n\nCanon media\nYoda appears in canon books and other media, including Dooku: Jedi Lost and Master & Apprentice, which take place before The Phantom Menace. In some of these works, he is referred to as the \"Grand Master of the Jedi Order\".\n\nLegends\nWith the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.[25][26][27]\n\nClone Wars (2003)\nYoda appears in the 2003 Cartoon Network animated television series Star Wars: Clone Wars, voiced by Tom Kane. In the show, Yoda is made a general, like many of the Jedi Knights and Masters. Yoda escorts Padm\u00e9 on their journey to an unspecified planet, but Yoda senses several Jedi in distress on Ilum. Using the Jedi mind trick to convince Captain Typho to take them to Ilum, Yoda saves two Jedi Knights and finds a message from Count Dooku giving orders to destroy the Jedi Temple on Ilum. In the animated series' final episode, Yoda fights side by side with Mace Windu to defend Coruscant, which is under attack from the Separatists. The two Jedi Masters realize too late that the battle is a distraction; Separatist leader General Grievous truly intends to kidnap Palpatine. The Jedi Master's effort to stop Grievous fails, and Palpatine is taken hostage, thus setting the stage for Revenge of the Sith.\n\nLegends comics\nYoda acts as a supporting character in Dark Horse Comics' Clone Wars tie-in comic books.\n\nLegends novel Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\nMain article: Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\n\nIt has been suggested that Yoda: Dark Rendezvous be merged into this article.

It is set in the Star Wars expanded universe during the Clone Wars conflict between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.\n\nThe Clone Wars have raged across the galaxy for almost two years, when the Grand Master of the Jedi Order, Yoda, receives a message from Separatist leader Count Dooku. In the message, Dooku concedes to Yoda that things have gotten far out of hand; What began as a political play to keep the Senate honest had turned into a bloodbath, and the time for a truce has come. Dooku invites Yoda to meet him on the planet Vjun, where they would organize the cease-fire.\n\nAfter conferring with his fellow Jedi Masters from the Council, principally Mace Windu, Yoda judges that even if the meeting at Vjun were a feint, the chance to end the war far outweighs the perils of a trap. Yoda decides to send a decoy impersonating himself to a different planet, while he secretly slips off to Vjun. He contracts a famous actor and Yoda impersonator, Palleus Chuff, to pull off the bluff. Disguised as Yoda, Chuff leaves on a very public mission to Ithor. When Chuff's fighter is captured by Dooku's minion Asajj Ventress, who is unaware of the switch, the apparent loss of Yoda comes as a sad blow to the morale of the Republic.\n\nJedi Masters Jai Maruk and Maks Leem journey towards Vjun, accompanied by their Padawans, the under-achieving Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy (or \"Scout\") and Whie. They make their way slowly, travelling under the false identities of a refugee family, with Yoda disguised as their faithful R2 unit. During one Spaceport layover, Ventress (accompanied by the bumbling but brave Chuff) catches the quintet, and unleashes a dangerous new type of battle droid. While the other Jedi fight the droids and Ventress, Yoda seeks to rescue Chuff. Unfortunately, both Jai Maruk and Maks Leem fall to the terrible droids and Ventress' lightsaber. Yoda, however, diverts Ventress' attention before she gets a chance to kill the young Padawans, and the three Jedi (with Chuff in tow) escape.\n\nMeanwhile, on Vjun, Count Dooku awaits Yoda in the Ch\u00e2teau Malreaux, the manor of the long since waned aristocratic clan Malreaux. As the group of Jedi land on Vjun they are forced to separate: Yoda goes to meet with Dooku, and the Padawans follow mysterious disruptions in the Force felt by Whie. Soon, Ventress captures the Padawans. She reveals to Whie that the Ch\u00e2teau is in fact his house, and the insane house-woman was his mother, Lady \"Whirry\" Malreaux. Meanwhile, Yoda meets with Dooku, and discovers that Dooku's summons is indeed a feint. The two masters engage in a tense debate about the ways of the Force, and reminiscence about Dooku's childhood in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. In the end, Yoda encourages his former apprentice to leave the dark side and Darth Sidious forever. Dooku, hands shaking, is on the verge of answering when an assistant informs him of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi's arrival in the mansion, dispatched there by the Jedi Council, on behalf of Palpatine.\n\nConvinced that the legendary duo are replacements for him, Dooku is overcome by jealousy and throws his assistant out the window. Yoda is forced to save Whirry from falling to her death, and then parry Dooku's follow-up lightsaber attack. Even though Dooku wounds him, Yoda, unfazed, does not yield to the dark side. Yoda recovers, and a short lightsaber battle ensues. Before leaping from the window to escape, Dooku tells Yoda of a missile approaching from space, aimed at the house, and everyone in it. Yoda stops the missile, inevitably allowing Dooku and Ventress time to escape.\n\nIn popular culture\nIn 2007, Yoda was selected by Empire magazine as the \"25th greatest movie character of all time\".[28] On their list of the 100 Greatest Fictional Characters, Fandomania.com ranked Yoda at number 60.[29]\n\nYoda also appears in Disney's Star Tours: The Adventures Continue attraction, where he is voiced by his original voice actor, Frank Oz.[30]\n\nA life-size statue of Yoda greets visitors to Lucasfilm's Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco's Presidio, the headquarters of Industrial Light and Magic.\n\nAmerican musician and parody artist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic used the character as inspiration for a parody of The Kinks' \"Lola\", in a song entitled \"Yoda.\"\n\nLinguistics professor David Ager from Queen Mary University of London says Yoda's language most closely resembles the Hawaiian language.[31]\n\nIn 2019, discount store Poundland used the voice of Yoda at its self-service checkouts in stores across the United Kingdom.[32]\n\nMerchandising\n[icon]\t\nThis section needs expansion.

It consists of two [[archipelago]]s around the two main islands of [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 Island|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]] and [[Pr\u00edncipe]], about {{convert|140|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} apart and about {{convert|250|and|225|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} off the northwestern coast of [[Gabon]], respectively.\n\nThe islands were uninhabited until their discovery by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers in the 15th century. Gradually colonized and settled by the Portuguese throughout the 16th century, they collectively served as a vital commercial and trade center for the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. The rich volcanic soil and close proximity to the Equator made S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe ideal for [[sugar]] cultivation, followed later by cash crops such as [[coffee]] and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]; the lucrative plantation economy was heavily dependent upon imported African slaves. Cycles of social unrest and economic instability throughout the 19th and 20th centuries culminated in peaceful [[independence]] in 1975. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe has since remained one of [[Africa]]'s most stable and [[Democracy|democratic]] countries.\n\nWith a population of 201,800 (2018 official estimate),<ref name=\"auto\">Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica de S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe, as at 13 May 2018.</ref><ref name=\"UN_WPP\"/> S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is the second-smallest African [[sovereign state]] after [[Seychelles]], as well as the smallest Portuguese-speaking country. Its people are predominantly of African and ''[[Mesti\u00e7o#Mesti\u00e7o \u2013 S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|mesti\u00e7o]]'' descent, with most practicing [[Roman Catholicism]]. The legacy of Portuguese rule is also visible in the country's culture, customs, and music, which fuse European and African influences. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is a founding member state of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}<!-- most paragraphs have no citations-->\n\n=== Arrival of Europeans ===\n[[File:Johannes Vingboons - 't eylant St. Thome (1665).jpg|thumb|left|Map of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 by [[Johannes Vingboons]] (1665)]]\nThe islands of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe were uninhabited when the Portuguese arrived sometime around 1470. The first Europeans to put ashore were [[Jo\u00e3o de Santar\u00e9m]] and [[P\u00earo Escobar]]. Portuguese navigators explored the islands and decided that they would be good locations for bases to trade with the mainland.\n\nThe dates of European arrival are sometimes given as 21 December ([[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas's Day]]) 1471, for S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9; and 17 January ([[Anthony the Great|St Antony's Day]]) 1472, for Pr\u00edncipe, though other sources cite different years around that time. Pr\u00edncipe was initially named ''Santo Ant\u00e3o'' (\"Saint Anthony\"), changing its name in 1502 to ''Ilha do Pr\u00edncipe'' (\"Prince's Island\"), in reference to the Prince of Portugal to whom duties on the island's sugar crop were paid.\n\nThe first successful settlement of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 was established in 1493 by [[\u00c1lvaro Caminha]], who received the land as a grant from the crown. Pr\u00edncipe was settled in 1500 under a similar arrangement. Attracting settlers proved difficult, however, and most of the earliest inhabitants were \"undesirables\" sent from Portugal, mostly [[Jews]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aish.com/h/9av/aas/52421817.html |title=The Expulsion 1492 Chronicles, section XI: \"The Vale of Tears\", quoting Joseph Hacohen (1496\u20131577); also, section XVII, quoting 16th century author Samuel Usque |publisher=Aish.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2013-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003125410/http://www.aish.com/h/9av/aas/52421817.html |archive-date=2013-10-03 |url-status=live }}</ref> In time, these settlers found the volcanic soil of the region suitable for agriculture, especially the growing of sugar.\n\n=== Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe ===\nBy 1515, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe had become slave depots for the coastal slave trade centered at [[Elmina]].<ref name=\"Bakewell\">{{cite book|author=Ivor Wilks and Akan Wangara|editor=Peter John Bakewell|title=Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBhmQgAACAAJ|date=January 1997|publisher=Variorum|isbn=978-0-86078-513-2|chapter=Portuguese in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|location=Aldershot|page=24}}</ref>\n[[File:Forte_de_S%C3%A3o_Sebasti%C3%A3o_-_S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_(8084256064).jpg|thumb|left|[[S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o Museum]] in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]]\nThe cultivation of sugar was a labour-intensive process and the Portuguese began to enslave large numbers of Africans from the mainland.

In the mid-16th century, an anonymous Portuguese pilot noted that the slaves were employed as couples, built their own accommodations, and worked autonomously once a week on the cultivation of their own food supply.<ref>For an English translation, see John William Blake, trans., ed., ''Europeans in West Africa, 1450\u20131560'' (London, 1942), 145ff.</ref> However, this more relaxed slave system did not last long following the introduction of plantations.

Amador's revolt had successfully destroyed 60 of the island's 85 sugar mills in one of the greatest slave uprisings in history.<ref name=\":7\" /> Smaller slavery rebellions followed in the 17th and 18th centuries. \n\nEventually, competition from sugar-producing colonies in the [[Western Hemisphere]] began to hurt the islands. The large enslaved population also proved difficult to control, with Portugal unable to invest many resources in the effort. Sugar cultivation thus declined over the next 100 years, and by the mid-17th century, the economy of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 had changed. It was now primarily a transit point for ships engaged in the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between the West and continental Africa.\n\nIn the early 19th century, two new cash crops, coffee and cocoa, were introduced. The rich, volcanic soils proved well suited to the new cash crop industry, and soon extensive plantations (known as ''ro\u00e7as''), owned by Portuguese companies or absentee landlords, occupied almost all of the good farmland.<sup>[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> By 1908, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 had become the world's largest producer of cocoa, which remains the country's most important crop.\n\nThe ''ro\u00e7as'' system, which gave the plantation managers a high degree of authority, led to abuses against the African farm workers. Although Portugal officially abolished slavery in 1876, the practice of forced paid labour continued. ''[[Scientific American]]'' documented in words and pictures the continued use of slaves in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in its 13 March 1897 issue.\n\nIn the early 20th century, an internationally publicized controversy arose over charges that [[Angola]]n contract workers were being subjected to forced labour and unsatisfactory working conditions. Sporadic labor unrest and dissatisfaction continued well into the 20th century, culminating in an outbreak of riots in 1953 in which several hundred African laborers were killed in a clash with their Portuguese rulers. This \"[[Batep\u00e1 Massacre]]\" remains a major event in the colonial history of the islands, and its anniversary is officially observed by the government.\n\n===Independence (1975)===\n[[File:Sao_Tome_Cathedral_7_(16223085806).jpg|thumb|The cathedral of [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]]]]\nBy the late 1950s, when other emerging nations across the African continent demanded their independence, a small group of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9ans had formed the [[Movement for the Liberation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] (MLSTP), which eventually established its base in nearby [[Gabon]]. Picking up momentum in the 1960s, events moved quickly after the overthrow of the [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano]] dictatorship in Portugal in April 1974.\n\nThe new Portuguese regime was committed to the dissolution of its overseas colonies. In November 1974, their representatives met with the MLSTP in Algiers and worked out an agreement for the transfer of sovereignty. After a period of transitional government, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe achieved independence on 12 July 1975, choosing as the first president the MLSTP Secretary General [[Manuel Pinto da Costa]].\n\nIn 1990, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 became one of the first African countries to undergo [[Democratization|democratic reform]], and changes to the constitution \u2013 the legalization of opposition political parties \u2013 led to elections in 1991 that were nonviolent, free, and transparent. [[Miguel Trovoada]], a former prime minister who had been in exile since 1986, returned as an independent candidate and was elected president. Trovoada was re-elected in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's second multiparty presidential election in 1996.\n\nThe [[Democratic Convergence Party \u2013 Reflection Group|Party of Democratic Convergence]] won a majority of seats in the [[National Assembly of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|National Assembly]], with the MLSTP becoming an important and vocal minority party. Municipal elections followed in late 1992, in which the MLSTP won a majority of seats on five of seven regional councils. In early legislative elections in October 1994, the MLSTP won a plurality of seats in the assembly. It regained an outright majority of seats in the November 1998 elections.\n\nPresidential elections were held in July 2001. The candidate backed by the [[Independent Democratic Action]] party, [[Fradique de Menezes]], was elected in the first round and inaugurated on 3 September. Parliamentary elections were held in March 2002. For the next four years, a series of short-lived opposition-led governments was formed.\n\nThe army seized power for one week in July 2003, complaining of corruption and that forthcoming oil revenues would not be divided fairly. An accord was negotiated under which President de Menezes was returned to office.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} The [[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] period ended in March 2006, when a propresidential coalition won enough seats in National Assembly elections to form a new government.<ref>Gerhard Seibert (2006), ''Comrades, Clients and Cousins: Colonialism, Socialism and Democratization in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe'', Leiden: Brill.</ref>\n\nIn the 30 July 2006 presidential election, Fradique de Menezes easily won a second five-year term in office, defeating two other candidates [[Patrice Trovoada]] (son of former President Miguel Trovoada) and independent [[Nilo Guimar\u00e3es]].

At the time of independence, Portuguese-owned plantations occupied 90% of the cultivated area. After independence, control of these plantations passed to various state-owned agricultural enterprises. The main crop on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is cocoa, representing about 95% of agricultural exports. Other export crops include copra, palm kernels, and coffee.\n\nDomestic food-crop production is inadequate to meet local consumption, so the country imports most of its food.<ref name=\"AMD\">{{cite book|author1=Mary E.

The scenic islands have potential for tourism, and the government is attempting to improve its rudimentary tourist industry infrastructure. The government sector accounts for about 11% of employment.\n\nFollowing independence, the country had a centrally directed economy, with most means of production owned and controlled by the state. The original constitution guaranteed a [[mixed economy]], with privately owned cooperatives combined with publicly owned property and means of production.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the economy of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 encountered major difficulties. Economic growth stagnated, and cocoa exports dropped in both value and volume, creating large balance-of-payments deficits. Plantation land was seized, resulting in the complete collapse of cocoa production. At the same time, the international price of cocoa slumped.\n\nIn response to its economic downturn, the government undertook a series of far-reaching economic reforms. In 1987, the government implemented an [[International Monetary Fund]] [[structural adjustment]] program, and invited greater private participation in management of the [[State-owned enterprise|parastatal]]s, as well as in the agricultural, commercial, banking, and tourism sectors. The focus of economic reform since the early 1990s has been widespread privatization, especially of the state-run agricultural and industrial sectors.\n\nThe S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an government has traditionally obtained foreign assistance from various donors, including the [[United Nations Development Programme|UN Development Programme]], the [[World Bank]], the European Union, Portugal, [[Taiwan]], and the [[African Development Bank]]. In April 2000, in association with the [[Central Bank of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|Banco Central de S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe]], the IMF approved a poverty-reduction and growth facility for S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 aimed at reducing inflation to 3% for 2001, raising ideal growth to 4%, and reducing the fiscal deficit.\n\nIn late 2000, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 qualified for significant debt reduction under the IMF\u2013World Bank's [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] initiative.
