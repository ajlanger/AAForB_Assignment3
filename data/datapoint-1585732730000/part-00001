Modern linguists generally agree that there is little difference between the two, mainly in accent and vocabulary. The republic also promoted [[irredentism]] towards Romania, proclaiming that the Moldavians in Bessarabia were \"oppressed by Romanian imperialists\".\n\nAs part of the effort to keep the language in Soviet Moldavia (\"Moldavian Socialist culture\") far from Romanian influences (\"Romanian bourgeois culture\"), a [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet|reformed Cyrillic script]] was used to write the language, in contrast with the [[Romanian alphabet|Latin script]] officially used in Romania. The linguist [[Leonid Madan]] was assigned the task of establishing a literary standard, based on the Moldavian dialects of Transnistria and Bessarabia, as well as Russian loanwords or Russian-based [[calque]].\n\nIn 1932, when in the entire Soviet Union there was a trend to move all languages to the [[Latin script]], the Latin script and literary Romanian language was introduced in Moldavian schools and public use. Madan's books were removed from libraries and destroyed. This movement, however, was short lived, and in the second half of the 1940s a new trend of moving languages to the Cyrillic script started in the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1937, during the Soviet [[Great Purge]], many{{vague|date=April 2010}} intellectuals in the Moldavian ASSR, accused of being [[enemies of the people]], bourgeois nationalist or [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], were removed from their positions and repressed, with a large number of them executed. In 1938 the Cyrillic script was again declared official for the [[Moldavian language]] and the Latin script was banned. However, the literary language did not fully return to Madan's creation and remained closer to Romanian. After 1956, Madan's influences were entirely dropped from school books.\n\nThis policy remained in effect until 1989. Use of Cyrillic is still enforced in Moldova's breakaway region of [[Transnistria]], where it is claimed to be returning the language to its roots.\n\n{{Administrative division of the Ukrainian SSR}}\n{{History of Moldova}}\n==Disbanding==\nOn June 26, 1940 the Soviet government issued an ultimatum to the Romanian minister in Moscow, demanding Romania to immediately cede [[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Bukovina]].<ref name=\"CKing\">[[Charles King (professor of international affairs)|Charles King]], ''The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture'', Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8179-9792-X}}.</ref> [[Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], which needed a stable Romania and access to its oil fields urged [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] to comply.

The linguist [[Leonid Madan]] was assigned the task of establishing a literary standard, based on the Moldavian dialects of Transnistria and Bessarabia, as well as Russian loanwords or Russian-based [[calque]].\n\nIn 1932, when in the entire Soviet Union there was a trend to move all languages to the [[Latin script]], the Latin script and literary Romanian language was introduced in Moldavian schools and public use. Madan's books were removed from libraries and destroyed. This movement, however, was short lived, and in the second half of the 1940s a new trend of moving languages to the Cyrillic script started in the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1937, during the Soviet [[Great Purge]], many{{vague|date=April 2010}} intellectuals in the Moldavian ASSR, accused of being [[enemies of the people]], bourgeois nationalist or [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], were removed from their positions and repressed, with a large number of them executed. In 1938 the Cyrillic script was again declared official for the [[Moldavian language]] and the Latin script was banned. However, the literary language did not fully return to Madan's creation and remained closer to Romanian. After 1956, Madan's influences were entirely dropped from school books.\n\nThis policy remained in effect until 1989. Use of Cyrillic is still enforced in Moldova's breakaway region of [[Transnistria]], where it is claimed to be returning the language to its roots.\n\n{{Administrative division of the Ukrainian SSR}}\n{{History of Moldova}}\n==Disbanding==\nOn June 26, 1940 the Soviet government issued an ultimatum to the Romanian minister in Moscow, demanding Romania to immediately cede [[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Bukovina]].<ref name=\"CKing\">[[Charles King (professor of international affairs)|Charles King]], ''The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture'', Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8179-9792-X}}.</ref> [[Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], which needed a stable Romania and access to its oil fields urged [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] to comply.
