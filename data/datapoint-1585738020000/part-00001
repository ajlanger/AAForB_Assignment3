With the end of the [[American Civil War]] in the 1860s, many discharged veterans returning home began hopping freight trains. Others looking for work on the [[American frontier]] followed the railways west aboard freight trains in the late 19th century.\n\nIn 1906, Professor Layal Shafee, after an exhaustive study, put the number of tramps in the United States at about 500,000 (about 0.6% of the US population at the time). His article \"What Tramps Cost Nation\" was published by ''The New York Telegraph'' in 1911, when he estimated the number had surged to 700,000.<ref>''The New York Telegraph'': \"What Tramps Cost Nation\", page D2.

Many listings of these symbols have been made. A few symbols include (see also photo at right):\n* A triangle with hands, signifying that the homeowner has a gun.<ref name=\"university\">Moon, Gypsy: \"Done and Been\", page 198. Indiana University Press, 1996.</ref>\n* A horizontal zigzag signifying a barking dog.<ref name=\"Moon\">Moon, Gypsy: \"Done and Been\", page 24.

The alternative hypothesis is that the signs were invented early on by a writer or writers seeking to add to the fantastical mythos that began to surround hoboes soon after they first appeared; this fabrication, then, was perpetuated and embellished by writers over the years, aided occasionally by hoboes willing to make up a colorful story or pose for a photo.<ref name=\":1\" /> Several hoboes during the days that the signs were reportedly most in use asserted that they were in fact a \"popular fancy\" or \"a fabrication\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.historicgraffiti.org/post/hobo-signs-code-of-the-road|title=Hobo Signs: Code of the Road?|last=Wray|first=Mike|last2=Wray|first2=Charlie|date=2018|website=Historic Graffiti Society|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> Nels Anderson, who both hoboed himself and studied hoboes extensively for a [[University of Chicago]] master's thesis,<ref name=\":1\" /> wrote in 1932,<blockquote>Another merit of the book [Godfrey Irwin's 1931 ''American Tramp and Underworld Slang''] is that the author has not subscribed to the fiction that American tramps have a sign language, as so many professors are wont to believe.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Nels|date=March 1932|title=American Tramp and Underworld Slang.

These generally consisted simply of a road name (moniker), a date, and the direction the hobo was heading then. This would be written in a prominent location where other hoboes would see it. [[Jack London]], in recounting his hobo days, wrote,<blockquote>Water-tanks are tramp directories. Not all in idle wantonness do tramps carve their monicas, dates, and courses. Often and often have I met hoboes earnestly inquiring if I had seen anywhere such and such a \"stiff\" or his monica. And more than once I have been able to give the monica of recent date, the water-tank, and the direction in which he was then bound. And promptly the hobo to whom I gave the information lit out after his pal. I have met hoboes who, in trying to catch a pal, had pursued clear across the continent and back again, and were still going.<ref>{{Cite book|last=London|first=Jack|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14658/14658-h/14658-h.htm|title=The Road|publisher=Project Gutenberg|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|orig-year=1907}}</ref></blockquote>The use of monikers persists to this day, although since the rise of cell phones a moniker is more often used simply to \"tag\" a train car or location. Some moniker writers have tagged train cars extensively; one who tagged under the name Bozo Texino during the 1970s and \u201980s estimated that in one year (\"where I went overboard\") he marked over 30,000 train cars.<ref name=\":2\">Daniel, Bill.

Hobo culture's ethics have always been subject to disapproval from the mainstream culture; for example, hopping freight trains, an integral part of hobo life, has always been illegal in the U.S. Nonetheless, the ethics of hobo culture can be regarded as fairly coherent and internally consistent, at least to the extent that any culture's various individual people maintain the same ethical standards. That is to say, any attempt at an exhaustive enumeration of hobo ethics is bound to be foiled at least to some extent by the diversity of hobos and their ideas of the world. This difficulty has not kept hobos themselves from attempting the exercise.

With the end of the [[American Civil War]] in the 1860s, many discharged veterans returning home began hopping freight trains. Others looking for work on the [[American frontier]] followed the railways west aboard freight trains in the late 19th century.\n\nIn 1906, Professor Layal Shafee, after an exhaustive study, put the number of tramps in the United States at about 500,000 (about 0.6% of the US population at the time). His article \"What Tramps Cost Nation\" was published by ''The New York Telegraph'' in 1911, when he estimated the number had surged to 700,000.<ref>''The New York Telegraph'': \"What Tramps Cost Nation\", page D2.

Many listings of these symbols have been made. A few symbols include (see also photo at right):\n* A triangle with hands, signifying that the homeowner has a gun.<ref name=\"university\">Moon, Gypsy: \"Done and Been\", page 198.

The alternative hypothesis is that the signs were invented early on by a writer or writers seeking to add to the fantastical mythos that began to surround hoboes soon after they first appeared; this fabrication, then, was perpetuated and embellished by writers over the years, aided occasionally by hoboes willing to make up a colorful story or pose for a photo.<ref name=\":1\" /> Several hoboes during the days that the signs were reportedly most in use asserted that they were in fact a \"popular fancy\" or \"a fabrication\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.historicgraffiti.org/post/hobo-signs-code-of-the-road|title=Hobo Signs: Code of the Road?|last=Wray|first=Mike|last2=Wray|first2=Charlie|date=2018|website=Historic Graffiti Society|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> Nels Anderson, who both hoboed himself and studied hoboes extensively for a [[University of Chicago]] master's thesis,<ref name=\":1\" /> wrote in 1932,<blockquote>Another merit of the book [Godfrey Irwin's 1931 ''American Tramp and Underworld Slang''] is that the author has not subscribed to the fiction that American tramps have a sign language, as so many professors are wont to believe.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Nels|date=March 1932|title=American Tramp and Underworld Slang.

These generally consisted simply of a road name (moniker), a date, and the direction the hobo was heading then. This would be written in a prominent location where other hoboes would see it. [[Jack London]], in recounting his hobo days, wrote,<blockquote>Water-tanks are tramp directories. Not all in idle wantonness do tramps carve their monicas, dates, and courses. Often and often have I met hoboes earnestly inquiring if I had seen anywhere such and such a \"stiff\" or his monica. And more than once I have been able to give the monica of recent date, the water-tank, and the direction in which he was then bound. And promptly the hobo to whom I gave the information lit out after his pal. I have met hoboes who, in trying to catch a pal, had pursued clear across the continent and back again, and were still going.<ref>{{Cite book|last=London|first=Jack|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14658/14658-h/14658-h.htm|title=The Road|publisher=Project Gutenberg|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|orig-year=1907}}</ref></blockquote>The use of monikers persists to this day, although since the rise of cell phones a moniker is more often used simply to \"tag\" a train car or location. Some moniker writers have tagged train cars extensively; one who tagged under the name Bozo Texino during the 1970s and \u201980s estimated that in one year (\"where I went overboard\") he marked over 30,000 train cars.<ref name=\":2\">Daniel, Bill.

Hobo culture's ethics have always been subject to disapproval from the mainstream culture; for example, hopping freight trains, an integral part of hobo life, has always been illegal in the U.S. Nonetheless, the ethics of hobo culture can be regarded as fairly coherent and internally consistent, at least to the extent that any culture's various individual people maintain the same ethical standards. That is to say, any attempt at an exhaustive enumeration of hobo ethics is bound to be foiled at least to some extent by the diversity of hobos and their ideas of the world. This difficulty has not kept hobos themselves from attempting the exercise.
