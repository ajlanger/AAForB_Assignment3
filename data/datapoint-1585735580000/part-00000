He is known for his ability to adapt to a variety of genres, and both his [[ambidextrous]] and his [[open-handed drumming]] styles. He plays the drums and sings backing vocals in the band. Beauford was ranked number 10 by a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine reader's poll in 2010 for greatest drummers of all-time.<ref name=\"RS greatest drummers poll\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/staff-blog/readers-rock-list-best-drummers-20100208 |title=Readers' Rock List: Best Drummers |date=February 8, 2010 |publisher=Rolling Stone magazine |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413094911/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/staff-blog/readers-rock-list-best-drummers-20100208 |archivedate=April 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nBeauford was first exposed to the drums at age three. At the time, his father had bought tickets to a [[Buddy Rich]] concert and could not find someone to watch his son, so he took young Beauford along to the show. Beauford was mesmerized by Buddy Rich on stage.  After that show, Beauford's father bought his son a tin drum set with paper heads, since Beauford showed so much interest in learning the instrument. Beauford began performing professionally when he was nine.<ref name=\"official website1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.davematthewsband.com/#/band|title=Carter Beauford|year=2009|publisher=Official DMB website|accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>\n\nBeauford explains his unusual playing style in his instructional video \"Under The Table & Drumming\", attributing his use of left-hand-lead on a right-handed kit to playing his own kit in front of a mirror as a child in an attempt to emulate his favorite drummers, like [[Buddy Rich]]. He unknowingly set up his drums in reverse of whichever performer and set that he had in mind, in an attempt to make the mirrored image of himself match that of the audience's perspective, as he had seen it on stage and TV. This helped him to become completely [[ambidextrous]] at a very early age, albeit by accident.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n=== Secrets, Dave Matthews Band ===\n[[File:TATM DMB 1998 - picture 2.jpg|thumb|Members from [[Toots and the Maytals|Toots & the Maytals]] and [[Dave Matthews Band]] when performing together in 1998.

Other members included childhood friend and next-door neighbor saxophonist [[LeRoi Moore]], trumpeter [[John D'earth]], vocalist Dawn Thompson, bassist Keith Horne, keyboardist [[Butch Taylor]], keyboardist Dane Bryant, saxophonist Eddie Williams and [[Virtuoso|virtuoso guitarist]] [[Tim Reynolds]].  Secrets performed throughout Virginia, at places such as The Jewish Mother in Virginia Beach, and at Miller's, the bar in Charlottesville where [[Dave Matthews]] worked as a [[bartender]]. Beauford also played [[jazz]] in Blue Indigo with LeRoi Moore, [[Sal Soghoian]], and George Melvin. Blue Indigo performed regularly at Tokyo Rose and Miller's, and was featured at the [[Celebration of the Arts Festival|Delaware Water Gap Jazz Festival]]. Eventually, Matthews approached both Beauford and Moore regarding some music he had written that he wished to record. Beauford agreed to perform on a demo, which is how he became involved with the group that was to become the Dave Matthews Band.\n\n== Collaboration ==\nBeauford has also worked with other artists on [[Jam session|jam]] projects, including [[Vertical Horizon]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Rashawn Ross]], [[John Popper]] (of [[Blues Traveler]]), [[Tim Reynolds]], [[B\u00e9la Fleck]] and [[Victor Wooten]]; both alone and within [[B\u00e9la Fleck and the Flecktones]].<ref name=\"Allmusic1\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=carter-beauford-p147832/credits|pure_url=yes}}|title=Carter Beauford|last=Griffith|first=J.T.|year=2010|work=All Music review|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:Carter Beauford.jpg|thumb|180px|Beauford behind his drum kit with the Dave Matthews Band]]\nBeauford uses a [[Yamaha Drums]] Recording Custom drum kit, a [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig]] Alex Van Halen Signature Rosewood snare drum, 6.5x14\" with a die-cast hoop on the batter side and a triple flanged hoop snare side, [[Zildjian]] cymbals, [[Remo]] drumheads, Vic Firth sticks and mallets, [[Yamaha]] and [[Drum Workshop]] hardware including a [[Yamaha]] Hex-Rack since the 2008 Summer Tour and various [[Latin Percussion]] [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]]s, [[Woodblock (instrument)|woodblocks]] and other assorted percussion equipment.
