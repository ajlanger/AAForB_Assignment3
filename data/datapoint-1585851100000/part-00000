On 12 May 1965, Marijnen was nominated as the first [[Rijnmond|Chairman of the Rijnmond Council]], a [[direct election|direct electable]] sub national administrative layer between the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipalities]] and the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|provinces]] in the [[Rijnmond|Rijnmond Area]], taking office on 20 May 1965.

In 1941 he graduated in law from the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] and went on to work in the accountancy divisions of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality]]. In 1945 he was seconded to the Council for the Restitution of Legal Rights.\n\nIn 1949 Marijnen became secretary of the Agricultural Society and in 1951 Secretary-General of the Foreign Agricultural Trade Department of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality]]. From 1957 he was secretary of the General Catholic Employers Association and the Catholic Federation of Employers Associations.\n\n[[File:Lyndon B Johnson in Holland De vice-president en premier Marijnen op Ypenburg, Bestanddeelnr 915-7144.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Prime Minister Victor Marijnen and [[Vice President of the United States]] [[Lyndon B.

According to the ''Telegraph'' newspaper, reporting in March 2012, he \"intervened to have prison sentences dropped against several priests convicted of abusing children.\"<ref name=\"Protecting paedophile priests\">{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/9153676/Dutch-Roman-Catholic-Church-castrated-at-least-10-boys.html | title=Dutch Roman Catholic Church 'castrated at least 10 boys' | publisher=Telegraph | accessdate=March 19, 2012}}</ref> The Dutch Catholic Church organised the [[castration]] of Heithuis while he lived at the Gelderland children's home in 1956 after he reported being sexually abused to the police.<ref name=\"Protecting paedophile priests\"/>\n\n===Politics===\nIn the [[De Quay cabinet]], Marijnen was [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality|Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries]]. He served as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] from 24 July 1963 until 14 April 1965. \n\nThe [[natural gas]] reserves, recently found in [[Slochteren]] were a considerable boost for the economy. This, combined with [[labour shortage]] led to a rise in wages and the attraction of foreign workers. Despite this being the second cabinet without socialist [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]], the building up of a [[welfare state]], that was started after [[World War II]], continued with the introduction of [[minimum wages]] in 1964 and the [[Universal health care|national health service]]. In 1965, measures were taken against [[commercial television]] stations transmitting from the [[North Sea]]. The cabinet finally fell over the issue if commercial TV should be allowed in the Netherlands.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1966 Marijnen was a member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] and concurrently chairman of the Board of the Rijnmond Authority. In 1967 he was also appointed chairman of the Post and Telecommunications Council. On 16 October 1968 he was selected [[List of mayors of The Hague|Mayor of The Hague]].\n\nMarijnen died on 5 April 1975 in [[The Hague]], while serving as Mayor from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 58.\n\n==Decorations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=5 |'''Honours'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Ribbon bar !!
