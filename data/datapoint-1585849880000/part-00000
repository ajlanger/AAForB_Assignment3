Perforated paper tapes were first used by [[Basile Bouchon]] in 1725 to control looms. However, the paper tapes were expensive to create, fragile, and difficult to repair. By 1801, [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] had developed machines to create paper tapes by tying punched cards in a sequence for [[Jacquard loom]]s. The resulting paper tape, also called a \"chain of cards\", was stronger and simpler both to create and to repair.\n\nThis led to the concept of communicating data not as a stream of individual cards, but as one \"continuous card\" (or tape). Many professional [[embroidery]] operations still refer to those individuals who create the designs and machine patterns as \"punchers\" even though punched cards and paper tape were eventually phased out in the 1990s. In 1842, a French patent by Claude Seytre described a [[Player piano|piano playing device]] that read data from [[Piano roll|perforated paper rolls]].\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] used punched tape to send [[telegrams]].

The tape, punched with the keyboard, was later read by the caster, which produced lead type according to the combinations of holes in 0, 1, or more of 31 positions. The tape reader used compressed air, which passed through the holes and was directed into certain mechanisms of the caster. The system went into commercial use in 1897 and was in production well into the 1970s, undergoing several changes along the way.\n\n==Tape formats==\n[[File:Harvard Mark I program tape.agr.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A 24-channel program tape for the [[Harvard Mark I]] ]]\n\nData were represented by the presence or absence of a hole at a particular location.

In the early 1960s, the [[American Standards Association]] led a project to develop a universal code for data processing, which became known as [[ASCII]]. This seven-level code was adopted by some teleprinter users, including [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] ([[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]]). Others, such as [[teleprinter|Telex]], stayed with the earlier codes.\n\n===Dimensions===\nTape for punching was 0.00394 inches (0.1&nbsp;mm) thick. The two most common widths were 11/16 inch (17.46&nbsp;mm) for five bit codes, and 1 inch (25.4&nbsp;mm) for tapes with six or more bits. Hole spacing was 0.1 inch (2.54&nbsp;mm) in both directions. Data holes were 0.072 inches (1.83&nbsp;mm) in diameter; feed holes were 0.046 inches (1.17&nbsp;mm).\n\n===Chadless tape===\nMost tape-punching equipment used solid punches to create holes in the tape. This process created \"[[chad (paper)|chad]]\", or small circular pieces of paper. Managing the disposal of chad was an annoying and complex problem, as the tiny paper pieces had a tendency to escape and interfere with the other electromechanical parts of the teleprinter equipment.\n\n[[File:1980-Paper Tape fromTeletype (chadless, 5-level Baudot)-02.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Chadless paper tape|Chadless 5-level Baudot paper tape circa ~1975\u20131980 punched at Teletype Corp.]]\nA variation on the tape punch was a device called a ''Chadless Printing Reperforator''. This machine would punch a received teleprinter signal into tape and print the message on it at the same time, using a printing mechanism similar to that of an ordinary page printer. The tape punch, rather than punching out the usual round holes, would instead punch little U-shaped cuts in the paper, so that no [[chad (paper)|chad]] would be produced; the \"hole\" was still filled with a little paper trap-door. By not fully punching out the hole, the printing on the paper remained intact and legible. This enabled operators to read the tape without having to decipher the holes, which would facilitate relaying the message on to another station in the network. Also, there was no \"chad box\" to empty from time to time. A disadvantage to this mechanism was that chadless tape, once punched, did not roll up well, because the protruding flaps of paper would catch on the next layer of tape, so it could not be rolled up tightly. Another disadvantage, as seen over time, was that there was no reliable way to read chadless tape by optical means employed by later high-speed readers. However, the mechanical tape readers used in most standard-speed equipment had no problem with chadless tape, because it sensed the holes by means of blunt spring-loaded sensing pins, which easily pushed the paper flaps out of the way.\n\n[[File:Papertape-Wikipedia-example-dark1.svg|thumb|200px|The word \"Wikipedia\", and a [[Newline|CR/LF]] as 7-bit ASCII, without a parity bit, [[least significant bit]] on the right - e.g. \"W\" is 1010111]]\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Communications===\n[[Image:Honolulu IFSS Teletype1964.faa.jpg|thumb|Paper tape relay operation at US [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]'s Honolulu flight service station in 1964]]\nPunched tape was used as a way of storing messages for [[Teleprinter|teletypewriters]]. Operators typed in the message to the paper tape, and then sent the message at the maximum line speed from the tape. This permitted the operator to prepare the message \"off-line\" at the operator's best typing speed, and permitted the operator to correct any error prior to transmission. An experienced operator could prepare a message at 135 words per minute (WPM) or more for short periods.\n\nThe line typically operated at 75WPM, but it operated continuously. By preparing the tape \"off-line\" and then sending the message with a tape reader, the line could operate continuously rather than depending on continuous \"on-line\" typing by a single operator. Typically, a single 75WPM line supported three or more teletype operators working offline. Tapes punched at the receiving end could be used to relay messages to another station. Large [[store and forward]] networks were developed using these techniques.\n\nPaper tape could be read into computers at up to 1,000 characters per second.<ref>{{Citation | last = Hult | first = Ture | title = Presentation of a new high speed paper tape reader | journal = BIT Numerical Mathematics | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 93\u201396 | year = 1963 | doi = 10.1007/BF01935575 }}</ref> In 1963, a Danish company called [[Regnecentralen]] introduced a paper tape reader called RC 2000 that could read 2,000 characters per second; later they increased the speed further, up to 2,500 cps. As early as [[World War II]], the [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)#Tape reading|Heath Robinson tape reader]], used by Allied codebreakers, was capable of 2,000&nbsp;cps while [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] could run at 5,000 cps using an optical tape reader designed by Arnold Lynch.\n\n===Minicomputers===\n[[File:Dg-papertapes.jpg|thumb|left|Software on fanfold paper tape for the [[Data General Nova]] minicomputer]]\n\nWhen the first [[minicomputer]]s were being released, most manufacturers turned to the existing mass-produced [[ASCII]] [[teleprinter]]s (primarily the [[Teletype Model 33]], capable of ten ASCII characters per second throughput) as a low-cost solution for keyboard input and printer output. The commonly specified Model 33 ASR included a paper tape punch/reader, where ASR stands for \"Automatic Send/Receive\" as opposed to the punchless/readerless KSR \u2013 [[Keyboard Send Receive|Keyboard Send/Receive]] and RO \u2013 Receive Only models. As a side effect, punched tape became a popular medium for low-cost minicomputer data and program storage, and it was common to find a selection of tapes containing useful programs in most minicomputer installations. Faster optical readers were also common.\n\nBinary data transfer to or from these [[minicomputer]]s was often accomplished using a doubly encoded technique to compensate for the relatively high error rate of punches and readers. The low-level encoding was typically ASCII, further encoded and framed in various schemes such as [[Intel Hex]], in which a binary value of \"01011010\" would be represented by the ASCII characters \"5A\". Framing, addressing and [[checksum]] (primarily in ASCII hex characters) information helped with error detection. Efficiencies of such an encoding scheme are on the order of 35\u201340% (e.g., 36% from 44 8-bit ASCII characters being needed to represent sixteen [[byte]]s of binary data per frame).\n<!--{{clear}}-->\n\n===Data transfer for ROM and EPROM programming===\nIn the 1970s through the early 1980s, paper tape was commonly used to transfer binary data for incorporation in either mask-programmable [[Read-only memory|read-only memory (ROM)]] chips or their erasable counterparts \u2013 [[EPROM]]s. A significant variety of encoding formats were developed for use in computer and ROM/EPROM data transfer.<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dataio.com/main/Manuals/UniFam/Translation%20Formats.pdf |title=Translation File Formats |publisher=Data I/O Corporation |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref> Encoding formats commonly used were primarily driven by those formats that EPROM programming devices supported and included various ASCII hex variants as well as a number of proprietary formats.\n\nA much more primitive as well as a much longer high-level encoding scheme was also used \u2013 [[BNPF]] (Begin-Negative-Positive-Finish). In BNPF encoding, a single [[byte]] (8 bits) would be represented by a highly redundant character framing sequence starting with a single ASCII \"B\", eight ASCII characters where a \"0\" would be represented by a \"N\" and a \"1\" would be represented by a \"P\", followed by an ending ASCII \"F\". These ten-character ASCII sequences were separated by one or more [[whitespace character]]s, therefore using at least eleven ASCII characters for each byte stored (9% efficiency). The ASCII \"N\" and \"P\" characters differ in four bit positions, providing excellent protection from single punch errors. Alternative schemes were also available where \"L\" and \"H\" or \"0\" and \"1\" were also available to represent data bits, but in both of these encoding schemes, the two data-bearing ASCII characters differ in only one bit position, providing very poor single punch error detection.\n\n===Cash registers===\n[[NCR Corporation|NCR]] of [[Dayton, Ohio]], made cash registers around 1970 that would punch paper tape. [[Sweda]] made similar cash registers around the same time. The tape could then be read into a computer and not only could sales information be summarized, billings could be done on charge transactions. The tape was also used for inventory tracking, recording department and class numbers of items sold.\n\n===Newspaper industry===\nPunched paper tape was used by the newspaper industry until the mid-1970s or later. Newspapers were typically set in hot lead by devices like [[linotype machine]]s. With the wire services coming into a device that would punch paper tape, rather than the linotype operator having to retype all the incoming stories, the paper tape could be put into a paper tape reader on the linotype and it would create the lead slugs without the operator re-typing the stories. This also allowed newspapers to use devices, such as the [[Friden Flexowriter]], to convert typing to lead type via tape. Even after the demise of the Linotype/hot lead, many early \"offset\" devices had paper tape readers on them to produce the news-story copy.\n\nIf an error was found at one position on the six-level tape, that character could be turned into a null character to be skipped by punching out the remaining non-punched positions with what was known as a \u201cchicken plucker\". It looked like a strawberry stem remover that, pressed with thumb and forefinger, could punch out the remaining positions, one hole at a time.\n\n===Automated machinery===\n[[File:Paper tape reader on a CNC control 001.jpg|thumb|Paper tape reader on a [[Numerical control|computer numerical control]] (CNC) machine]]\n\nIn the 1970s, [[computer-aided manufacturing]] equipment often used paper tape. Paper tape was an important storage medium for computer-controlled [[wire-wrap]] machines, for example. A paper tape reader was smaller and less expensive than [[hollerith card]] or [[magnetic tape]] readers. Premium black waxed and lubricated long-fiber papers, and [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|Mylar film]] tape were invented so that production tapes for these machines would last longer.\n\n===Cryptography===\n[[Gilbert Vernam|Vernam ciphers]] were invented in 1917 to encrypt [[teleprinter]] communications using a key stored on paper tape. During the last third of the 20th century, the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) used punched paper tape to distribute [[key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]]. The eight-level paper tapes were distributed under strict accounting controls and read by a [[fill device]], such as the hand held [[KOI-18]], that was temporarily connected to each security device that needed new keys. NSA has been trying to replace this method with a more secure electronic key management system ([[EKMS]]), but as of 2016, paper tape is apparently still being employed.<ref name=taleoftape>[https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/misc/tale-of-the-tape.shtml Tale of the Tape], NSA/CSS, May 3, 2016, Accessed June 16, 2014</ref> The paper tape canister is a [[tamper-resistant]] container that contains features to prevent undetected alteration of the contents. \n[[File:Papertape2.jpg|thumb|Fanfold paper tape]]\n\n==Limitations==\nThe three biggest problems with paper tape were:\n* Reliability. It was common practice to follow each mechanical copying of a tape with a manual hole-by-hole comparison.\n* Rewinding the tape was difficult and prone to problems. Great care was needed to avoid tearing the tape{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. Some systems used ''fanfold'' paper tape rather than rolled paper tape. In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy supply reel, takeup reel, or tension arm mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the takeup tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.\n* Low information density. Datasets much larger than a few dozen kilobytes are impractical to handle in paper tape format.\n\n==Advantages==\nPunched tape does have some useful properties:\n* Longevity. Although many [[magnetic tape]]s have deteriorated over time to the point that the data on them has been irretrievably lost, punched tape can be read many decades later, if [[acid-free paper]] or Mylar film is used. Some paper can degrade rapidly.\n* Human accessibility.  The hole patterns can be decoded visually if necessary, and torn tape can be repaired (using special all-hole pattern tape splices). Editing text on a punched tape was achieved by literally cutting and pasting the tape with scissors, glue, or by taping over a section to cover all holes and making new holes using a manual hole punch.\n* Magnetic field immunity. In a [[machine shop]] full of powerful electric motors, the [[numerical control]] programs need to survive the magnetic fields generated by those motors.<ref>\n{{cite book |first=N.K. |last=Sinha |title=Microprocessor-Based Control Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgalRre0L8wC&pg=PA264 |date=30 June 1986 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-277-2287-4 |pages=264 |quote=\"Paper tape is well suited to a machine shop environment whereas magnetic tape may be accidentally erased or contaminated by foreign substances. ...&nbsp;Other disadvantages of paper tape are as follows&nbsp;...\"}}</ref><!--<ref>[http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=72469 \"computer programming punch paper tape\"]: \"Factory computer numerical control (CNC) equipment used paper tape well into the 1980s\"</ref>-->\n* Ease of destruction.  In the case of cryptographic keys, the inherent flammability (sometimes enhanced by using flash paper) of paper tape was an asset.  Once the key had been loaded into the device, the paper tape could simply be burned, preventing the key from falling into enemy hands.\n\n==Punched tape in art==\n\nA computing or telecommunications professional depicted in the [[Monument to the Conquerors of Space]] in Moscow (1964) holds what appears to be a punched tape with three rows of rectangular holes.\n\n==Current use==\nNowadays punched tape use is very rare. It may still be used in older military systems{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} and by some hobbyists. In [[Numerical control|computer numerical control]] (CNC) machining applications, very few people still use tape. However, some modern CNC systems still measure the size of stored CNC programs in feet or meters, corresponding to the equivalent length if punched on paper tape.<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Smid |title= CNC Control Setup for Milling and Turning: Mastering CNC Control Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2ev3yYwvq0C&pg=PA20 |year=2010 |publisher=Industrial Press |isbn= 978-0-8311-3350-4 |pages=20}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bit bucket]]\n* [[Book music]]\n* [[Key punch]]\n* [[Music roll]]\n* [[Tape library]]\n* [[Zygalski sheets]] \u2013 a system used to decrypt messages enciphered on German [[Enigma machine]]s\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Punched tapes}}\n* {{cite web |first= |last= |title=ECMA standard for Data Interchange on Punched Tape |date=November 1965 |id=ECMA-10 |publisher=European Computer Manufacturers Association |url=http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~jsm28/ECMA-10/}}\n* [http://www.poppyfields.net/filks/00124.html A song mentioning paper tape]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040408201444/http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/punched.html Various punched media]\n* [http://blinkenlights.com/classiccmp/friden/ Friden Flexowriter] combination typewriter, [[paper tape]] punch, and paper tape reader, designed by IBM during the 1940s and bought out by [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] in the late 1950s (Retrieved April 10, 2007)\n* [http://www.technikum29.de/de/geraete/olympia-schreibautomat.shtm Olympia Flexowriter]\n* [http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/39/394.html Detailed description of two paper tape code systems], [[Baudot code]] and the system used by the [[ILLIAC]] computer\n*Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U9-gFkPVwM Working paper tape punch/reader GNT 3601], [[Mus\u00e9e Bolo]], YouTube\n\n\n\n{{Paper data storage media}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Punched Tape}}\n[[Category:Computer storage tape media]]\n[[Category:History of computing]]\n[[Category:Telegraphy]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:PaperTapes-5and8Hole.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Five- and eight-hole punched paper tape]]\n[[File:Harwell-dekatron-witch-10.jpg|right|thumb|Paper tape reader on an [[Harwell computer|early computer]] with a small piece of five-hole tape connected in a circle \u2013 creating a physical program loop]]\n\n'''Punched tape''' or '''perforated paper tape''' is a form of [[data storage device|data storage]] that consists of a long strip of paper in which holes are punched.

By preparing the tape \"off-line\" and then sending the message with a tape reader, the line could operate continuously rather than depending on continuous \"on-line\" typing by a single operator. Typically, a single 75WPM line supported three or more teletype operators working offline. Tapes punched at the receiving end could be used to relay messages to another station. Large [[store and forward]] networks were developed using these techniques.\n\nPaper tape could be read into computers at up to 1,000 characters per second.<ref>{{Citation | last = Hult | first = Ture | title = Presentation of a new high speed paper tape reader | journal = BIT Numerical Mathematics | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 93\u201396 | year = 1963 | doi = 10.1007/BF01935575 }}</ref> In 1963, a Danish company called [[Regnecentralen]] introduced a paper tape reader called RC 2000 that could read 2,000 characters per second; later they increased the speed further, up to 2,500 cps. As early as [[World War II]], the [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)#Tape reading|Heath Robinson tape reader]], used by Allied codebreakers, was capable of 2,000&nbsp;cps while [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] could run at 5,000 cps using an optical tape reader designed by Arnold Lynch.\n\n===Minicomputers===\n[[File:Dg-papertapes.jpg|thumb|left|Software on fanfold paper tape for the [[Data General Nova]] minicomputer]]\n\nWhen the first [[minicomputer]]s were being released, most manufacturers turned to the existing mass-produced [[ASCII]] [[teleprinter]]s (primarily the [[Teletype Model 33]], capable of ten ASCII characters per second throughput) as a low-cost solution for keyboard input and printer output. The commonly specified Model 33 ASR included a paper tape punch/reader, where ASR stands for \"Automatic Send/Receive\" as opposed to the punchless/readerless KSR \u2013 [[Keyboard Send Receive|Keyboard Send/Receive]] and RO \u2013 Receive Only models. As a side effect, punched tape became a popular medium for low-cost minicomputer data and program storage, and it was common to find a selection of tapes containing useful programs in most minicomputer installations. Faster optical readers were also common.\n\nBinary data transfer to or from these [[minicomputer]]s was often accomplished using a doubly encoded technique to compensate for the relatively high error rate of punches and readers. The low-level encoding was typically ASCII, further encoded and framed in various schemes such as [[Intel Hex]], in which a binary value of \"01011010\" would be represented by the ASCII characters \"5A\". Framing, addressing and [[checksum]] (primarily in ASCII hex characters) information helped with error detection. Efficiencies of such an encoding scheme are on the order of 35\u201340% (e.g., 36% from 44 8-bit ASCII characters being needed to represent sixteen [[byte]]s of binary data per frame).\n<!--{{clear}}-->\n\n===Data transfer for ROM and EPROM programming===\nIn the 1970s through the early 1980s, paper tape was commonly used to transfer binary data for incorporation in either mask-programmable [[Read-only memory|read-only memory (ROM)]] chips or their erasable counterparts \u2013 [[EPROM]]s. A significant variety of encoding formats were developed for use in computer and ROM/EPROM data transfer.<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dataio.com/main/Manuals/UniFam/Translation%20Formats.pdf |title=Translation File Formats |publisher=Data I/O Corporation |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref> Encoding formats commonly used were primarily driven by those formats that EPROM programming devices supported and included various ASCII hex variants as well as a number of proprietary formats.\n\nA much more primitive as well as a much longer high-level encoding scheme was also used \u2013 [[BNPF]] (Begin-Negative-Positive-Finish). In BNPF encoding, a single [[byte]] (8 bits) would be represented by a highly redundant character framing sequence starting with a single ASCII \"B\", eight ASCII characters where a \"0\" would be represented by a \"N\" and a \"1\" would be represented by a \"P\", followed by an ending ASCII \"F\". These ten-character ASCII sequences were separated by one or more [[whitespace character]]s, therefore using at least eleven ASCII characters for each byte stored (9% efficiency). The ASCII \"N\" and \"P\" characters differ in four bit positions, providing excellent protection from single punch errors. Alternative schemes were also available where \"L\" and \"H\" or \"0\" and \"1\" were also available to represent data bits, but in both of these encoding schemes, the two data-bearing ASCII characters differ in only one bit position, providing very poor single punch error detection.\n\n===Cash registers===\n[[NCR Corporation|NCR]] of [[Dayton, Ohio]], made cash registers around 1970 that would punch paper tape. [[Sweda]] made similar cash registers around the same time. The tape could then be read into a computer and not only could sales information be summarized, billings could be done on charge transactions. The tape was also used for inventory tracking, recording department and class numbers of items sold.\n\n===Newspaper industry===\nPunched paper tape was used by the newspaper industry until the mid-1970s or later. Newspapers were typically set in hot lead by devices like [[linotype machine]]s. With the wire services coming into a device that would punch paper tape, rather than the linotype operator having to retype all the incoming stories, the paper tape could be put into a paper tape reader on the linotype and it would create the lead slugs without the operator re-typing the stories. This also allowed newspapers to use devices, such as the [[Friden Flexowriter]], to convert typing to lead type via tape. Even after the demise of the Linotype/hot lead, many early \"offset\" devices had paper tape readers on them to produce the news-story copy.\n\nIf an error was found at one position on the six-level tape, that character could be turned into a null character to be skipped by punching out the remaining non-punched positions with what was known as a \u201cchicken plucker\". It looked like a strawberry stem remover that, pressed with thumb and forefinger, could punch out the remaining positions, one hole at a time.\n\n===Automated machinery===\n[[File:Paper tape reader on a CNC control 001.jpg|thumb|Paper tape reader on a [[Numerical control|computer numerical control]] (CNC) machine]]\n\nIn the 1970s, [[computer-aided manufacturing]] equipment often used paper tape. Paper tape was an important storage medium for computer-controlled [[wire-wrap]] machines, for example. A paper tape reader was smaller and less expensive than [[hollerith card]] or [[magnetic tape]] readers. Premium black waxed and lubricated long-fiber papers, and [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|Mylar film]] tape were invented so that production tapes for these machines would last longer.\n\n===Cryptography===\n[[Gilbert Vernam|Vernam ciphers]] were invented in 1917 to encrypt [[teleprinter]] communications using a key stored on paper tape. During the last third of the 20th century, the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) used punched paper tape to distribute [[key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]]. The eight-level paper tapes were distributed under strict accounting controls and read by a [[fill device]], such as the hand held [[KOI-18]], that was temporarily connected to each security device that needed new keys. NSA has been trying to replace this method with a more secure electronic key management system ([[EKMS]]), but as of 2016, paper tape is apparently still being employed.<ref name=taleoftape>[https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/misc/tale-of-the-tape.shtml Tale of the Tape], NSA/CSS, May 3, 2016, Accessed June 16, 2014</ref> The paper tape canister is a [[tamper-resistant]] container that contains features to prevent undetected alteration of the contents. \n[[File:Papertape2.jpg|thumb|Fanfold paper tape]]\n\n==Limitations==\nThe three biggest problems with paper tape were:\n{{quote|<poem>* Reliability. It was common practice to follow each mechanical copying of a tape with a manual hole-by-hole comparison.\n* Rewinding the tape was difficult and prone to problems. Great care was needed to avoid tearing the tape{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. Some systems used ''fanfold'' paper tape rather than rolled paper tape. In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy supply reel, takeup reel, or tension arm mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the takeup tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.\n* Low information density. Datasets much larger than a few dozen kilobytes are impractical to handle in paper tape format.</poem>}}\n\n==Advantages==\nPunched tape does have some useful properties:\n* Longevity. Although many [[magnetic tape]]s have deteriorated over time to the point that the data on them has been irretrievably lost, punched tape can be read many decades later, if [[acid-free paper]] or Mylar film is used. Some paper can degrade rapidly.\n* Human accessibility.  The hole patterns can be decoded visually if necessary, and torn tape can be repaired (using special all-hole pattern tape splices). Editing text on a punched tape was achieved by literally cutting and pasting the tape with scissors, glue, or by taping over a section to cover all holes and making new holes using a manual hole punch.\n* Magnetic field immunity. In a [[machine shop]] full of powerful electric motors, the [[numerical control]] programs need to survive the magnetic fields generated by those motors.<ref>\n{{cite book |first=N.K. |last=Sinha |title=Microprocessor-Based Control Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgalRre0L8wC&pg=PA264 |date=30 June 1986 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-277-2287-4 |pages=264 |quote=\"Paper tape is well suited to a machine shop environment whereas magnetic tape may be accidentally erased or contaminated by foreign substances. ...&nbsp;Other disadvantages of paper tape are as follows&nbsp;...\"}}</ref><!--<ref>[http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=72469 \"computer programming punch paper tape\"]: \"Factory computer numerical control (CNC) equipment used paper tape well into the 1980s\"</ref>-->\n* Ease of destruction.  In the case of cryptographic keys, the inherent flammability (sometimes enhanced by using flash paper) of paper tape was an asset.  Once the key had been loaded into the device, the paper tape could simply be burned, preventing the key from falling into enemy hands.\n\n==Punched tape in art==\n\nA computing or telecommunications professional depicted in the [[Monument to the Conquerors of Space]] in Moscow (1964) holds what appears to be a punched tape with three rows of rectangular holes.\n\n==Current use==\nNowadays punched tape use is very rare. It may still be used in older military systems{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} and by some hobbyists. In [[Numerical control|computer numerical control]] (CNC) machining applications, very few people still use tape. However, some modern CNC systems still measure the size of stored CNC programs in feet or meters, corresponding to the equivalent length if punched on paper tape.<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Smid |title= CNC Control Setup for Milling and Turning: Mastering CNC Control Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2ev3yYwvq0C&pg=PA20 |year=2010 |publisher=Industrial Press |isbn= 978-0-8311-3350-4 |pages=20}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bit bucket]]\n* [[Book music]]\n* [[Key punch]]\n* [[Music roll]]\n* [[Tape library]]\n* [[Zygalski sheets]] \u2013 a system used to decrypt messages enciphered on German [[Enigma machine]]s\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Punched tapes}}\n* {{cite web |first= |last= |title=ECMA standard for Data Interchange on Punched Tape |date=November 1965 |id=ECMA-10 |publisher=European Computer Manufacturers Association |url=http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~jsm28/ECMA-10/}}\n* [http://www.poppyfields.net/filks/00124.html A song mentioning paper tape]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040408201444/http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/punched.html Various punched media]\n* [http://blinkenlights.com/classiccmp/friden/ Friden Flexowriter] combination typewriter, [[paper tape]] punch, and paper tape reader, designed by IBM during the 1940s and bought out by [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] in the late 1950s (Retrieved April 10, 2007)\n* [http://www.technikum29.de/de/geraete/olympia-schreibautomat.shtm Olympia Flexowriter]\n* [http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/39/394.html Detailed description of two paper tape code systems], [[Baudot code]] and the system used by the [[ILLIAC]] computer\n*Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U9-gFkPVwM Working paper tape punch/reader GNT 3601], [[Mus\u00e9e Bolo]], YouTube\n\n\n\n{{Paper data storage media}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Punched Tape}}\n[[Category:Computer storage tape media]]\n[[Category:History of computing]]\n[[Category:Telegraphy]]\n", "name_user": "Netjeff", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLimitations:Formatting: un-indented the list", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_tape"}
