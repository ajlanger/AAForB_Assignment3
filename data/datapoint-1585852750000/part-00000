As '''Charles V''', he was the first of the [[Carlism|Carlist]] claimants to the throne of [[Spain]]. He is often referred to simply as 'Don Carlos'. He was a reactionary who stridently opposed liberalism in Spain and the assaults on the [[Catholic Church]]. He claimed the throne of Spain after the death of his older brother King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] in 1833. His claim was contested by liberal forces loyal to the dead king's infant daughter. The result was the bloody [[First Carlist War]] (1833\u20131840). Don Carlos had support from Basque provinces and much of Catalonia, but lost the war and never became king. His heirs continued the arch-conservative cause, fought two more Carlist wars and were active into the mid-20th century, but never obtained the throne.\n\n== Early life ==\nCarlos was born on 29 March 1788 at the [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez]] in [[Aranjuez]], [[Community of Madrid]]. In 1808, [[Napoleon]] captured Madrid in the [[Battle of Somosierra]], and he induced Carlos's father Charles IV and Carlos' older brother Ferdinand VII to renounce their rights to the throne of Spain. But Carlos, who was heir presumptive to his brother, refused to renounce his rights to the throne, which he considered to have been given to him by God. From 1808 until 1814, he and his brothers were prisoners of Napoleon at the palace of [[Valen\u00e7ay]] in France.\n\nIn 1814, Carlos and the rest of the Spanish royal family returned to [[Madrid]]. In September 1816, he married his niece [[Infanta Maria Francisca of Portugal]] (1800\u20131834), daughter of King [[John VI of Portugal]] and Carlos' sister [[Carlota Joaquina of Spain|Carlota Joaquina]]. Francisca was also sister of the second wife of Carlos' brother, Ferdinand VII. The couple had three sons:\n\n* [[Infante Carlos, Count of Montemolin|Infante Carlos de Borb\u00f3n y Braganza]] (1818\u20131861), known as Count of Montemolin\n* [[Juan, Count of Montiz\u00f3n|Infante Juan de Borb\u00f3n y Braganza]] (1822\u20131887), known as Count of Montiz\u00f3n\n* [[Infante Fernando of Bourbon and Braganza|Infante Fernando de Borb\u00f3n y Braganza]] (1824\u20131861)\n\nApart from several formal offices, Carlos took no significant part in the government of Spain. Ferdinand VII had found it necessary to cooperate with the moderate liberals and to sign a [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution]]. Carlos, however, was known for his firm belief in the [[divine right of kings]] to govern absolutely, the rigid orthodoxy of his religious opinions, and the piety of his life.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Carlos, Don (Count of Molina)|display=Carlos, Don}}</ref>\n\nDuring the revolutionary troubles of 1820\u20131823 (the \"liberal triennium\"), Carlos was threatened by the extreme radicals, but no attack was made on him.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> While there were certain conservatives in Spain who wanted to put Carlos on the throne immediately, Carlos himself was a firm believer in the legitimate succession and would never have taken up arms against his brother.\n\n==Pragmatic Sanction of 1830==\nIn May 1830, Ferdinand VII published the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830|Pragmatic Sanction]], again allowing daughters to succeed to the Spanish throne as well as sons. This decree had originally been approved by the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in 1789, but it had never been officially promulgated. On 10 October 1830, Ferdinand's wife gave birth to a daughter [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella]], who thereupon displaced her uncle in the line of succession.\n\nThe clerical party (called in Spanish 'apost\u00f3licos') continued to support the rights of Carlos to the throne. They considered the Pragmatic Sanction not only impractical but also illegal. They intrigued in favour of Carlos, but he himself would do no more than assert his rights in words. His wife and her sister, [[Teresa, Princess of Beira|Maria Teresa]] (1793\u20131874), the princess of [[Prince of Beira|Beira]], on the other hand, were actively engaged in intrigues with the apost\u00f3licos.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn March 1833, Ferdinand 'authorised' Carlos to go to [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] with his wife and sister-in-law. The 'authorisation' was in fact an order to remove Carlos and his adherents from Spain.\n\nIn April 1833, Ferdinand called upon Carlos to take an oath of allegiance to Isabella as [[Prince of Asturias|Princess of Asturias]], the title traditionally used by the first in line to the throne. In respectful but firm terms, Carlos refused. He had no personal desire for the throne, but he was adamant that he could not renounce what he considered to be his God-given rights and responsibilities.\n\n==Succession==\n\nFerdinand VII died on 29 September 1833. In Madrid, his widow declared herself regent for their daughter. On 1 October, Carlos issued a manifesto declaring his own accession to the throne. He informed the members of Maria Cristina's government that they were confirmed in their posts, and proceeded to the Portuguese-Spanish border. There, he was met by forces loyal to Maria Cristina and Isabella, who threatened to arrest him. Carlos remained in Portugal, which itself was in a state of [[Liberal Wars|civil war]] between the adherents of Carlos' nephew and brother-in-law [[Miguel of Portugal|Miguel]] and his grand-niece, Miguel's niece [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]. In Spain, there were various risings which developed into the [[First Carlist War]].\n\nWhen the Miguelist party was finally beaten in Portugal in 1834, Carlos escaped to [[England]], where the government offered to grant him an annual pension of 30,000 pounds if he would renounce his claims and never return to Spain or Portugal. Carlos refused absolutely. In July, he passed over to France, where he was actively aided by the [[legitimist]] party. He soon joined his adherents at Elizondo in the western [[Pyrenees]] of Spain. In October 1834, his sister-in-law Cristina issued a decree depriving him of his rights as an [[Infante]] of Spain; this was confirmed by the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in 1837.\n\nCarlos remained in Spain for five years. During these years, he accompanied his armies, without displaying any of the qualities of a general or even much personal courage. But he endured a good deal of hardship, and was often compelled to take to hiding in the hills. On these occasions, he was often carried over difficult places on the back of a stout guide commonly known as the \"royal jackass\" (''burro real'').<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe semblance of a court which Carlos maintained was torn by incessant personal intrigues.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> While some of his adherents supported him because they believed in his hereditary rights to the throne, others were more concerned to preserve home rule in the [[History of the Basque people#Modern Period|Basque districts]]. There were ongoing conflicts between Carlos' military staff and the clergy who exercised significant influence over him.\n\nIn the first few years of the war, there were several moments when victory was within Carlos' grasp. The last of these was the so-called Royal Expedition of the summer of 1837, when Carlos himself accompanied his army from Navarre to the outskirts of Madrid. Carlos hoped to enter the city without any significant bloodshed, but when it became clear that only a battle would win the city, Carlos vacillated. After several days, Carlos himself decided to withdraw; his army melted away and was reduced to a third of its former strength.\n\nHis first wife having died in England in 1834, Carlos married her elder sister, his own niece [[Teresa, Princess of Beira|Maria Teresa of Portugal]], Princess of Beira in [[Biscay]] in October 1837.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn June 1838, Carlos appointed [[Rafael Maroto]] as his commander-in-chief. In February 1839, Maroto had four Carlist generals shot and issued a proclamation criticizing Carlos' court. When Carlos removed him from office, Maroto marched to Tolosa where Carlos was living and made him a virtual prisoner. Maroto was re-appointed commander-in-chief, and his opponents in Carlos' court were dismissed. Maroto then began private negotiations with Cristina's commander-in-chief, and in August 1839 abandoned Carlos completely.\n[[File:Carlos Maria Isidro de Borbon (Carlos V).jpg|thumb|160px|Don Carlos, 1853]]\n\n==Final exile==\n\nIn September 1839, Carlos left Spain for France, where he was briefly imprisoned. For almost another year, some of his commanders continued to fight on his behalf, especially in [[Catalonia]]. However, by July 1840, almost all resistance was concluded.\n\nIn May 1845, Carlos renounced his rights to the throne of Spain in favour of his eldest son, Carlos Luis. Subsequently, he used the title 'count of Molina'. On 10 March 1855, he died at [[Trieste]] (then in the [[Austrian Empire]]), where he is buried in the chapel of Saint Charles Borromeo in the [[Trieste Cathedral|cathedral of San Giusto]].\n\nIn midst of the first Carlist War, on 15 January 1837, the Cortes passed a law, ratified by royal decree of Regent Mar\u00eda Cristina, which excluded Don Carlos and several of his named allies from the succession to the Spanish crown and declared them stripped of their Spanish titles. These were: Carlos himself, his descendants, his ally and future wife Teresa of Portugal, Teresa's son Sebastian (1811\u20131875), and Carlos's nephew [[Miguel I of Portugal]] (1802\u20131866), the other absolutist rival monarch in another country. They were so deprived as \"rebels\".\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|title=Genealogie ascendante jusqu'au quatrieme degre inclusivement de tous les Rois et Princes de maisons souveraines de l'Europe actuellement vivans| trans-title=Genealogy up to the fourth degree inclusive of all the Kings and Princes of sovereign houses of Europe currently living |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AINPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA9|year=1768|publisher=Frederic Guillaume Birnstiel|location=Bourdeaux|language=fr|pages=9<!--father's side-->, 96<!--mother's side-->}}</ref>\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
