One of these statues is thought to have been a [[Black Madonna]], venerated as [[Our Lady of Willesden]], which was insulted by the [[Lollards]], taken to Thomas Cromwell's house and burnt in 1538 on a large bonfire of \"notable images\" including those of [[Our Lady of Walsingham]], Our Lady of Worcester, and [[Our Lady of Ipswich]].

By 1906 the population had grown to 140,000, a phenomenon of rapid growth that was to be repeated in the 1920s in neighbouring areas such as [[Harrow, London|Harrow]]. The Metropolitan line service was withdrawn in 1940, when the station was served by the Bakerloo line,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} and later the [[Jubilee line]].\n\nThe [[First World War]] caused Willesden to change from a predominantly [[middle class]] suburb to a [[working class]] part of London. After the war, Willesden grew rapidly as many factories opened up with numerous flats and terraced houses. The local council encouraged building to prevent large unemployment and decline.\nTo the present day, Willesden has been shaped by the patterns of migration which marks it out as one of the most diverse areas in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[City of London Corporation]] records show that the first black person recorded in Brent was Sarah Eco, who was christened in St. Mary\u2019s Church in Willesden on 15 September 1723.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brent.gov.uk/Heritage.nsf/24878f4b00d4f0f68025663c006c7944/0ff7e91c2dfaf43380256b21002eb018/$FILE/ChurchEnd.PDF |title=Church End and the Parish of Willesden |publisher=[[Brent London Borough Council|Brent Council]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423140355/http://www.brent.gov.uk/Heritage.nsf/24878f4b00d4f0f68025663c006c7944/0ff7e91c2dfaf43380256b21002eb018/%24FILE/ChurchEnd.PDF |archivedate=23 April 2007 |accessdate=22 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[United Kingdom Census 1901|1901 United Kingdom census]] recorded that 42% of the population was born in London. In 1923, the specialist coach builder [[Freestone and Webb]] established their base in Willesden, producing bespoke cars on [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and Bentley chassis until 1956.\n\nWillesden became a municipal borough in 1933, and it is at this time that the area became predominantly working class. A small [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] community had formed in Willesden by this time, which grew rapidly during the period of the [[Second World War]]. A small Jewish community of refugees from Europe also formed during the war, with 3.5% of the population in 1951 born in [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or [[Austria]].\nDuring the war, Willesden suffered large bombing damage due to the heavy concentration of manufacturing industry, such as munition factories, the location of 'Smiths Instruments\" (Used defensive aircraft instrumentation). Mulliner-Park Ward (Coach builders to Rolls Royce and Bentley, hand built cars).

The whole of central Willesden (bar the area by the Willesden Green station) was earmarked for redevelopment; however, this did not come to fruition. In the late 1980s, traders were given money to revamp the High Street to prevent shops closing.\n\nThe area surrounding [[Willesden Green tube station|Willesden Green station]] has become more middle-class and gentrified with marked property price rises in 2014 and 2015.<ref name=\"brignall1\"/><ref name=\"mcghie1\"/>\n\n[[File:Willesden French Market 2006.jpg|thumb|Willesden French Market]]\n\n==Politics==\nThe Willesden Green ward is represented on [[Brent Council]] by three [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[councillor]]s,  Fleur Donnelly-Jackson, Elliot George Chappell and Tom Miller.\n\nWillesden forms part of the [[Brent Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent Central]] parliamentary constituency and is home to the local [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP [[Dawn Butler]].\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the 2011 census, the Willesden Green ward had a population of 15,587.

By 1906 the population had grown to 140,000, a phenomenon of rapid growth that was to be repeated in the 1920s in neighbouring areas such as [[Harrow, London|Harrow]]. The Metropolitan line service was withdrawn in 1940, when the station was served by the Bakerloo line,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} and later the [[Jubilee line]].\n\nThe [[First World War]] caused Willesden to change from a predominantly [[middle class]] suburb to a [[working class]] part of London. After the war, Willesden grew rapidly as many factories opened up with numerous flats and terraced houses. The local council encouraged building to prevent large unemployment and decline.\nTo the present day, Willesden has been shaped by the patterns of migration which marks it out as one of the most diverse areas in the [[United Kingdom]].

A small [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] community had formed in Willesden by this time, which grew rapidly during the period of the [[Second World War]]. A small Jewish community of refugees from Europe also formed during the war, with 3.5% of the population in 1951 born in [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or [[Austria]].\nDuring the war, Willesden suffered large bombing damage due to the heavy concentration of manufacturing industry, such as munition factories, the location of 'Smiths Instruments\" (Used defensive aircraft instrumentation).

''The Observer''. 10 November 2002.</ref> Since the 1960s, Willesden has been popular with young working holidaymakers from [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], although this popularity has declined somewhat in favour of other areas since about 2003.\n\nWillesden went into a period of decline during the 1970s and 1980s as much of the housing was inadequate due to overcrowding as industry was mixed with housing. The whole of central Willesden (bar the area by the Willesden Green station) was earmarked for redevelopment; however, this did not come to fruition. In the late 1980s, traders were given money to revamp the High Street to prevent shops closing.\n\nThe area surrounding [[Willesden Green tube station|Willesden Green station]] has become more middle-class and gentrified with marked property price rises in 2014 and 2015.<ref name=\"brignall1\"/><ref name=\"mcghie1\"/>\n\n[[File:Willesden French Market 2006.jpg|thumb|Willesden French Market]]\n\n==Politics==\nThe Willesden Green ward is represented on [[Brent Council]] by three [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[councillor]]s,  Fleur Donnelly-Jackson, Elliot George Chappell and Tom Miller.\n\nWillesden forms part of the [[Brent Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent Central]] parliamentary constituency and is home to the local [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP [[Dawn Butler]].\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the 2011 census, the Willesden Green ward had a population of 15,587.
