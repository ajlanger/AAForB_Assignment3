Despite the Spirit's origin as detective/criminoligist Denny Colt, his real identity was rarely referred to after his first appearance, and for all intents and purposes he was simply \"The Spirit\". The stories are presented in a wide variety of styles, from straightforward [[crime drama]] and [[Hardboiled|noir]] to lighthearted adventure, from [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] to [[comedy]] and [[Romance comics in the United States (1946\u20131975)|love stories]], often with hybrid elements that twisted genre and reader expectations.\n\nFrom the 1960s to 1980s, a handful of new Eisner Spirit stories appeared in [[Harvey Comics]] and elsewhere, and [[Warren Publishing]] and [[Kitchen Sink Press]] variously reprinted the newspaper feature in black-and-white comics magazines and in color comic books. In the 1990s and 2000s, Kitchen Sink Press and [[DC Comics]] also published new Spirit stories by other writers and artists.\n\nIn 2011, [[IGN]] ranked the Spirit 21st in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of all time.\n\n==Publication history==\nIn late 1939, [[Everett M. \"Busy\" Arnold]], [[publisher]] of the [[Quality Comics]] comic-book line, began exploring an expansion into newspaper Sunday supplements, aware that many newspapers felt they had to compete with the suddenly burgeoning new medium of [[American comic books]], as exemplified by the ''Chicago Tribune Comic Book'', premiering two months before \"The Spirit Section\".<ref>{{cite web | authorlink = Allan Holtz | first = Allan | last = Holtz | url = http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/search/label/Chicago%20Tribune%20Comic%20Book | date = May 9, 2013 | title = The Chicago Tribune Comic Book: Introduction | publisher = The Stripper's Guide | accessdate = May 10, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082757/http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/search/label/Chicago%20Tribune%20Comic%20Book | archivedate = January 2, 2016 | url-status=live | df = }}</ref> Arnold compiled a presentation piece with existing Quality Comics material. An editor of ''[[The Washington Star]]'' liked [[George Brenner]]'s comic-book feature \"[[Clock (comics)|The Clock]]\", but not Brenner's art, and was favorably disposed toward a [[Lou Fine]] strip. Arnold, concerned over the meticulous Fine's slowness and his ability to meet deadlines, claimed it was the work of Eisner, Fine's boss at the [[Eisner & Iger]] studio, from which Arnold bought his outsourced comics work.\n\nIn \"late '39, just before [[Christmas]] time\", Eisner recalled in 1979,<ref>''Panels'' #1 (Summer 1979), \"Art & Commerce: An Oral Reminiscence by Will Eisner\", pp. 5\u201321, quoted in {{cite web|last=Quattro|first=Ken|url=http://www.comicartville.com/rareeisner.htm|title=Rare Eisner: Making of a Genius|publisher=Comicartville Library|year=2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030074220/http://www.comicartville.com/rareeisner.htm|archivedate=October 30, 2009|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> \"Arnold came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom\".

Martin asked if I could do it... It meant that I'd have to leave Eisner & Iger [which] was making money; we were very profitable at that time and things were going very well. A hard decision.

After this (and apart from one final mention of his name in the text-based splash page of \"The Inner Voice\", published November 6, 1949), Ebony left the strip without fanfare or explanation, and Sammy functioned as the Spirit's assistant for the strip's final three years.<ref>Eisner, Will (2006).

Eisner also eventually used ghostwriters, generally in collaboration with him.\n\n[[Jules Feiffer]], who began as an art assistant circa 1946 and later became the primary writer through the strip's end in 1952, recalled, \"When I first worked for Will there was [[John Spranger (comics)|John Spranger]], who was his penciler and a wonderful draftsman; better than Will. There was [[Sam Rosen (comics)|Sam Rosen]], the lettering man. [[Jerry Grandenetti]] came a little after me and did backgrounds, and Jerry had some architectural background. His drawing was stiff but loosened up after a while, but he drew backgrounds and inked them beautifully. And [[Abe Kanegson]], who was my best friend in the office, was a jack-of-all-trades but mostly did lettering and backgrounds after Jerry left. Abe was a mentor to me.\"<ref>Transcript of March 24, 2010, Feiffer interview at the [[Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art]], published as {{cite web | url = http://filmfestivaltraveler.com/film-arts/50-previews/674-backing-into-jules-feiffer-an-exclusive-qaa | title = Backing into Jules Feiffer: An Exclusive Q&A | page = [http://filmfestivaltraveler.com/film-arts/50-previews/674-backing-into-jules-feiffer-an-exclusive-qaa?showall=&start=1 2] | publisher = FilmFestivalTraveler.com | date = 18 April 2010 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120320053129/http://filmfestivaltraveler.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=705:jules-feiffer-qa&catid=31:general | archivedate = March 20, 2012 | url-status=live | df = }}</ref>\n\nEisner's studio also included:<ref name=gcd1940series>[http://www.comics.org/series/10295/ ''Spirit, The'' (Register and Tribune Syndicate, 1940 Series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Leiffer | first = Paul | first2 = Hames, eds. | last2 = Ware | url = http://www.bpib.com/comicsproj/creditsSZ.html | title = Comic Strip Credits S-Z | publisher = The Comic Strip Project | year = 1999 | archivedate = February 24, 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120224150716/http://www.bpib.com/comicsproj/creditsSZ.html | df = }} Main page [https://web.archive.org/web/20100323073609/http://www.bpib.com/comicsproj/ archived] from the original on July 4, 2012.</ref><ref>{{cite web | authorlink = Cat Yronwode | last = Yronwode | first = Cat | first2 = Wes, eds. | last2 = Tumulka | url = http://www.wildwoodcemetery.com/checklist.shtml | title = The Spirit Checklist | publisher = WildwoodCemetery.com | archivedate = February 7, 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110207201042/http://www.wildwoodcemetery.com/ | url-status=live | df = }}</ref>\n\n*Art assistants: [[Bob Powell (comics)|Bob Powell]] (1940), [[Dave Berg (cartoonist)|Dave Berg]] (backgrounds, 1940\u201341), Tex Blaisdell (1940\u201341), [[Fred Kida]] (1941), Alexander Kostuk a.k.a.

Eisner, the overall editor, wrote and drew most Spirit entries, with the uncredited assistance of his studio of assistants and collaborators, though with Eisner's singular vision a unifying factor.<ref>\"Will Eisner Interview,\" ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #46 (May 1979), pp. 35-49. Interview conducted by [[Catherine Yronwode]] October 13th and 17th, 1978</ref>\n\n''The Spirit'' chronicles the adventures of a masked [[vigilante]] who fights crime with the blessing of the city's police commissioner Dolan, an old friend. Despite the Spirit's origin as detective/criminoligist Denny Colt, his real identity was rarely referred to after his first appearance, and for all intents and purposes he was simply \"The Spirit\". The stories are presented in a wide variety of styles, from straightforward [[crime drama]] and [[Hardboiled|noir]] to lighthearted adventure, from [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] to [[comedy]] and [[Romance comics in the United States (1946\u20131975)|love stories]], often with hybrid elements that twisted genre and reader expectations.\n\nFrom the 1960s to 1980s, a handful of new Eisner Spirit stories appeared in [[Harvey Comics]] and elsewhere, and [[Warren Publishing]] and [[Kitchen Sink Press]] variously reprinted the newspaper feature in black-and-white comics magazines and in color comic books. In the 1990s and 2000s, Kitchen Sink Press and [[DC Comics]] also published new Spirit stories by other writers and artists.\n\nIn 2011, [[IGN]] ranked the Spirit 21st in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of all time.\n\n==Publication history==\nIn late 1939, [[Everett M. \"Busy\" Arnold]], [[publisher]] of the [[Quality Comics]] comic-book line, began exploring an expansion into newspaper Sunday supplements, aware that many newspapers felt they had to compete with the suddenly burgeoning new medium of [[American comic books]], as exemplified by the ''Chicago Tribune Comic Book'', premiering two months before \"The Spirit Section\".<ref>{{cite web | authorlink = Allan Holtz | first = Allan | last = Holtz | url = http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/search/label/Chicago%20Tribune%20Comic%20Book | date = May 9, 2013 | title = The Chicago Tribune Comic Book: Introduction | publisher = The Stripper's Guide | accessdate = May 10, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082757/http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/search/label/Chicago%20Tribune%20Comic%20Book | archivedate = January 2, 2016 | url-status=live | df = }}</ref> Arnold compiled a presentation piece with existing Quality Comics material. An editor of ''[[The Washington Star]]'' liked [[George Brenner]]'s comic-book feature \"[[Clock (comics)|The Clock]]\", but not Brenner's art, and was favorably disposed toward a [[Lou Fine]] strip. Arnold, concerned over the meticulous Fine's slowness and his ability to meet deadlines, claimed it was the work of Eisner, Fine's boss at the [[Eisner & Iger]] studio, from which Arnold bought his outsourced comics work.\n\nIn \"late '39, just before [[Christmas]] time\", Eisner recalled in 1979,<ref>''Panels'' #1 (Summer 1979), \"Art & Commerce: An Oral Reminiscence by Will Eisner\", pp. 5\u201321, quoted in {{cite web|last=Quattro|first=Ken|url=http://www.comicartville.com/rareeisner.htm|title=Rare Eisner: Making of a Genius|publisher=Comicartville Library|year=2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030074220/http://www.comicartville.com/rareeisner.htm|archivedate=October 30, 2009|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> \"Arnold came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom\".

Martin asked if I could do it... It meant that I'd have to leave Eisner & Iger [which] was making money; we were very profitable at that time and things were going very well. A hard decision. Anyway, I agreed to do the Sunday comic book and we started discussing the deal [which] was that we'd be partners in the \"Comic Book Section\", as they called it at that time.<ref name=ae48p10>Will Eisner interview, ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' #48, May 2005, p. 10</ref>}}\n\nEisner negotiated an agreement with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright the feature but, \"Written down in the contract I had with 'Busy' Arnold{{nbsp}}\u2014 and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership{{nbsp}}\u2014 Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened.

He said, 'How about a thing called the Ghost?' and I said, 'Naw, that's not any good,' and he said, 'Well, then, call it the Spirit; there's nothing like that around.' I said, 'Well, I don't know what you mean.,' and he said, 'Well, you can figure ''that'' out\u2014I just like the words \"the Spirit.\"' He was calling from a bar somewhere, I think...

He became a mainstay of the strip and a principal member of the Spirit's supporting cast until Eisner phased him out of the narrative in mid-1949 and replaced him with another assistant, a Caucasian boy named Sammy.

Shortly afterward, the Robbins Music Corporation of New York published \"Ev'ry Little Bug\" as sheet music, with an image of Ebony on its cover page.{{cn|date=February 2020}} After three more appearances in the strip, \"Ev'ry Little Bug\" remained dormant until 1987, when music producer John Christensen assembled a recording featuring five versions of the tune, released by Kitchen Sink as a picture disc with an exclusive Spirit/Ebony image illustrated by Eisner. The record featured actor [[Billy Mumy]] playing guitar on some tracks.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Song appearances===\n*June 9, 1946 - \"Poole's Toadstool Facial Cream\"\n*July 7, 1946 - \"Dulcet Tone\"\n*October 13, 1946 - \"The Heart of Rosie Lee\"\n*December 15, 1946 - \"The Van Gaul Diamonds\"\n*December 29, 1946 - \"Hubert The Duck\"\n*February 2, 1947 - \"The Cosmic Answer\"\n*March 16, 1947 - \"Hoagy the Yogi\"\n*April 27, 1947 - \"Ev'ry Li'l Bug\"\n*June 29, 1947 - \"Wiffenpoof\"\n*August 17, 1947 - \"The Picnic\"\n*March 27, 1949 - \"The Dummy\"\n*April 30, 1950 - \"Wanted, Dangerous Job\"\n\n==The Spirit and John Law==\nSeveral Spirit stories, such as the first appearance of Sand Saref, were retooled from a failed publishing venture featuring an [[eyepatch]]ed, [[pipe-smoking]] detective named [[John Law (comics)|John Law]]. Law and his shoeshine-boy sidekick, Nubbin, starred in several adventures planned for a new comics series. These completed adventures were eventually adapted into Spirit stories, with John Law's eyepatch being changed to the Spirit's mask, and Nubbin redrawn as Willum Waif or other Spirit supporting characters.\n\nThe original John Law stories were restored and published in ''Will Eisner's John Law: Dead Man Walking'' ([[IDW Publishing]], 2004), a collection of stories that also features new adventures by writer-artist Gary Chaloner, starring John Law, Nubbin, and other Eisner creations, including ''[[Lady Luck (comics)|Lady Luck]]'' and ''[[Mr. Mystic]]''.\n\n==Assistants and collaborators==\nLike most artists working in newspaper comic strips, Eisner after a time employed a studio of assistants who, on any given week's story, might draw or simply ink backgrounds, ink parts of Eisner's main characters (such as clothing or shoes), or as eventually occurred, ghost-draw the strip entirely. Eisner also eventually used ghostwriters, generally in collaboration with him.\n\n[[Jules Feiffer]], who began as an art assistant circa 1946 and later became the primary writer through the strip's end in 1952, recalled, \"When I first worked for Will there was [[John Spranger (comics)|John Spranger]], who was his penciler and a wonderful draftsman; better than Will. There was [[Sam Rosen (comics)|Sam Rosen]], the lettering man. [[Jerry Grandenetti]] came a little after me and did backgrounds, and Jerry had some architectural background. His drawing was stiff but loosened up after a while, but he drew backgrounds and inked them beautifully. And [[Abe Kanegson]], who was my best friend in the office, was a jack-of-all-trades but mostly did lettering and backgrounds after Jerry left. Abe was a mentor to me.\"<ref>Transcript of March 24, 2010, Feiffer interview at the [[Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art]], published as {{cite web | url = http://filmfestivaltraveler.com/film-arts/50-previews/674-backing-into-jules-feiffer-an-exclusive-qaa | title = Backing into Jules Feiffer: An Exclusive Q&A | page = [http://filmfestivaltraveler.com/film-arts/50-previews/674-backing-into-jules-feiffer-an-exclusive-qaa?showall=&start=1 2] | publisher = FilmFestivalTraveler.com | date = 18 April 2010 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120320053129/http://filmfestivaltraveler.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=705:jules-feiffer-qa&catid=31:general | archivedate = March 20, 2012 | url-status=live | df = }}</ref>\n\nEisner's studio also included:<ref name=gcd1940series>[http://www.comics.org/series/10295/ ''Spirit, The'' (Register and Tribune Syndicate, 1940 Series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Leiffer | first = Paul | first2 = Hames, eds. | last2 = Ware | url = http://www.bpib.com/comicsproj/creditsSZ.html | title = Comic Strip Credits S-Z | publisher = The Comic Strip Project | year = 1999 | archivedate = February 24, 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120224150716/http://www.bpib.com/comicsproj/creditsSZ.html | df = }} Main page [https://web.archive.org/web/20100323073609/http://www.bpib.com/comicsproj/ archived] from the original on July 4, 2012.</ref><ref>{{cite web | authorlink = Cat Yronwode | last = Yronwode | first = Cat | first2 = Wes, eds. | last2 = Tumulka | url = http://www.wildwoodcemetery.com/checklist.shtml | title = The Spirit Checklist | publisher = WildwoodCemetery.com | archivedate = February 7, 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110207201042/http://www.wildwoodcemetery.com/ | url-status=live | df = }}</ref>\n\n*Art assistants: [[Bob Powell (comics)|Bob Powell]] (1940), [[Dave Berg (cartoonist)|Dave Berg]] (backgrounds, 1940\u201341), Tex Blaisdell (1940\u201341), [[Fred Kida]] (1941), Alexander Kostuk a.k.a.
