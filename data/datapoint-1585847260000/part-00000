{"title_page": "The Ward, Toronto", "text_new": "[[File:Elizabeth St, at Dundas, looking south.jpg|thumb|Looking south from the centre of St. John's Ward at Albert Street (Dundas Street) and Elizabeth Street. c. 1930]]\n'''The Ward''' (formally '''St. John's Ward''') was a [[neighbourhood]] in central [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The neighbourhood was a location where many new immigrants first settled.\n\nIt was bounded by [[College Street (Toronto)|College]], [[Queen Street West|Queen]], and [[Yonge Street]]s and [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]] and was centred on the intersection of Terauley (now [[Bay Street|Bay]]) and Albert Streets.\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Butcher sign in the Ward.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] butcher shop sign in the Ward, circa 1910]]\nFor several decades of the late 19th and early 20th century, it was a highly dense [[Mixed-use development|mixed-used]] neighbourhood where successive waves of new immigrants would initially settle before establishing themselves. Characterized by authorities in the 19th century as a [[slum]], it was the home of refugees from the European [[Revolutions of 1848]], the [[Irish Potato Famine]], the [[Underground Railroad]], and then refugees from Russia and Eastern Europe. It was the centre of the city's [[Jew]]ish community from the late 19th century until the 1920s when the Jewish community moved west to [[Spadina Avenue]] and [[Kensington Market]] and was also, until the late 1950s, the home of the city's original [[Chinatown, Toronto#First Chinatown|Chinatown]], of many of the city's original [[Black Canadians|Black]] residents centred on the [[British Methodist Episcopal Church]], at 94 Chestnut Street, and of the city's Italian community until it moved west along College Street to [[Little Italy, Toronto|Little Italy]]. The city's Polish, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, and numerous other non-Anglo-Saxon immigrants first established themselves in The Ward.\n\nToday, the area is considered a part of what the City of Toronto now calls the [[Discovery District]], the area having been consumed by the [[central business district]]. The old neighbourhood has not wholly disappeared. The short restaurant strip on the south side of Dundas Street between University Avenue and Bay Street still retains many buildings which were part of the Ward. The building in the right of the lead photograph in this article is still standing at Dundas and Elizabeth (it is now home to a Japanese restaurant). The YWCA at 87 Elm Street was originally the [[Toronto House of Industry]], a workhouse established in the centre of the Ward in 1848 to serve impoverished residents. Also, a small group of row houses still stands on Elm Street just west of Bay Street, on the south side - possibly the last surviving remnant of the ward's residential character.

In the 1890s, an influx of Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe began arriving in Toronto. For the several thousand new arrivals, mostly impoverished and unable to speak English, the densely packed houses of The Ward became their new community.\n\nThe Ward was also home to [[First Chinatown, Toronto|Toronto's first Chinatown]] as Chinese railway workers settled along York and Elizabeth Streets north of [[Toronto Union Station (1873)|Union Station]].\n\n===1900s===\n[[File:The Ward as viewed from Eaton factory.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Ward, 1910]]\nThe development of the neighbourhood caused much consternation in Toronto, including anti-Semitic riots and government clearance efforts.
