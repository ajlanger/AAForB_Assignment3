The record was released on December 13, 2013, by [[Parkwood Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]]. Developed as a \"visual album\", its songs are accompanied by non-linear short films that illustrate the musical concepts conceived during production. Its dark, intimate subject material includes [[feminist]] themes of [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[Monogamy|monogamous love]], and relationship issues, inspired by Beyonc\u00e9's desire to assert her full creative freedom. ''Beyonc\u00e9'' is credited for changing the general release date for music from Monday to Friday.\n\nThe album's initial recording began in [[New York City]], where Beyonc\u00e9 invited producers and songwriters to live with her for a month. During extensive touring the following year, the album changed as she conceived of creating a visual accompaniment to its songs and resumed recording sessions with [[Electronic music|electronic]] producer and [[Rock music|rock]] musician [[Boots (musician)|Boots]]. Their collaboration led to more sonically [[Experimental music|experimental]] material, which combined [[contemporary R&B]] with electronic and [[soul music]]. Throughout this period, the album's songs and videos were composed in strict secrecy as Beyonc\u00e9 devised an unexpected release.\n\n''Beyonc\u00e9'' was released digitally on the [[iTunes Store]] without prior announcement or promotion, and debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], earning Beyonc\u00e9 her fifth consecutive number-one album on the chart. The album sold over 617,000 copies in the United States and 828,773 copies worldwide in its first three days of sales, becoming the fastest-selling album in the history of the iTunes Store up to that point.<ref>{{cite news|first=Clarisse|last=Loughrey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/adeles-album-is-no1-in-almost-every-country-in-the-world-a6749626.html|title=Adele's new album 25 is No.1 on iTunes in almost every country in the world|date=November 26, 2015|work=Independent|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref> According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Beyonc\u00e9'' was globally the tenth-best-selling album of 2013.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|title=Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 26, 2014|page=12}}</ref> It received universal acclaim from critics, who praised its production, exploration of sexuality, and vocal performance.

In an interview for ''Pitchfork'' after the album's release, Boots was coy when answering questions about how Beyonc\u00e9 discovered his demo or of his work previous to the project, only confirming his signing. In June 2013, they met in person for the first time and Boots presented Beyonc\u00e9 with material he felt would resonate with her. However, Beyonc\u00e9 was more interested in his experimental material, and he reluctantly played her his song \"[[Haunted (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Haunted]]\" on his cellphone. She refused to ignore its potential. At a later meeting, he played her a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] rap called \"Ghost\", which he wrote after an exasperating meeting with a potential record label. Boots began by composing a [[melody]] that reminded him of a hypnotic state, then layering guitar [[arpeggios]] to resemble the work of English electronic musician [[Aphex Twin]].

solo album by American singer [[Beyonc\u00e9]]. The record was released on December 13, 2013, by [[Parkwood Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]]. Developed as a \"visual album\", its songs are accompanied by non-linear short films that illustrate the musical concepts conceived during production. Its dark, intimate subject material includes [[feminist]] themes of [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[Monogamy|monogamous love]], and relationship issues, inspired by Beyonc\u00e9's desire to assert her full creative freedom. ''Beyonc\u00e9'' is credited for changing the general release date for music from Monday to Friday.\n\nThe album's initial recording began in [[New York City]], where Beyonc\u00e9 invited producers and songwriters to live with her for a month. During extensive touring the following year, the album changed as she conceived of creating a visual accompaniment to its songs and resumed recording sessions with [[Electronic music|electronic]] producer and [[Rock music|rock]] musician [[Boots (musician)|Boots]]. Their collaboration led to more sonically [[Experimental music|experimental]] material, which combined [[contemporary R&B]] with electronic and [[soul music]]. Throughout this period, the album's songs and videos were composed in strict secrecy as Beyonc\u00e9 devised an unexpected release.\n\n''Beyonc\u00e9'' was released digitally on the [[iTunes Store]] without prior announcement or promotion, and debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], earning Beyonc\u00e9 her fifth consecutive number-one album on the chart. The album sold over 617,000 copies in the United States and 828,773 copies worldwide in its first three days of sales, becoming the fastest-selling album in the history of the iTunes Store up to that point.<ref>{{cite news|first=Clarisse|last=Loughrey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/adeles-album-is-no1-in-almost-every-country-in-the-world-a6749626.html|title=Adele's new album 25 is No.1 on iTunes in almost every country in the world|date=November 26, 2015|work=Independent|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref> According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Beyonc\u00e9'' was globally the tenth-best-selling album of 2013.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|title=Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 26, 2014|page=12}}</ref> It received universal acclaim from critics, who praised its production, exploration of sexuality, and vocal performance. The album was [[reissue]]d in November 2014 as part of a [[Beyonc\u00e9: Platinum Edition|platinum edition]], along with an [[More (Beyonc\u00e9 EP)|extended play]] of new songs, and has sold over <!--please, don't inflate the number-->10 million copies worldwide.

In an interview for ''Pitchfork'' after the album's release, Boots was coy when answering questions about how Beyonc\u00e9 discovered his demo or of his work previous to the project, only confirming his signing. In June 2013, they met in person for the first time and Boots presented Beyonc\u00e9 with material he felt would resonate with her. However, Beyonc\u00e9 was more interested in his experimental material, and he reluctantly played her his song \"[[Haunted (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Haunted]]\" on his cellphone. She refused to ignore its potential. At a later meeting, he played her a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] rap called \"Ghost\", which he wrote after an exasperating meeting with a potential record label. Boots began by composing a [[melody]] that reminded him of a hypnotic state, then layering guitar [[arpeggios]] to resemble the work of English electronic musician [[Aphex Twin]]. Subsequently, \"Ghost\" became the first half of \"Haunted\"; he later described Beyonc\u00e9 as the \"only visionary in the room\" for her ability to find potential in scraps of songs.
