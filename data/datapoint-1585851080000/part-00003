She was launched in January 1794 as ''Vengeance'' and completed for service in the following April. The French commissioned her as a corvette and initially armed her with 26 guns: twenty-two 8-pounders on her upper deck and four 4-pounders on her galliards, i.e. her [[quarterdeck]] and [[forecastle]]. \n\nBetween 24 March 1794 and 14 September she was under the command of ''lieutenant de vaisseau'' Pimare. While under his command she sailed from Bordeaux to [[Brest (France)| Brest]] and Dunkirk. \n\n''Vengeance'' was renamed ''V\u00e9nus'' in May 1795.{{sfnp|Winfield|2008|pp=267-8}} She was at Brest in 1795 under the command of ''lieutenant de vaisseau'' Desagenaux. At some point she carried dispatches to [[Saint-Domingue]].\n\nBy 1796 she had had 4 [[obusier de vaisseau|''obusiers'']] added on her gaillards. Desagneaux, promoted to ''capitaine de fr\u00e9gate'' commanded ''V\u00e9nus'' from 28 April 1796 to 14 June. ''lieutenants de vaisseau'' Pinsan and Landolphe succeeded him. During this time she sailed back from Saint-Domingue to Bordeaux, and then on to Rochefort. She carried troops and funds to Cayenne and Guadeloupe.\n\n''V\u00e9nus'' took part in the [[Exp\u00e9dition d'Irlande]] in 1796. \n\nBy July 1798 the ''obusiers'' had been removed and she carried ten 4-pounder guns on her galliards.\n\nUnder the command of ''capitaine de fr\u00e9gate'' [[Louis-Andr\u00e9 Senez]], ''V\u00e9nus'' was in Commodore Savary's squadron at the [[Battle of Tory Island]]. She sailed from [[La Rochelle]] to [[Killala Bay]], and then by 7 November had returned to [[\u00cele-d'Aix]] [[Roadstead|Roads]].\n\nFrom 21 May 1800 ''V\u00e9nus'' was under the command of capitaine de fr\u00e9gate Bourrand. At some point she left Rochefort on a mission to S\u00e9n\u00e9gal. She was off the Iberian Peninsula when the [[Royal Navy]] captured her.\n\n==Capture==\nOn 22 October 1800 {{HMS|Indefatigable|1784|2}} captured ''V\u00e9nus'' off the Portuguese coast.<ref name=LG15308/> ''Indefatigable'' had been chasing ''Venus'' from the morning when in the afternoon {{HMS|Fisgard|1797|2}} came in sight and forced ''V\u00e9nus'' to turn.

She was designed for short-range privateering in the Channel and the Bay of Biscay, rather than the longer-range escort or patrol work of a British sloop. Accordingly, she couldn't stow as much in the way of stores as the Admiralty needed; reducing her armament, relative to her French establishment, would have permitted her to carry the larger weight of stores she had to carry in RN service.\n\n==HMS ''Scout''==\nThe [[Royal Navy]] commissioned ''V\u00e9nus'' as ''Scout'' in November 1800 under Commander George Ormsby.{{sfnp|Winfield|2008|pp=267-8}} She was fitted out at Plymouth until March 1801.
