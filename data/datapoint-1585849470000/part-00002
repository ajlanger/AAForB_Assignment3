This demerit system is mediated by a \"demerit card\" that all students must have on them during school hours.  Each semester, students are issued a demerit card with spaces for 40 demerits.

Students may choose to opt-out of this punishment once per semester if they choose to instead take a \"work Jug\", which entails providing an adequate service alternative by aiding staff and teachers.  Repeat or serious offenses will result in a \"Saturday Jug\", a 4-hour detention during the weekend issue by the Dean of Students.  On average, students receive approximately 5 demerits, or one Jug, per semester.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.creightonprep.creighton.edu/page.cfm?p=5130|title=Creighton Prep: FAQs for Parents|website=creightonprep.creighton.edu|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref> In the event of a student missing a morning Jug or not completing their homework prior to the class, the student is the assigned to attend \"Laughlin Hour\" (formally referred to as \"Ninth Hour\").

Freshmen and Sophomores who do not meet the requirements must attend six-hour-long, after-school sessions during a period of three weeks where they receive academic help from student volunteers.  After the initial three weeks have ended, the student's grades will be reviewed, if the student is still failing two or more classes then they will be assigned an additional three weeks.  Failure to attend this program will result in a Saturday Jug.<ref name=\":9\" /> If a student does not meet this satisfactory standard by the end of the semester, they will be placed into academic probation for the following semester or could be potentially dismissed depending on the severity of their performance.

This demerit system is mediated by a \"demerit card\" that all students must have on them during school hours.  Each semester, students are issued a demerit card with spaces for 40 demerits.  At 5 demerit intervals, a student will receive a detention, referred to as a \"Jug\" (standing for Justice Under God)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omaha.com/news/kelly-creighton-prep-losing-a-living-saint/article_6b1b8769-4bc6-5f62-bbb2-7ff4188696c0.html|title=Kelly: Creighton Prep losing a 'living saint'|last=columnist|first=Michael Kelly / World-Herald|website=Omaha.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>.

Students may choose to opt-out of this punishment once per semester if they choose to instead take a \"work Jug\", which entails providing an adequate service alternative by aiding staff and teachers.  Repeat or serious offenses will result in a \"Saturday Jug\", a 4-hour detention during the weekend issue by the Dean of Students.

Therefore, individual schools have are responsible for maintaining these standards but \"what\u2019s appropriate is up to the schools\" (Jim Tenopir).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omaha.com/news/education/are-students-going-too-far-in-the-way-they-boo/article_1c9bd474-7d09-52c4-a771-dde842f1f8f8.html|title=Are students going too far in the way they boo?
