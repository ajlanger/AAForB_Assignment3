It is a garbage excuse for a song, designed to appeal to edgy middle schoolers, about starting a fight. It reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] (one week on July 26, 2003) and [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock]] (five weeks on May 31, 2003) charts and No. 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as No. 1 on the singles recurrent charts. It crossed over to mainstream pop radio, peaking at No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Top 40]]. The song also won two [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]] in 2003 for \"Best Modern Rock Track\" and \"Best Rock Track\".\n\n\"Headstrong\" was rated the No. 1 alternative song and No. 8 rock song of the decade of the 2000s by ''Billboard''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20100114193935/http://www.billboard.com//]\n\nIn 2018, an official poll by [[Ultimate Guitar]] saw the site's users rate \"Headstrong\" as having the fourth worst [[Ostinato#Riff|riff]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/articles/features/friday_top_15_worst_riffs_of_all_time-72685 |title=Friday Top: 15 Worst Riffs of All Time |date=2 Mar 2018 |accessdate=27 Mar 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nA [[music video]] was produced for \"Headstrong\" which largely focuses on the band performing in front of a crowd. Paper and other debris are seen flying past in furious winds as the group plays in an urban nighttime setting, as well as a couple of teenagers arguing with the people they know, such as one teen getting into an argument with his father while they are in a car and the kid becomes fed up with his Dad's attitude and storms off as well as another teen quitting his job at a restaurant after getting pushed around by his boss. The two teens then join Trapt in the crowd. The video found considerable airplay on [[MTV2]] and [[Fuse (TV channel)|MMUSA]] upon release. The video was directed by Brian Scott Weber.\n\n==Track listing==\n# \"Headstrong\" \u2013 4:46\n# \"Promise\" \u2013 3:49\n# \"Hollowman\" \u2013 5:03\n\nTotal Length: 13:38\n\n==Charts==\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
