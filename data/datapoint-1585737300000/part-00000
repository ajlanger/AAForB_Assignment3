In order for Russian nationals to compete at the World Athletics Championship (from 2017 on), they must be approved as authorised neutral athletes by the IAAF. Prior to 1993, Russian athletes competed for the [[Soviet Union at the World Championships in Athletics|Soviet Union]]. Russia has the second-highest medal total among nations at the competition (153), after the [[United States at the World Championships in Athletics|United States]]. At 47 [[gold medals]], it holds the third-highest total after the United States and [[Kenya at the World Championships in Athletics|Kenya]]. It has had the most success in women's events and in field events. As a major nation in the [[sport of athletics]], it typically sent a delegation numbering over 100 athletes.\n\nIt topped the medal table at the [[2001 World Championships in Athletics|2001 tournament]]. Russia also finished top of the medal table at the [[2013 World Championships in Athletics|2013 Moscow Championships]], but lost this position due to doping disqualifications of its athletes. Russia's performance at the competition has been strongly affected by doping. The country was banned from competing in 2017 due to systemic doping issues and Russians had to gain special dispensation to compete as [[Authorised Neutral Athletes]].<ref>[https://www.iaaf.org/news/press-release/russians-neutral-athletes-2017 IAAF approves the application of seven Russians to compete internationally as neutral athletes].

Women's [[pole vault]]er [[Yelena Isinbayeva]] has also won three gold medals, in addition to a bronze. [[Yuliya Pechonkina]], a [[400 metres hurdles]] and relay athlete, has won the most medals for Russia, with her total of seven.
