the freight sector in the UK, has identified three key technical innovations already in use in [[Rail freight transport|rail freight]].<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite

Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=gov.uk.dft|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> These include [[timetable]] advisory systems which allow drivers to track train progress against timetables via software hosted on tablets, freight collaborative decision-making systems which offer real-time information on arrivals of freight services, and mobile consisting applications which reduce the amount of information sent manually to relevant parties and authorities by collecting information and transmitting it directly.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nHowever, advancements in rail freight technology have progressed more slowly than in other sectors due to the decades-long life cycles of [[locomotive]]s and [[Railroad car|railcars]]<ref name=\":11\" /> and the lack of power supply in [[Goods wagon|freight cars]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/connected-freight-trains-are-better-freight-trains-43171.html|title=Connected

American rail system]] was mandated by [[United States Congress|Congress]] to include automated safety overrides after a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 commuter train accident]], laying the

[[smart port]]s around the world are increasing capacity and efficiency for shippers, ports, and [[Freight forwarder|freight forwarding]] partners, such as trucking carriers.<ref name=\":10\" /> Reductions in labour and machinery costs can be seen at ports thanks to improvements in automated and semi-automated [[Crane (machine)|cranes]], which reduce the need for yard transfer vehicles.<ref

intermodal freight transport by streamlining communication, documentation, and dispute resolution across various industry players as cargo changes hands.<ref name=\":16\" /> Freight technology offers a way to increase transparency across industry players at each step of the supply chain. [[Smart contract]]s, for example, can use information collected by data loggers, such as temperature data on cold chain shipments, to resolve or dispute a contract depending on whether the agreed upon terms of shipping have been followed.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n== See also ==\n===Traditional areas of FreightTech===\n* [[Freight exchange|Freight Exchanges]]\n* [[Transportation management system|Transportation Management Systems]]\n* [[Conveyancing]]\n* [[Application programming interface]]s\n\n=== Areas of growth in the FreightTech sector ===\n* [[Distributed ledger]]s\n* Advanced [[machine learning]]\n* [[Smart port]]s\n* [[Smart contract]]s\n* [[Blockchain]]\n* [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]] (IoT)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Freight transport]]\n[[Category:Shipping]]\n[[Category:Maritime transport]]\n[[Category:Supply chain management]]\n[[Category:Internet of things]]\n[[Category:Logistics]]\n", "name_user": "NegiGaurav", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_technology"}
