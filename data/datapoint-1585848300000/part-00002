In reflection to the evolutionary origin of its codon, the other AUN codons encode isoleucine, which is also a hydrophobic amino acid. In the mitochondrial genome of several organisms, including [[Vertebrate mitochondrial code|metazoa]] and [[The yeast mitochondrial code|yeast]], the codon AUA also encodes for methionine.

A \"Start\" codon is message for a [[ribosome]] that signals the initiation of protein [[Translation (biology)|translation]] from mRNA when the AUG codon is in a [[Kozak consensus sequence]]. As a consequence, methionine is often incorporated into the N-terminal position of [[protein]]s in [[eukaryote]]s and [[archaea]] during translation, although it can be removed by [[post-translational modification]]. In [[bacteria]], the derivative [[N-Formylmethionine|''N''-formylmethionine]] is used as the initial amino acid.\n\n==Derivatives==\n\n===''S''-adenosyl-methionine===\n[[File:S-Adenosyl-L-methionin.svg|thumbnail|left|''S''-Adenosyl-methionine is a cofactor derived from methionine.]]\n{{main|S-adenosyl methionine}}\nThe methionine-derivative [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM) is a cofactor that serves mainly as a [[methyl]] donor. SAM is composed of an adenosyl molecule (via 5' carbon) attached to the sulfur of methionine, therefore making it a [[sulfonium]] cation (i.e., three substituents and positive charge). The sulfur acts as a [[HSAB theory|soft Lewis acid]] (i.e., donor/electrophile) which allows the ''S''-methyl group to be transferred to an oxygen, nitrogen, or aromatic system, often with the aid of other cofactors such as [[cobalamin]] (vitamin B12 in humans). Some enzymes use SAM to initiate a radical reaction; these are called [[radical SAM]] enzymes.\nAs a result of the transfer of the methyl group, S-adenosyl-homocysteine is obtained. In bacteria, this is either regenerated by methylation or is salvaged by removing the adenine and the homocysteine, leaving the compound dihydroxypentandione to spontaneously convert into [[autoinducer-2]], which is excreted as a waste product / quorum signal.\n\n== Biosynthesis ==\n[[File:Met biosynthesis.svg|thumb|550px|Methionine biosynthesis]]\nAs an essential amino acid, methionine is not synthesized [[De novo synthesis|''de novo'']] in humans and other animals, which must ingest methionine or methionine-containing proteins.  In plants and microorganisms, methionine biosynthesis belongs to the [[aspartate]] family, along with threonine and [[lysine]] (via [[diaminopimelate]], but not via [[Alpha-Aminoadipic acid|\u03b1-aminoadipate]]). The main backbone is derived from [[aspartic acid]], while the sulfur may come from [[cysteine]], [[methanethiol]], or [[hydrogen sulfide]].<ref name=review/>\n* First, aspartic acid is converted via \u03b2-aspartyl-semialdehyde into [[homoserine]] by two reduction steps of the terminal carboxyl group (homoserine has therefore a \u03b3-hydroxyl, hence the [[homologous series|homo-]] series). The intermediate aspartate-semialdehyde is the branching point with the lysine biosynthetic pathway, where it is instead [[Aldol condensation|condensed]] with pyruvate. Homoserine is the branching point with the threonine pathway, where instead it is isomerised after activating the terminal hydroxyl with phosphate (also used for methionine biosynthesis in plants).<ref name=review/>\n* Homoserine is then activated with a phosphate, succinyl or an acetyl group on the hydroxyl.\n** In plants and possibly in some bacteria,<ref name=review/> phosphate is used. This step is shared with threonine biosynthesis.<ref name=review/>\n** In most organisms, an acetyl group is used to activate the homoserine. This can be catalysed in bacteria by an enzyme encoded by ''metX'' or ''metA'' (not homologues).<ref name=review/> \n** In [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]] and a limited number of other organisms, succinate is used. The enzyme that catalyses the reaction is MetA and the specificity for acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is dictated by a single reside.<ref name=review/> The physiological basis for the preference of acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA is unknown, but such alternative routes are present in some other pathways (''e.g.'' lysine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis).\n* The hydroxyl activating group is then replaced with cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide. A replacement reaction is technically a \u03b3-[[Elimination reaction|elimination]] followed by a variant of a [[Michael addition]]. All the enzymes involved are homologues and members of the [[Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent enzyme family]], which is a subset of the PLP-dependent fold type I clade. They utilise the cofactor PLP ([[pyridoxal phosphate]]), which functions by stabilising carbanion intermediates.<ref name=review/> \n** If it reacts with cysteine, it produces [[cystathionine]], which is cleaved to yield [[homocysteine]]. The enzymes involved are [[cystathionine-\u03b3-synthase]] (encoded by ''metB'' in bacteria) and [[cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase]] (''metC''). Cystathionine is bound differently in the two enzymes allowing \u03b2 or \u03b3 reactions to occur.<ref name=review/> \n** If it reacts with free hydrogen sulfide, it produces homocysteine. This is catalysed by [[O-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase|''O''-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase]] (formerly known as ''O''-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase. It is encoded by either ''metY'' or ''metZ'' in bacteria.<ref name=review/> \n** If it reacts with  methanethiol, it produces methionine directly. Methanethiol is a byproduct of catabolic pathway of certain compounds, therefore this route is more uncommon.<ref name=review/> \n* If homocysteine is produced, the thiol group is methylated, yielding methionine. Two [[methionine synthase]]s are known; one is [[cobalamin]] (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) dependent and one is independent.<ref name=review/>\n\nThe pathway using cysteine is called the \"[[transsulfuration pathway]]\", while the pathway using hydrogen sulfide (or methanethiol) is called \"direct-sulfurylation pathway\".\n\nCysteine is similarly produced, namely it can be made from an activated serine and either from homocysteine (\"reverse trans-sulfurylation route\") or from hydrogen sulfide (\"direct sulfurylation route\"); the activated serine is generally ''O''-acetyl-serine (via CysK or CysM in ''E. coli''), but in ''[[Aeropyrum pernix]]'' and some other archaea ''O''-phosphoserine is used.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mino K, Ishikawa K | title = A novel O-phospho-L-serine sulfhydrylation reaction catalyzed by O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase from Aeropyrum pernix K1 | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 551 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = 133\u20138 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12965218 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-5793(03)00913-X }}</ref> CysK and CysM are homologues, but belong to the PLP fold type III clade.\n\n===Trans-sulfurylation pathway===\n{{main|Transsulfuration pathway}}\nEnzymes involved in the ''E. coli'' trans-sulfurylation route of methionine biosynthesis:\n# [[Aspartokinase]]\n# [[Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase]]\n# [[Homoserine dehydrogenase]]\n# [[Homoserine O-transsuccinylase]]\n# [[Cystathionine-\u03b3-synthase]]\n# [[Cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase]]\n# [[Methionine synthase]] (in mammals, this step is performed by [[homocysteine methyltransferase]] or [[betaine\u2014homocysteine S-methyltransferase]].)\n\n== Other biochemical pathways ==\n[[File:Met pathway.svg|thumb|Fates of methionine|400px|Fates of methionine]]\nAlthough mammals cannot synthesize methionine, they can still use it in a variety of biochemical pathways:\n\n===Catabolism===\nMethionine is converted to [[S-adenosylmethionine]] (SAM) by (1) [[methionine adenosyltransferase]].\n\nSAM serves as a methyl-donor in many (2) [[methyltransferase]] reactions, and is converted to [[S-adenosylhomocysteine|''S''-adenosylhomocysteine]] (SAH).\n\n(3) [[Adenosylhomocysteinase]] converts SAH to [[homocysteine]].\n\nHomocysteine can be used to regenerate methionine or to form cysteine.\n\n===Regeneration===\nMethionine can be regenerated from homocysteine via (4) [[methionine synthase]] in a reaction that requires [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].\n\nHomocysteine can also be remethylated using [[glycine betaine]] (NNN-trimethyl glycine, TMG) to methionine via the enzyme [[betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase]] (E.C.2.1.1.5, BHMT).  BHMT makes up to 1.5% of all the soluble protein of the liver, and recent evidence suggests that it may have a greater influence on methionine and homocysteine homeostasis than methionine synthase.\n\n===Reverse-transulfurylation pathway: conversion to cysteine===\nHomocysteine can be converted to cysteine.\n\n* (5) [[Cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase]] (an enzyme which requires the active form of [[vitamin B6]], [[pyridoxal phosphate]]) combines homocysteine and serine to produce [[cystathionine]].  Instead of degrading [[cystathionine]] via [[cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase]], as in the biosynthetic pathway, cystathionine is broken down to [[cysteine]] and [[\u03b1-ketobutyrate]] via (6) [[cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase]].\n* (7) The enzyme [[\u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase]] converts \u03b1-ketobutyrate to [[propionyl-CoA]], which is metabolized to [[succinyl-CoA]] in a three-step process (see [[propionyl-CoA]] for pathway).\n\n===Ethylene synthesis===\nThis [[amino acid]] is also used by [[plant]]s for synthesis of [[ethylene]].

A \"Start\" codon is message for a [[ribosome]] that signals the initiation of protein [[Translation (biology)|translation]] from mRNA when the AUG codon is in a [[Kozak consensus sequence]]. As a consequence, methionine is often incorporated into the N-terminal position of [[protein]]s in [[eukaryote]]s and [[archaea]] during translation, although it can be removed by [[post-translational modification]]. In [[bacteria]], the derivative [[N-Formylmethionine|''N''-formylmethionine]] is used as the initial amino acid.\n\n==Derivatives==\n\n===''S''-adenosyl-methionine===\n[[File:S-Adenosyl-L-methionin.svg|thumbnail|left|''S''-Adenosyl-methionine is a cofactor derived from methionine.]]\n{{main|S-adenosyl methionine}}\nThe methionine-derivative [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM) is a cofactor that serves mainly as a [[methyl]] donor. SAM is composed of an adenosyl molecule (via 5' carbon) attached to the sulfur of methionine, therefore making it a [[sulfonium]] cation (i.e., three substituents and positive charge). The sulfur acts as a [[HSAB theory|soft Lewis acid]] (i.e., donor/electrophile) which allows the ''S''-methyl group to be transferred to an oxygen, nitrogen, or aromatic system, often with the aid of other cofactors such as [[cobalamin]] (vitamin B12 in humans). Some enzymes use SAM to initiate a radical reaction; these are called [[radical SAM]] enzymes.\nAs a result of the transfer of the methyl group, S-adenosyl-homocysteine is obtained. In bacteria, this is either regenerated by methylation or is salvaged by removing the adenine and the homocysteine, leaving the compound dihydroxypentandione to spontaneously convert into [[autoinducer-2]], which is excreted as a waste product / quorum signal.\n\n== Biosynthesis ==\n[[File:Met biosynthesis.svg|thumb|550px|Methionine biosynthesis]]\nAs an essential amino acid, methionine is not synthesized [[De novo synthesis|''de novo'']] in humans and other animals, which must ingest methionine or methionine-containing proteins.  In plants and microorganisms, methionine biosynthesis belongs to the [[aspartate]] family, along with threonine and [[lysine]] (via [[diaminopimelate]], but not via [[Alpha-Aminoadipic acid|\u03b1-aminoadipate]]). The main backbone is derived from [[aspartic acid]], while the sulfur may come from [[cysteine]], [[methanethiol]], or [[hydrogen sulfide]].<ref name=review/>\n* First, aspartic acid is converted via \u03b2-aspartyl-semialdehyde into [[homoserine]] by two reduction steps of the terminal carboxyl group (homoserine has therefore a \u03b3-hydroxyl, hence the [[homologous series|homo-]] series). The intermediate aspartate-semialdehyde is the branching point with the lysine biosynthetic pathway, where it is instead [[Aldol condensation|condensed]] with pyruvate. Homoserine is the branching point with the threonine pathway, where instead it is isomerised after activating the terminal hydroxyl with phosphate (also used for methionine biosynthesis in plants).<ref name=review/>\n* Homoserine is then activated with a phosphate, succinyl or an acetyl group on the hydroxyl.\n** In plants and possibly in some bacteria,<ref name=review/> phosphate is used. This step is shared with threonine biosynthesis.<ref name=review/>\n** In most organisms, an acetyl group is used to activate the homoserine. This can be catalysed in bacteria by an enzyme encoded by ''metX'' or ''metA'' (not homologues).<ref name=review/> \n** In [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]] and a limited number of other organisms, succinate is used. The enzyme that catalyses the reaction is MetA and the specificity for acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is dictated by a single reside.<ref name=review/> The physiological basis for the preference of acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA is unknown, but such alternative routes are present in some other pathways (''e.g.'' lysine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis).\n* The hydroxyl activating group is then replaced with cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide. A replacement reaction is technically a \u03b3-[[Elimination reaction|elimination]] followed by a variant of a [[Michael addition]]. All the enzymes involved are homologues and members of the [[Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent enzyme family]], which is a subset of the PLP-dependent fold type I clade. They utilise the cofactor PLP ([[pyridoxal phosphate]]), which functions by stabilising carbanion intermediates.<ref name=review/> \n** If it reacts with cysteine, it produces [[cystathionine]], which is cleaved to yield [[homocysteine]]. The enzymes involved are [[cystathionine-\u03b3-synthase]] (encoded by ''metB'' in bacteria) and [[cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase]] (''metC''). Cystathionine is bound differently in the two enzymes allowing \u03b2 or \u03b3 reactions to occur.<ref name=review/> \n** If it reacts with free hydrogen sulfide, it produces homocysteine. This is catalysed by [[O-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase|''O''-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase]] (formerly known as ''O''-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase. It is encoded by either ''metY'' or ''metZ'' in bacteria.<ref name=review/> \n** If it reacts with  methanethiol, it produces methionine directly. Methanethiol is a byproduct of catabolic pathway of certain compounds, therefore this route is more uncommon.<ref name=review/> \n* If homocysteine is produced, the thiol group is methylated, yielding methionine. Two [[methionine synthase]]s are known; one is [[cobalamin]] (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) dependent and one is independent.<ref name=review/>\n\nThe pathway using cysteine is called the \"[[transsulfuration pathway]]\", while the pathway using hydrogen sulfide (or methanethiol) is called \"direct-sulfurylation pathway\".\n\nCysteine is similarly produced, namely it can be made from an activated serine and either from homocysteine (\"reverse trans-sulfurylation route\") or from hydrogen sulfide (\"direct sulfurylation route\"); the activated serine is generally ''O''-acetyl-serine (via CysK or CysM in ''E. coli''), but in ''[[Aeropyrum pernix]]'' and some other archaea ''O''-phosphoserine is used.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mino K, Ishikawa K | title = A novel O-phospho-L-serine sulfhydrylation reaction catalyzed by O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase from Aeropyrum pernix K1 | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 551 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = 133\u20138 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12965218 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-5793(03)00913-X }}</ref> CysK and CysM are homologues, but belong to the PLP fold type III clade.\n\n===Trans-sulfurylation pathway===\n{{main|Transsulfuration pathway}}\nEnzymes involved in the ''E. coli'' trans-sulfurylation route of methionine biosynthesis:\n# [[Aspartokinase]]\n# [[Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase]]\n# [[Homoserine dehydrogenase]]\n# [[Homoserine O-transsuccinylase]]\n# [[Cystathionine-\u03b3-synthase]]\n# [[Cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase]]\n# [[Methionine synthase]] (in mammals, this step is performed by [[homocysteine methyltransferase]] or [[betaine\u2014homocysteine S-methyltransferase]].)\n\n== Other biochemical pathways ==\n[[File:Met pathway.svg|thumb|Fates of methionine|400px|Fates of methionine]]\nAlthough mammals cannot synthesize methionine, they can still use it in a variety of biochemical pathways:\n\n===Catabolism===\nMethionine is converted to [[S-adenosylmethionine]] (SAM) by (1) [[methionine adenosyltransferase]].\n\nSAM serves as a methyl-donor in many (2) [[methyltransferase]] reactions, and is converted to [[S-adenosylhomocysteine|''S''-adenosylhomocysteine]] (SAH).\n\n(3) [[Adenosylhomocysteinase]] converts SAH to [[homocysteine]].\n\nHomocysteine can be used to regenerate methionine or to form cysteine.\n\n===Regeneration===\nMethionine can be regenerated from homocysteine via (4) [[methionine synthase]] in a reaction that requires [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].\n\nHomocysteine can also be remethylated using [[glycine betaine]] (NNN-trimethyl glycine, TMG) to methionine via the enzyme [[betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase]] (E.C.2.1.1.5, BHMT).  BHMT makes up to 1.5% of all the soluble protein of the liver, and recent evidence suggests that it may have a greater influence on methionine and homocysteine homeostasis than methionine synthase.\n\n===Reverse-transulfurylation pathway: conversion to cysteine===\nHomocysteine can be converted to cysteine.\n\n* (5) [[Cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase]] (an enzyme which requires the active form of [[vitamin B6]], [[pyridoxal phosphate]]) combines homocysteine and serine to produce [[cystathionine]].  Instead of degrading [[cystathionine]] via [[cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase]], as in the biosynthetic pathway, cystathionine is broken down to [[cysteine]] and [[\u03b1-ketobutyrate]] via (6) [[cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase]].\n* (7) The enzyme [[\u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase]] converts \u03b1-ketobutyrate to [[propionyl-CoA]], which is metabolized to [[succinyl-CoA]] in a three-step process (see [[propionyl-CoA]] for pathway).\n\n===Ethylene synthesis===\nThis [[amino acid]] is also used by [[plant]]s for synthesis of [[ethylene]].

Methionine is also known to increase the urinary excretion of quinidine by acidifying the urine. Aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections work best in alkaline conditions, and urinary acidification from using methionine can reduce its effectiveness. If a dog is on a diet that acidifies the urine, methionine should not be used.<ref>Grimshaw, Jane (July 25, 2011) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140629112302/http://www.critters360.com/index.php/methionine-for-dogs-uses-and-side-effects-3841/ Methionine for Dogs uses and Side Effects]. critters360.com</ref>\n\nMethionine is allowed as a supplement to organic poultry feed under the US certified organic program.<ref>{{Cite journal | title =Rules and Regulations |journal=Federal Register | url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2011/2011-5716.htm | volume= 76|issue= 49 |date=March 14, 2011|pages =13501\u201313504}}</ref>\n\nMethionine can be used as a nontoxic pesticide option against [[Papilio cresphontes|giant swallowtail]] caterpillars, which are a serious pest to orange crops.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewis DS, Cuda JP, Stevens BR | title = A novel biorational pesticide: efficacy of methionine against Heraclides (Papilio) cresphontes, a surrogate of the invasive Princeps (Papilio) demoleus (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) | journal = Journal of Economic Entomology | volume = 104 | issue = 6 | pages = 1986\u201390 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22299361 | doi = 10.1603/ec11132 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Allantoin]]\n* [[Formylmethionine]]\n* [[Methionine oxidation]]\n* [[Paracetamol poisoning#Treatment|Paracetamol poisoning]] \n* [[Photo-reactive amino acid analog|Photoreactive methionine]]\n* [[S-Methylcysteine]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Cite journal | title = Methionine Content of Cereals and Legumes | first1 = M.
