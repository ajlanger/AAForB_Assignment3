Upon investigating further, Karan learns the suspects received money and VHS tapes containing a terrorist's message. Also, one of the suspects talks repeatedly about 9/11, which is decoded as an attack on India on the day of Diwali. Further learning the recordings were shot by a camera in London, Karan decides to go undercover along with Bhavana Reddy, who assisted him on his previous mission. Posing as a married couple, they arrive in London where Mallika Sood, a British Intelligence officer picks them up and takes them to their work station where another agent named Armaan Akhtar assists them. On the other hand, the British Muslim terrorist Buraq Ansari forces his son Abeer to watch him killing a man, due to which Abeer's mother and Buraq's ex wife Zahira wants to contact the police but is threatened by Buraq.

Buraq is freed due to making a deal with the BI; he gives them evidence for a previous attack in exchange for his freedom. On his way to a safe house, Buraq asks the officers to stop at a mosque so that he can pray. He switches places with one of his henchmen and kills Zahira. Realizing the attack would be not on Diwali but before it, Karan decides to continue alone but is joined by his team. Through Abeer's tablet, the safe house is located and attacked by Karan and team. Following the fight that leaves all the henchmen dead, Karan injects Buraq and takes him away as he is unconscious. Bhavana and Mallika rescue Abeer, while Karan is safely picked up by his agency's helicopter and escorted to a cargo ship heading towards India. With minimal time remaining for the attacks, Karan and the police try to find the targeted cities. Decoding \"ALLAH\" spoken repeatedly by Buraq, Karan finds the targeted cities and releases a video requesting the Muslims of India to understand the value of religious unity. When the good Muslims gear up to face the terrorists, they are joined by the police officers and terrorists are arrested. Karan kills Buraq, and hands over Abeer to the dead suspect's father.\n\n==Cast==\n===''Commando: A One Man Army''===\n* [[Vidyut Jamwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Pooja Chopra]] as Simrit Kaur\n* [[Jaideep Ahlawat]] as Amrit Kanwal ([[AK-74]])\n* [[Jagat Rawat]] as MP Mahendra Pratap\n* [[Darshan Jariwala]] as Colonel  Akhilesh Sinha, Karan's Commanding officer\n* [[Nathalia Kaur]] Special appearance (Item song) in \"Mungda\" song\n\n===''Commando 2: The Black Money Trail''===\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Adah Sharma]] as Inspector Bhavna Reddy\n* [[Esha Gupta]] as Maria, later real Vicky Chaddha \n* Vansh Bharadwaj as Maria's husband and fake Vicky Chaddha\n* [[Freddy Daruwala]] as ACP Bakhtawar Khan\n* [[Suhail Nayyar]] as Dishank Chowdhury\n* [[Thakur Anoop Singh]] as K.P\n* [[Shefali Shah]] as Leena Chowdhury\n* [[Satish Kaushik]] as Dhariwal Ranwal\n* [[Ivan Sylvester Rodrigues|Ivan Rodrigues]] as Kamath\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Karan's Boss\n* Kannan Arunachalam as Shrinath Iyer\n* Siddharth Kher as Jimmy Kher\n* Avisha Sharma as Tara\n* [[Sumit Gulati]] as Zafar Hussain, the hacktivist\n\n===''Commando 3''===\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Adah Sharma]] as Agent Bhavana Reddy \n* [[Angira Dhar]] as British Intelligence Agent Mallika Sood \n* [[Gulshan Devaiah]] as Buraq Ansari\n* Sumeet Thakur as British Intelligence Agent Armaan Akhtar\n* [[Rajesh Tailang]] as Roy\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Ahmed\n* [[Vibhawari Deshpande]] as Rajani\n* [[Feryna Wazheir]] as Zahira\n* Suresh Vishwakarma as Inspector Tambe\n* R.

While the mother and son are being escorted safely to the airport for India, Buraq's henchmen attack the vehicles. Bhavana is knocked out in the crash while Karan and Mallika fight off the henchmen. However, Zahira and Abeer are kidnapped and Mallika is informed about Buraq's surrender. Karan tries to interrogate him but ends up using force due to which he is ordered to leave London within 24 hours. Buraq is freed due to making a deal with the BI; he gives them evidence for a previous attack in exchange for his freedom. On his way to a safe house, Buraq asks the officers to stop at a mosque so that he can pray. He switches places with one of his henchmen and kills Zahira. Realizing the attack would be not on Diwali but before it, Karan decides to continue alone but is joined by his team. Through Abeer's tablet, the safe house is located and attacked by Karan and team. Following the fight that leaves all the henchmen dead, Karan injects Buraq and takes him away as he is unconscious. Bhavana and Mallika rescue Abeer, while Karan is safely picked up by his agency's helicopter and escorted to a cargo ship heading towards India. With minimal time remaining for the attacks, Karan and the police try to find the targeted cities. Decoding \"ALLAH\" spoken repeatedly by Buraq, Karan finds the targeted cities and releases a video requesting the Muslims of India to understand the value of religious unity. When the good Muslims gear up to face the terrorists, they are joined by the police officers and terrorists are arrested. Karan kills Buraq, and hands over Abeer to the dead suspect's father.\n\n==Cast==\n===''Commando: A One Man Army''===\n* [[Vidyut Jamwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Pooja Chopra]] as Simrit Kaur\n* [[Jaideep Ahlawat]] as Amrit Kanwal ([[AK-74]])\n* [[Jagat Rawat]] as MP Mahendra Pratap\n* [[Darshan Jariwala]] as Colonel  Akhilesh Sinha, Karan's Commanding officer\n* [[Nathalia Kaur]] Special appearance (Item song) in \"Mungda\" song\n\n===''Commando 2: The Black Money Trail''===\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Adah Sharma]] as Inspector Bhavna Reddy\n* [[Esha Gupta]] as Maria, later real Vicky Chaddha \n* Vansh Bharadwaj as Maria's husband and fake Vicky Chaddha\n* [[Freddy Daruwala]] as ACP Bakhtawar Khan\n* [[Suhail Nayyar]] as Dishank Chowdhury\n* [[Thakur Anoop Singh]] as K.P\n* [[Shefali Shah]] as Leena Chowdhury\n* [[Satish Kaushik]] as Dhariwal Ranwal\n* [[Ivan Sylvester Rodrigues|Ivan Rodrigues]] as Kamath\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Karan's Boss\n* Kannan Arunachalam as Shrinath Iyer\n* Siddharth Kher as Jimmy Kher\n* Avisha Sharma as Tara\n* [[Sumit Gulati]] as Zafar Hussain, the hacktivist\n\n===''Commando 3''===\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Adah Sharma]] as Agent Bhavana Reddy \n* [[Angira Dhar]] as British Intelligence Agent Mallika Sood \n* [[Gulshan Devaiah]] as Buraq Ansari\n* Sumeet Thakur as British Intelligence Agent Armaan Akhtar\n* [[Rajesh Tailang]] as Roy\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Ahmed\n* [[Vibhawari Deshpande]] as Rajani\n* [[Feryna Wazheir]] as Zahira\n* Suresh Vishwakarma as Inspector Tambe\n* R.
