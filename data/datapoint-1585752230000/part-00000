{"title_page": "Vampire number", "text_new": "{{No footnotes|date=September 2010}}\nIn [[number theory]], a '''vampire number''' (or '''true vampire number''') is a [[composite number|composite]] [[natural number]] with an even number of [[numerical digit|digits]], that can be factored into two natural numbers each with half as many digits as the original number and not both with trailing zeroes, where the two factors contain precisely all the digits of the original number, in any order, counting multiplicity. The first vampire number is 1260 = 21 \u00d7 60.\n\n== Definition ==\nLet <math>N</math> be a naturalal number with <math>2k</math> digits:\n\n<math>N = {n_{2k}}{n_{2k-1}}...{n_1}</math>\n\nThen <>N</math> is a vampire number if and only if there exist two natural numbers <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>, each with <math>k</math> digits:\n\n<math>A = {a_k}{a_{k-1}}...{a_1}</math>\n\n<math>B = {b_k}{b_{k-1}}...{b_1}</math>\n\nsuch that <math>A \\times B = N</math>, <math>a_1</math> and <math>b_1</math> are not both zero, and the <math>2k</math> digits of the [[concatenation]] of <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> <math>({a_k}{a_{k-1}}...{a_2}{a_1}{b_k}{b_{k-1}}...{b_2}{b_1})</math> are a [[permutation]] of the <math>2k</math> digits of <math>N</math>. The two numbers <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are called the ''fangs'' of <math>N</math>.\n\nFor example: 1260 is a vampire number, with 21 and 60 as fangs, since 21 \u00d7 60 = 1260 and the digits of the concatenation of the two factors (2160) are a permutation of the digits of the original number (1260). However, 126000 (which can be expressed as 21 \u00d7 6000 or 210 \u00d7 600) is not, as 21 and 6000 do not have the correct number of digits, and both 210 and 600 have trailing zeroes.  Similarly, 1023 (which can be expressed as 31 \u00d7 33) is not, because although 1023 contains all the digits of 31 and 33, the four digits of the pair (3133) is not a permutation of the digits of the original number.\n\nVampire numbers were first described in a 1994 post by [[Clifford A. Pickover]] to the [[Usenet]] group sci.math, and the article he later wrote was published in chapter 30 of his book ''Keys to Infinity''.\n\n== Examples ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em;\"\n|+\n!| ''n'' !!
