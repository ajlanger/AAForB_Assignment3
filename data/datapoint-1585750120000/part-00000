Following the sale of the railroad business, Murry proposed a plan to get a new start for his family by moving to Texas and becoming a rancher. Maud disagreed with this proposition, however, and they moved instead to [[Oxford, Mississippi]], where Murry's father owned several businesses, making it easy for Murry to find work.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Minter, David L.

Both his mother and grandmother were avid readers as well as painters and photographers, educating him in visual language. While Murry enjoyed the outdoors and encouraged his sons to hunt, track, and fish, Maud valued education and took pleasure in reading and going to church. She taught her sons to read before sending them to public school and exposed them to classics such as [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFaulkner's lifelong education by Callie Barr is central to his novels' preoccupations with the politics of sexuality and race.<ref name=\"Sensibar\">Sensibar, Judith L.

He excelled in the first grade, skipped the second, and did well through the third and fourth grades. However, beginning somewhere in the fourth and fifth grades of his schooling, Faulkner became a much quieter and more withdrawn child. He began to play hooky occasionally and became somewhat indifferent to his schoolwork, instead taking interest in studying the history of Mississippi on his own time beginning in the seventh grade. The decline of his performance in school continued, and Faulkner wound up repeating the eleventh and twelfth grade, never graduating from high school.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFaulkner spent his boyhood listening to stories told to him by his elders including those of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], slavery, the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and the Falkner family. Faulkner's grandfather would also tell him of the exploits of William's great-grandfather and namesake, [[William Clark Falkner]], who was a successful businessman, writer, and Civil War hero. Telling stories about \"Old Colonel\", as his family called him, had already become something of a family pastime when Faulkner was a boy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to one of Faulkner's biographers, by the time William was born, his great-grandfather had \"been enshrined long since as a household deity.\"<ref name=\"Coughlan, Robert 1953a\">Coughlan, pg. 38</ref>\n\nWhen he was 17, Faulkner met [[Phil Stone]], who became an important early influence on his writing. Stone was four years his senior and came from one of Oxford's older families; he was passionate about literature and had already earned bachelor's degrees from [[Yale University|Yale]] and the [[University of Mississippi]]. Faulkner also attended the latter, joined the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity, and pursued his dream to become a writer. Stone read and was impressed by some of Faulkner's early poetry, becoming one of the first to recognize and encourage Faulkner's talent. Stone mentored the young Faulkner, introducing him to the works of writers such as [[James Joyce]], who influenced Faulkner's own writing. In his early 20s, Faulkner gave poems and short stories he had written to Stone in hopes of their being published. Stone would in turn send these to publishers, but they were uniformly rejected.<ref name=\"Coughlan, Robert 1953\"/>\n[[File:William Faulkner in Toronto, Canada (1918).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cadet Faulkner in [[Toronto]], 1918]]\nThe younger Faulkner was greatly influenced by the history of his family and the region in which he lived. Mississippi marked his sense of humor, his sense of the tragic position of \"black and white\" Americans, his characterization of Southern characters, and his timeless themes, including fiercely intelligent people dwelling behind the fa\u00e7ades of [[good ol' boy]]s and simpletons. Unable to join the [[United States Army]] due to his height (he was 5' 5\u00bd\"), Faulkner enlisted in a reservist unit of the [[British Army]] in Toronto.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scrivener|first=Leslie|title=U of T Back Campus Debate Invokes William Faulkner, Morley Callaghan|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=June 9, 2013|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/06/09/u_of_t_back_campus_debate_invokes_william_faulkner_morley_callaghan.html}}</ref>  Despite his claims, records indicate that Faulkner was never actually a member of the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] and never saw active service during the First World War.<ref>{{cite book|title=William Faulkner: Self-Presentation and Performance|last=Watson|first=James G.|year=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-79151-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Faulkner's surname went from \"Falkner\" to '''Faulkner'''. According to one story, a careless typesetter simply made an error. When the misprint appeared on the title page of his first book, Faulkner was asked whether he wanted the change. He supposedly replied, \"Either way suits me.\"<ref>Nelson, Randy F.

He did not write his first novel until 1925. His literary influences are deep and wide. He once stated that he modeled his early writing on the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] in late 18th- and early 19th-century England.<ref name=\"Ole Miss\"/> He attended the [[University of Mississippi]] (\"Ole Miss\") in Oxford, enrolling in 1919, going three semesters before dropping out in November 1920.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olemiss.edu/mwp/dir/faulkner_william|title=University of Mississippi: William Faulkner|publisher=Olemiss.edu|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWilliam was able to attend classes at the university because his father had a job there as a business manager.

This novel drew heavily on the traditions and history of the South, in which Faulkner had been engrossed in his youth. He was extremely proud of the novel upon its completion and he believed it to be a significant step up from his previous two novels. However, when submitted for publication, it was rejected by the publishers Boni & Liveright. Faulkner was devastated by this rejection, but he eventually allowed his literary agent, Ben Wasson, to significantly edit the text, and the novel was published in 1929 as ''[[Sartoris]].''<ref name=\"Porter, Carolyn 2007\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner 2004\"/> (The original version was issued as ''[[Flags in the Dust]]'' in 1973.)\n\nIn the autumn of 1928, just after his 31st birthday, he began working on ''The Sound and the Fury''. He started by writing three short stories about a group of children with the last name Compson, but soon began to feel that the characters he had created might be better suited for a full-length novel. Perhaps as a result of disappointment in the initial rejection of ''Flags in the Dust'', Faulkner had now become indifferent to his publishers and wrote this novel in a much more experimental style. In describing the writing process for this work, Faulkner would later say, ''\"One day I seemed to shut the door between me and all publisher's addresses and book lists. I said to myself, 'Now I can write.'\"''<ref>Porter, Carolyn.

Estelle brought with her two children from her previous marriage to [[Cornell Franklin]] and Faulkner hoped to support his new family as a writer. Faulkner and Estelle later had a daughter, Jill, in 1933. He began writing ''As I Lay Dying'' in 1929 while working night shifts at the [[University of Mississippi Power House]].

Faulkner was also a prolific writer of [[short story|short stories]].\n\nHis first short story collection, ''[[These 13]]'' (1931), includes many of his most acclaimed (and most frequently [[anthology|anthologized]]) stories, including \"[[A Rose for Emily]]\", \"[[Red Leaves]]\", \"[[That Evening Sun]]\", and \"[[Dry September]]\". Faulkner set many of his short stories and novels in [[Yoknapatawpha County]]<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949/faulkner-bio.html The Nobel Prize in Literature 1949: Biography] ''Nobelprize.org''.</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 based on, and nearly geographically identical to, Lafayette County, of which his hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]], is the county seat. Yoknapatawpha was Faulkner's \"postage stamp\", and the bulk of work that it represents is widely considered by critics to amount to one of the most monumental fictional creations in the history of literature. Three of his novels, ''[[The Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Town (Faulkner novel)|The Town]]'' and ''[[The Mansion (novel)|The Mansion]]'', known collectively as the Snopes Trilogy, document the town of Jefferson and its environs, as an extended family headed by Flem Snopes insinuates itself into the lives and psyches of the general populace.<ref>Charlotte Renner, Talking and Writing in Faulkner's Snopes Trilogy, ACADEMIC JOURNAL ARTICLE, The Southern Literary Journal, Vol. 15, No. 1, Fall 1982.</ref>\n\nHis short story \"[[A Rose for Emily]]\" was his first story published in a major magazine, the ''Forum'', but received little attention from the public. After revisions and reissues, it gained popularity and is now considered one of his best.\n\nFaulkner was known for his experimental style with meticulous attention to [[diction]] and [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]]. In contrast to the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] understatement of his contemporary [[Ernest Hemingway]], Faulkner made frequent use of \"[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]\" in his writing, and wrote often highly emotional, subtle, cerebral, complex, and sometimes [[Southern Gothic|Gothic]] or [[Grotesque#In literature|grotesque]] stories of a wide variety of characters including former slaves or descendants of slaves, poor white, agrarian, or working-class Southerners, and Southern aristocrats.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[The Paris Review]]'' in 1956, Faulkner remarked: <blockquote>Let the writer take up surgery or bricklaying if he is interested in technique. There is no mechanical way to get the writing done, no shortcut. The young writer would be a fool to follow a theory. Teach yourself by your own mistakes; people learn only by error. The good artist believes that nobody is good enough to give him advice. He has supreme vanity. No matter how much he admires the old writer, he wants to beat him.</blockquote> Another esteemed Southern writer, [[Flannery O'Connor]], stated that \"the presence alone of Faulkner in our midst makes a great difference in what the writer can and cannot permit himself to do. Nobody wants his mule and wagon stalled on the same track the Dixie Limited is roaring down\".<ref>Levinger, Larry. \"The Prophet Faulkner.\" ''Atlantic Monthly'' 285 (2000): 76.</ref>\n\nFaulkner wrote two volumes of poetry which were published in small printings, ''The Marble Faun'' (1924),<ref>This book shares a title with ''[[The Marble Faun]]'' (1860), one of the novels of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].</ref> and ''A Green Bough'' (1933), and a collection of mystery stories, ''Knight's Gambit'' (1949).\n\n== Legacy ==\nFaulkner's work has been examined by many critics from a wide variety of critical perspectives.\n\nThe [[New Criticism|New Critics]] became very interested in Faulkner's work, with [[Cleanth Brooks]] writing ''The Yoknapatawpha Country'' and Michael Millgate writing ''The Achievement of William Faulkner''. Since then, critics have looked at Faulkner's work using other approaches, such as feminist and psychoanalytic methods.<ref name=\"Faulkner 2004\" /><ref>Wagner-Martin, Linda.

Following the sale of the railroad business, Murry proposed a plan to get a new start for his family by moving to Texas and becoming a rancher. Maud disagreed with this proposition, however, and they moved instead to [[Oxford, Mississippi]], where Murry's father owned several businesses, making it easy for Murry to find work.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Minter, David L.

Both his mother and grandmother were avid readers as well as painters and photographers, educating him in visual language. While Murry enjoyed the outdoors and encouraged his sons to hunt, track, and fish, Maud valued education and took pleasure in reading and going to church. She taught her sons to read before sending them to public school and exposed them to classics such as [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFaulkner's lifelong education by Callie Barr is central to his novels' preoccupations with the politics of sexuality and race.<ref name=\"Sensibar\">Sensibar, Judith L.

He excelled in the first grade, skipped the second, and did well through the third and fourth grades. However, beginning somewhere in the fourth and fifth grades of his schooling, Faulkner became a much quieter and more withdrawn child. He began to play hooky occasionally and became somewhat indifferent to his schoolwork, instead taking interest in studying the history of Mississippi on his own time beginning in the seventh grade. The decline of his performance in school continued, and Faulkner wound up repeating the eleventh and twelfth grade, never graduating from high school.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFaulkner spent his boyhood listening to stories told to him by his elders including those of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], slavery, the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and the Falkner family. Faulkner's grandfather would also tell him of the exploits of William's great-grandfather and namesake, [[William Clark Falkner]], who was a successful businessman, writer, and Civil War hero. Telling stories about \"Old Colonel\", as his family called him, had already become something of a family pastime when Faulkner was a boy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to one of Faulkner's biographers, by the time William was born, his great-grandfather had \"been enshrined long since as a household deity.\"<ref name=\"Coughlan, Robert 1953a\">Coughlan, pg. 38</ref>\n\nWhen he was 17, Faulkner met [[Phil Stone]], who became an important early influence on his writing. Stone was four years his senior and came from one of Oxford's older families; he was passionate about literature and had already earned bachelor's degrees from [[Yale University|Yale]] and the [[University of Mississippi]]. Faulkner also attended the latter, joined the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity, and pursued his dream to become a writer. Stone read and was impressed by some of Faulkner's early poetry, becoming one of the first to recognize and encourage Faulkner's talent. Stone mentored the young Faulkner, introducing him to the works of writers such as [[James Joyce]], who influenced Faulkner's own writing. In his early 20s, Faulkner gave poems and short stories he had written to Stone in hopes of their being published. Stone would in turn send these to publishers, but they were uniformly rejected.<ref name=\"Coughlan, Robert 1953\"/>\n[[File:William Faulkner in Toronto, Canada (1918).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cadet Faulkner in [[Toronto]], 1918]]\nThe younger Faulkner was greatly influenced by the history of his family and the region in which he lived.

He did not write his first novel until 1925. His literary influences are deep and wide.

This novel drew heavily on the traditions and history of the South, in which Faulkner had been engrossed in his youth. He was extremely proud of the novel upon its completion and he believed it to be a significant step up from his previous two novels. However, when submitted for publication, it was rejected by the publishers Boni & Liveright. Faulkner was devastated by this rejection, but he eventually allowed his literary agent, Ben Wasson, to significantly edit the text, and the novel was published in 1929 as ''[[Sartoris]].''<ref name=\"Porter, Carolyn 2007\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner 2004\"/> (The original version was issued as ''[[Flags in the Dust]]'' in 1973.)\n\nIn the autumn of 1928, just after his 31st birthday, he began working on ''The Sound and the Fury''. He started by writing three short stories about a group of children with the last name Compson, but soon began to feel that the characters he had created might be better suited for a full-length novel. Perhaps as a result of disappointment in the initial rejection of ''Flags in the Dust'', Faulkner had now become indifferent to his publishers and wrote this novel in a much more experimental style. In describing the writing process for this work, Faulkner would later say, ''\"One day I seemed to shut the door between me and all publisher's addresses and book lists. I said to myself, 'Now I can write.'\"''<ref>Porter, Carolyn.

Estelle brought with her two children from her previous marriage to [[Cornell Franklin]] and Faulkner hoped to support his new family as a writer. Faulkner and Estelle later had a daughter, Jill, in 1933. He began writing ''As I Lay Dying'' in 1929 while working night shifts at the [[University of Mississippi Power House]].

This body of work formed the basis of his reputation and earned him the Nobel Prize at age 52. Faulkner's prodigious output includes his most celebrated novels such as ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929), ''[[As I Lay Dying]]'' (1930), ''[[Light in August]]'' (1932), and ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936). Faulkner was also a prolific writer of [[short story|short stories]].\n\nHis first short story collection, ''[[These 13]]'' (1931), includes many of his most acclaimed (and most frequently [[anthology|anthologized]]) stories, including \"[[A Rose for Emily]]\", \"[[Red Leaves]]\", \"[[That Evening Sun]]\", and \"[[Dry September]]\". Faulkner set many of his short stories and novels in [[Yoknapatawpha County]]<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949/faulkner-bio.html The Nobel Prize in Literature 1949: Biography] ''Nobelprize.org''.</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 based on, and nearly geographically identical to, Lafayette County, of which his hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]], is the county seat. Yoknapatawpha was Faulkner's \"postage stamp\", and the bulk of work that it represents is widely considered by critics to amount to one of the most monumental fictional creations in the history of literature. Three of his novels, ''[[The Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Town (Faulkner novel)|The Town]]'' and ''[[The Mansion (novel)|The Mansion]]'', known collectively as the Snopes Trilogy, document the town of Jefferson and its environs, as an extended family headed by Flem Snopes insinuates itself into the lives and psyches of the general populace.<ref>Charlotte Renner, Talking and Writing in Faulkner's Snopes Trilogy, ACADEMIC JOURNAL ARTICLE, The Southern Literary Journal, Vol. 15, No. 1, Fall 1982.</ref>\n\nHis short story \"[[A Rose for Emily]]\" was his first story published in a major magazine, the ''Forum'', but received little attention from the public. After revisions and reissues, it gained popularity and is now considered one of his best.\n\nFaulkner was known for his experimental style with meticulous attention to [[diction]] and [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]]. In contrast to the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] understatement of his contemporary [[Ernest Hemingway]], Faulkner made frequent use of \"[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]\" in his writing, and wrote often highly emotional, subtle, cerebral, complex, and sometimes [[Southern Gothic|Gothic]] or [[Grotesque#In literature|grotesque]] stories of a wide variety of characters including former slaves or descendants of slaves, poor white, agrarian, or working-class Southerners, and Southern aristocrats.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[The Paris Review]]'' in 1956, Faulkner remarked: <blockquote>Let the writer take up surgery or bricklaying if he is interested in technique. There is no mechanical way to get the writing done, no shortcut. The young writer would be a fool to follow a theory. Teach yourself by your own mistakes; people learn only by error. The good artist believes that nobody is good enough to give him advice. He has supreme vanity. No matter how much he admires the old writer, he wants to beat him.</blockquote> Another esteemed Southern writer, [[Flannery O'Connor]], stated that \"the presence alone of Faulkner in our midst makes a great difference in what the writer can and cannot permit himself to do. Nobody wants his mule and wagon stalled on the same track the Dixie Limited is roaring down\".<ref>Levinger, Larry. \"The Prophet Faulkner.\" ''Atlantic Monthly'' 285 (2000): 76.</ref>\n\nFaulkner wrote two volumes of poetry which were published in small printings, ''The Marble Faun'' (1924),<ref>This book shares a title with ''[[The Marble Faun]]'' (1860), one of the novels of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].</ref> and ''A Green Bough'' (1933), and a collection of mystery stories, ''Knight's Gambit'' (1949).\n\n== Legacy ==\nFaulkner's work has been examined by many critics from a wide variety of critical perspectives.\n\nThe [[New Criticism|New Critics]] became very interested in Faulkner's work, with [[Cleanth Brooks]] writing ''The Yoknapatawpha Country'' and Michael Millgate writing ''The Achievement of William Faulkner''.

The library also houses some of the writer's personal effects and the papers of major Faulkner associates and scholars, such as his biographer Joseph Blotner, bibliographer Linton Massey, and Random House editor Albert Erskine.\n\n[[Southeast Missouri State University]], where the [[Center for Faulkner Studies]] is located, also owns a generous collection of Faulkner materials, including first editions, manuscripts, letters, photographs, artwork, and many materials pertaining to Faulkner's time in Hollywood. The university possesses many personal files and letters kept by Joseph Blotner, along with books and letters that once belonged to Malcolm Cowley, another famous editor for William Faulkner. The university achieved the collection due to a generous donation by Louis Daniel Brodsky, a collector of Faulkner materials, in 1989.\n\nFurther significant Faulkner materials reside at the [[University of Mississippi]], the [[Harry Ransom Center]], and the [[New York Public Library]].\n\nThe Random House records at Columbia University also include letters by and to Faulkner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_4079581|title=Random House records, 1925-1999.|publisher=}}</ref><ref>Jaillant (2014)</ref>\n\n==Audio recordings==\n* Yoknapatawpha Pronunciation by Faulkner<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE_bxElDhrk|title=Faulkner Pronouncing Yoknapatawpha|last=makeveryonehappy|date=February 23, 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n* 'Ole Miss 1949 Nobel Prize acceptance speech and excerpts from ''As I Lay Dying'', ''The Old Man'' and ''A Fable'', plus readings by Debra Winger (\"A Rose for Emily\", \"Barn Burning\"), Keith Carradine (\"Spotted Horses\") and Arliss Howard (\"That Evening Sun\", \"Wash\").
