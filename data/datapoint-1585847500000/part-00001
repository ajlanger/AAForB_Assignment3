All photostreams can be displayed as a justified view, a [[slide show]], a \"detail\" view or a datestamped archive. Clicking on a photostream image opens it in the interactive \"photopage\" alongside data, comments and facilities for embedding images on external sites.\n\nUsers may label their uploaded images with titles and descriptions, and images may be [[tag (metadata)|tagged]], either by the uploader or by other users, if the uploader permits it. These text components enable computer searching of Flickr. Flickr was an early website to implement [[tag cloud]]s, which were used until 2013, providing access to images tagged with the most popular keywords. Tagging was further revised in the photopage redesign of March 2014. Flickr has been cited as a prime example of effective use of [[folksonomy]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Vander Wal|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Vander Wal|title=Folksonomy Research Needs Cleaning Up|date=January 17, 2006|url=http://www.vanderwal.net/random/entrysel.php?blog=1781|access-date=September 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\nUsers can organize their Flickr photos into \"albums\" (formerly \"sets\") which are more flexible than the traditional folder-based method of organizing files, as one photo can belong to one album, many albums, or none at all. Flickr provides code to embed albums into blogs, websites and forums. Flickr albums represent a form of categorical [[metadata]] rather than a physical hierarchy. [[Geotagging]] can be applied to photos in albums,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gossinteractive.com/flickrsets|title=Creating Flickr Sets Video|work=[[Goss Interactive]]|date=February 26, 2010|access-date=February 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503085216/http://www.gossinteractive.com/flickrsets|archivedate=May 3, 2010}}</ref> and any albums with geotagging can be related to a map using imapflickr. The resulting map can be embedded in a website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gossinteractive.com/flickrmap|title=Mapping Flickr Sets Video|work=[[Goss Interactive]]|date=February 26, 2010|access-date=February 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503085211/http://www.gossinteractive.com/flickrmap|archivedate=May 3, 2010}}</ref> Flickr albums may be organized into \"collections\", which can themselves be further organized into higher-order collections.\n\nOrganizr is a [[Web application]] for organizing photos within a Flickr account that can be accessed through the Flickr interface. It allows users to modify tags, descriptions and set groupings, and to place photos on a world map (a feature provided in conjunction with [[Yahoo! Maps]]). It uses [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] to emulate the look, feel and quick functionality of desktop-based photo-management applications, such as Google's [[Picasa]] and [[F-Spot]]. Users can select and apply changes to multiple photos at a time, as an alternative to the standard Flickr interface for editing.\n\n===Access control===\nFlickr provides both private and public image storage. A user uploading an image can set privacy controls that determine who can view the image. A photo can be flagged as either public or private.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/help/privacy/|title=Public/Private|work=Flickr|access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref> Private images are visible by default only to the uploader, but they can also be marked as viewable by friends and/or family. Privacy settings also can be decided by adding photographs from a user's photostream to a \"group pool\". If a group is private all the members of that group can see the photo. If a group is public the photo becomes public as well. Flickr also provides a \"contact list\" which can be used to control image access for a specific set of users in a way similar to that of [[LiveJournal]]. In November 2006, Flickr created a \"guest pass\" system that allows private photos to be shared with non-Flickr members. This setting allows sets or all photos under a certain privacy category (friends or family) to be shared.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/help/guestpass/|title=Guest Pass|work=Flickr|access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref> Many members allow their photos to be viewed by anyone, forming a large collaborative database of categorized photos. By default, other members can leave comments about any image they have permission to view and, in many cases, can add to the list of tags associated with an image.\n\n===Interaction and compatibility===\nThe core functionality of the site relies on standard [[HTML]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] features, allowing for wide compatibility among [[Operating system|platforms]] and [[Web browser|browsers]]; Flickr's functionality includes [[RSS]] and [[Atom (Web standard)|Atom]] feeds and an [[application programming interface|API]] that enables independent programmers to expand its services. This includes a large number of third-party [[Greasemonkey]] scripts that enhance and extend the functionality of Flickr. In 2006, Flickr was the second most extended site on userscripts.org.<ref>{{cite web|last=Partington |first=Brian |url=http://www.utata.org/ink/2006/18583.php| title=Ink Interview: Steeev |work=Utata Daily Ink |date=August 19, 2006 |access-date=July 27, 2013| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831202653/http://www.utata.org/ink/2006/18583.php| archivedate=August 31, 2006}}</ref> Organizr and most of Flickr's other text-editing and tagging interfaces use [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], with which most modern browsers are compliant. Images can be posted to the user's photostream via email attachments, which enables direct uploads from many cameraphones and applications. Flickr uses the [[Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]] on over 3 million [[geotagging|geotagged]] images.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/08/29/flickr-supports-geo-microformat/ |title=Flickr supports \"Geo\" Microformat |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=August 29, 2006 |access-date=July 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the company, {{as of|2009|8|lc=on}} Flickr is hosted on 62 databases across 124 servers, with about 800,000 user accounts per pair of servers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/100485/page6/#reply672723|title=Bad case of Hiccups!|author=Kevin Collins|work=Flickr.com|date=August 16, 2009|access-date=August 18, 2009|quote=For some of the details, we have 62 DBs across 124 servers- accounts are spread across 2 servers each.

Reciprocating this process is optional. A user's homepage contains a stream of their Contacts' photos at 2/3 screensize.<ref name=\"flickrfaq\">{{cite web | url=https://www.flickr.com/help/faq | title=Help | publisher=Flickr | access-date=April 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nGroups are another major means of interaction with fellow members of Flickr around common photography interests. A Flickr Group can be started by any Flickr user, who becomes its administrator and can appoint moderators. Groups may either be open access or invitation-only, and most have an associated pool of photos. The administrator of the Flickr group can monitor and set restrictions for the group, assign awards to members, and may curate and organize the photo content. Recent uploads to a group will sometimes appear on its members' homepages. Group photo pools may be displayed in the \"Justified View\" or as a slideshow.\n\n\"Galleries\" of photos from other photostreams may be curated by any signed-up Flickr user, provided the feature is not disabled by the photo's uploader, these are then publicly viewable.<ref name=\"flickrfaq\" />\n\nAny Flickr user can post comments to a Flickr photo on its photopage, unless this has been disabled by the uploader, and users can \"favorite\" a photo. A user's favorites can be viewed in a justified or slideshow display.<ref name=\"flickrfaq\" />\n\nUsers of [[Windows Photo Gallery]], Apple's [[iPhoto]] (version 8), Adobe's Lightroom 3.2, Apple's [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] (version 3.0), and [[darktable]] have the ability to upload their photos directly to Flickr. They can also automatically update their status on other [[social network|social networking services]] when they upload their images to Flickr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.flickr.net/en/2010/06/10/flickr-facebook/|title=Flickr + Facebook!|work=Flickr|access-date=December 8, 2012}}</ref> Flickr provides a desktop client for [[MacOS|Mac OS X]] and Windows that allows users to upload photos without using the web interface.

Flickr had a partnership with the [[Picnik]] online photo-editing application that included a reduced-feature version of Picnik built into Flickr as a default photo editor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.flickr.net/en/2007/12/05/edit-your-photos-on-flickr/|title=Edit Your Photos!

There are some restrictions on searches for certain types of users: non-members must always use SafeSearch, which omits images noted as potentially offensive, while members whose Yahoo! accounts indicate that they are underage may use SafeSearch or moderate SafeSearch, but cannot turn SafeSearch off completely. The system achieves a fairly good separation of family-friendly photos and adult content; generic image searches normally produce no pornographic results, with the visibility of adult content restricted to users and dedicated Flickr communities who have opted into viewing it.<ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite news|first=Terrence|last=Russell|title=How Porn and Family-Friendly Photos Coexist on Flickr|date=November 7, 2007|work=[[Wired (magazine)#Website|Wired]]|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2007/07/flickr|access-date=July 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFlickr has used this filtering system to change the level of accessibility to \"unsafe\" content for entire nations, including [[South Korea]], Hong Kong and Germany. In summer 2007, German users staged a \"revolt\" over being assigned the user rights of a [[minor (law)|minor]]. See [[#Censorship|Censorship]] below.\n\n===Licensing===\n[[File:Flickr Licenses edit.svg|thumb|250px|Breakdown of [[Creative Commons]] license use on Flickr as of 2009<ref>[https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13588 Analysis of 100M CC-Licensed Images on Flickr] Michelle Thorne, creativecommons.org, March 25, 2009</ref>]]\nFlickr offers users the ability to either release their images under certain common usage [[license]]s or label them as \"[[all rights reserved]]\". The licensing options primarily include the [[Creative Commons]] 2.0 attribution-based and minor content-control licenses \u2013 although jurisdiction and version-specific licenses cannot be selected. As with \"[[tag (metadata)|tags]]\", the site allows easy searching of only those images that fall under a specific license.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flickr: Help: Photos: How can I copyright my photos?|work=Flickr|url=https://www.flickr.com/help/photos/#87|access-date=November 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\nSeveral museums and archives post images released under a \"no known restrictions\" license, which was first made available on January 16, 2008. According to Flickr, the goal of the license is to \"firstly show you hidden treasures in the world's public photography archives, and secondly to show how your input and knowledge can help make these collections even richer.\" Participants include the [[National Museum of Denmark]], [[Powerhouse Museum]], [[George Eastman Museum]], [[Library of Congress]], [[Nationaal Archief]], [[National Archives and Records Administration]], [[National Library of Scotland]], [[State Library of New South Wales]], and [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/commons/institutions/|title=The Commons: Participating Institutions|access-date=November 28, 2013|work=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Noam|last=Cohen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/technology/internet/19link.html?_r=1&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|title=Historical Photos in Web Archives Gain Vivid New Lives|quote=In a similar move to harness the public's knowledge about old photographs, the Library of Congress a year ago began adding photographs with no known restrictions to a Flickr service called the Commons.

The photos were initially posted with a [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons Attribution]] license requiring that the original photographers be credited. Flickr later created a new license which identified them as \"United States Government Work\", which does not carry any copyright restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Singel |first=Ryan |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/05/flickr-creates-new-license-for-white-house-photos/ |title=Flickr Creates New License for White House Photos |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)#Website|Wired]] |date=May 11, 2009 |access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, Flickr added the [[Public Domain Mark|Creative Commons Public Domain Mark]] and [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|Creative Commons Zero]] (CC0) to its licensing options.<ref>[http://blog.flickr.net/en/2015/03/30/flickr-now-offers-public-domain-and-cc0-designations/ Flickr now offers Public Domain and CC0 designations]</ref> The Public Domain Mark is meant for images that are no longer protected by copyright. CC0 is used for works that are still protected by copyright or neighbouring rights, but where the rightsholders choose to waive all those rights.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Censorship===\nOn June 12, 2007, in the wake of the rollout of localized language versions of the site, Flickr implemented a user-side rating system for filtering out potentially controversial photos. Simultaneously, users with accounts registered with Yahoo! subsidiaries in Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea were prevented from viewing photos rated \"moderate\" or \"restricted\" on the three-part scale used. Many Flickr users, particularly in Germany, protested against the new restrictions, claiming unwanted censorship from Flickr and Yahoo.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/91160| work=[[C't]]| title=Flickr Filter Raises Eyebrows| last=Morris| first=Craig| date=June 14, 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630132833/http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/91160| archivedate=June 30, 2007| access-date=July 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFlickr management, unwilling to go into legal details, implied that the reason for the stringent filtering was some unusually strict age-verification laws in Germany.

Although its use of the photos in this manner is legal and allowed under the licenses, Flickr was criticized by users for what they perceived to be unfair exploitation of artists' works, as all the profits from these offerings go to Yahoo! and are not shared with their respective photographers, and users were not given a means of opting-out from the program without placing their photos under a more restrictive non-commercial license. By contrast, a similar opt-in program for \"licensed\" photos does give photographers a 51% share of sales.

All photostreams can be displayed as a justified view, a [[slide show]], a \"detail\" view or a datestamped archive. Clicking on a photostream image opens it in the interactive \"photopage\" alongside data, comments and facilities for embedding images on external sites.\n\nUsers may label their uploaded images with titles and descriptions, and images may be [[tag (metadata)|tagged]], either by the uploader or by other users, if the uploader permits it. These text components enable computer searching of Flickr. Flickr was an early website to implement [[tag cloud]]s, which were used until 2013, providing access to images tagged with the most popular keywords. Tagging was further revised in the photopage redesign of March 2014. Flickr has been cited as a prime example of effective use of [[folksonomy]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Vander Wal|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Vander Wal|title=Folksonomy Research Needs Cleaning Up|date=January 17, 2006|url=http://www.vanderwal.net/random/entrysel.php?blog=1781|access-date=September 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\nUsers can organize their Flickr photos into \"albums\" (formerly \"sets\") which are more flexible than the traditional folder-based method of organizing files, as one photo can belong to one album, many albums, or none at all. Flickr provides code to embed albums into blogs, websites and forums. Flickr albums represent a form of categorical [[metadata]] rather than a physical hierarchy. [[Geotagging]] can be applied to photos in albums,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gossinteractive.com/flickrsets|title=Creating Flickr Sets Video|work=[[Goss Interactive]]|date=February 26, 2010|access-date=February 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503085216/http://www.gossinteractive.com/flickrsets|archivedate=May 3, 2010}}</ref> and any albums with geotagging can be related to a map using imapflickr. The resulting map can be embedded in a website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gossinteractive.com/flickrmap|title=Mapping Flickr Sets Video|work=[[Goss Interactive]]|date=February 26, 2010|access-date=February 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503085211/http://www.gossinteractive.com/flickrmap|archivedate=May 3, 2010}}</ref> Flickr albums may be organized into \"collections\", which can themselves be further organized into higher-order collections.\n\nOrganizr is a [[Web application]] for organizing photos within a Flickr account that can be accessed through the Flickr interface. It allows users to modify tags, descriptions and set groupings, and to place photos on a world map (a feature provided in conjunction with [[Yahoo! Maps]]). It uses [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] to emulate the look, feel and quick functionality of desktop-based photo-management applications, such as Google's [[Picasa]] and [[F-Spot]]. Users can select and apply changes to multiple photos at a time, as an alternative to the standard Flickr interface for editing.\n\n===Access control===\nFlickr provides both private and public image storage. A user uploading an image can set privacy controls that determine who can view the image. A photo can be flagged as either public or private.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/help/privacy/|title=Public/Private|work=Flickr|access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref> Private images are visible by default only to the uploader, but they can also be marked as viewable by friends and/or family. Privacy settings also can be decided by adding photographs from a user's photostream to a \"group pool\". If a group is private all the members of that group can see the photo. If a group is public the photo becomes public as well. Flickr also provides a \"contact list\" which can be used to control image access for a specific set of users in a way similar to that of [[LiveJournal]]. In November 2006, Flickr created a \"guest pass\" system that allows private photos to be shared with non-Flickr members. This setting allows sets or all photos under a certain privacy category (friends or family) to be shared.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/help/guestpass/|title=Guest Pass|work=Flickr|access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref> Many members allow their photos to be viewed by anyone, forming a large collaborative database of categorized photos. By default, other members can leave comments about any image they have permission to view and, in many cases, can add to the list of tags associated with an image.\n\n===Interaction and compatibility===\nThe core functionality of the site relies on standard [[HTML]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] features, allowing for wide compatibility among [[Operating system|platforms]] and [[Web browser|browsers]]; Flickr's functionality includes [[RSS]] and [[Atom (Web standard)|Atom]] feeds and an [[application programming interface|API]] that enables independent programmers to expand its services. This includes a large number of third-party [[Greasemonkey]] scripts that enhance and extend the functionality of Flickr. In 2006, Flickr was the second most extended site on userscripts.org.<ref>{{cite web|last=Partington |first=Brian |url=http://www.utata.org/ink/2006/18583.php| title=Ink Interview: Steeev |work=Utata Daily Ink |date=August 19, 2006 |access-date=July 27, 2013| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831202653/http://www.utata.org/ink/2006/18583.php| archivedate=August 31, 2006}}</ref> Organizr and most of Flickr's other text-editing and tagging interfaces use [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], with which most modern browsers are compliant. Images can be posted to the user's photostream via email attachments, which enables direct uploads from many cameraphones and applications. Flickr uses the [[Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]] on over 3 million [[geotagging|geotagged]] images.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/08/29/flickr-supports-geo-microformat/ |title=Flickr supports \"Geo\" Microformat |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=August 29, 2006 |access-date=July 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the company, {{as of|2009|8|lc=on}} Flickr is hosted on 62 databases across 124 servers, with about 800,000 user accounts per pair of servers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/100485/page6/#reply672723|title=Bad case of Hiccups!|author=Kevin Collins|work=Flickr.com|date=August 16, 2009|access-date=August 18, 2009|quote=For some of the details, we have 62 DBs across 124 servers- accounts are spread across 2 servers each.

Reciprocating this process is optional. A user's homepage contains a stream of their Contacts' photos at 2/3 screensize.<ref name=\"flickrfaq\">{{cite web | url=https://www.flickr.com/help/faq | title=Help | publisher=Flickr | access-date=April 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nGroups are another major means of interaction with fellow members of Flickr around common photography interests. A Flickr Group can be started by any Flickr user, who becomes its administrator and can appoint moderators. Groups may either be open access or invitation-only, and most have an associated pool of photos. The administrator of the Flickr group can monitor and set restrictions for the group, assign awards to members, and may curate and organize the photo content. Recent uploads to a group will sometimes appear on its members' homepages. Group photo pools may be displayed in the \"Justified View\" or as a slideshow.\n\n\"Galleries\" of photos from other photostreams may be curated by any signed-up Flickr user, provided the feature is not disabled by the photo's uploader, these are then publicly viewable.<ref name=\"flickrfaq\" />\n\nAny Flickr user can post comments to a Flickr photo on its photopage, unless this has been disabled by the uploader, and users can \"favorite\" a photo. A user's favorites can be viewed in a justified or slideshow display.<ref name=\"flickrfaq\" />\n\nUsers of [[Windows Photo Gallery]], Apple's [[iPhoto]] (version 8), Adobe's Lightroom 3.2, Apple's [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] (version 3.0), and [[darktable]] have the ability to upload their photos directly to Flickr. They can also automatically update their status on other [[social network|social networking services]] when they upload their images to Flickr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.flickr.net/en/2010/06/10/flickr-facebook/|title=Flickr + Facebook!|work=Flickr|access-date=December 8, 2012}}</ref> Flickr provides a desktop client for [[MacOS|Mac OS X]] and Windows that allows users to upload photos without using the web interface.

Flickr had a partnership with the [[Picnik]] online photo-editing application that included a reduced-feature version of Picnik built into Flickr as a default photo editor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.flickr.net/en/2007/12/05/edit-your-photos-on-flickr/|title=Edit Your Photos!

There are some restrictions on searches for certain types of users: non-members must always use SafeSearch, which omits images noted as potentially offensive, while members whose Yahoo! accounts indicate that they are underage may use SafeSearch or moderate SafeSearch, but cannot turn SafeSearch off completely. The system achieves a fairly good separation of family-friendly photos and adult content; generic image searches normally produce no pornographic results, with the visibility of adult content restricted to users and dedicated Flickr communities who have opted into viewing it.<ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite news|first=Terrence|last=Russell|title=How Porn and Family-Friendly Photos Coexist on Flickr|date=November 7, 2007|work=[[Wired (magazine)#Website|Wired]]|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2007/07/flickr|access-date=July 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFlickr has used this filtering system to change the level of accessibility to \"unsafe\" content for entire nations, including [[South Korea]], Hong Kong and Germany. In summer 2007, German users staged a \"revolt\" over being assigned the user rights of a [[minor (law)|minor]]. See [[#Censorship|Censorship]] below.\n\n===Licensing===\n[[File:Flickr Licenses edit.svg|thumb|250px|Breakdown of [[Creative Commons]] license use on Flickr as of 2009<ref>[https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13588 Analysis of 100M CC-Licensed Images on Flickr] Michelle Thorne, creativecommons.org, March 25, 2009</ref>]]\nFlickr offers users the ability to either release their images under certain common usage [[license]]s or label them as \"[[all rights reserved]]\". The licensing options primarily include the [[Creative Commons]] 2.0 attribution-based and minor content-control licenses \u2013 although jurisdiction and version-specific licenses cannot be selected. As with \"[[tag (metadata)|tags]]\", the site allows easy searching of only those images that fall under a specific license.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flickr: Help: Photos: How can I copyright my photos?|work=Flickr|url=https://www.flickr.com/help/photos/#87|access-date=November 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\nSeveral museums and archives post images released under a \"no known restrictions\" license, which was first made available on January 16, 2008. According to Flickr, the goal of the license is to \"firstly show you hidden treasures in the world's public photography archives, and secondly to show how your input and knowledge can help make these collections even richer.\" Participants include the [[National Museum of Denmark]], [[Powerhouse Museum]], [[George Eastman Museum]], [[Library of Congress]], [[Nationaal Archief]], [[National Archives and Records Administration]], [[National Library of Scotland]], [[State Library of New South Wales]], and [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/commons/institutions/|title=The Commons: Participating Institutions|access-date=November 28, 2013|work=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Noam|last=Cohen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/technology/internet/19link.html?_r=1&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|title=Historical Photos in Web Archives Gain Vivid New Lives|quote=In a similar move to harness the public's knowledge about old photographs, the Library of Congress a year ago began adding photographs with no known restrictions to a Flickr service called the Commons.

The photos were initially posted with a [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons Attribution]] license requiring that the original photographers be credited. Flickr later created a new license which identified them as \"United States Government Work\", which does not carry any copyright restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Singel |first=Ryan |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/05/flickr-creates-new-license-for-white-house-photos/ |title=Flickr Creates New License for White House Photos |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)#Website|Wired]] |date=May 11, 2009 |access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, Flickr added the [[Public Domain Mark|Creative Commons Public Domain Mark]] and [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|Creative Commons Zero]] (CC0) to its licensing options.<ref>[http://blog.flickr.net/en/2015/03/30/flickr-now-offers-public-domain-and-cc0-designations/ Flickr now offers Public Domain and CC0 designations]</ref> The Public Domain Mark is meant for images that are no longer protected by copyright. CC0 is used for works that are still protected by copyright or neighbouring rights, but where the rightsholders choose to waive all those rights.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Censorship===\nOn June 12, 2007, in the wake of the rollout of localized language versions of the site, Flickr implemented a user-side rating system for filtering out potentially controversial photos. Simultaneously, users with accounts registered with Yahoo! subsidiaries in Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea were prevented from viewing photos rated \"moderate\" or \"restricted\" on the three-part scale used. Many Flickr users, particularly in Germany, protested against the new restrictions, claiming unwanted censorship from Flickr and Yahoo.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/91160| work=[[C't]]| title=Flickr Filter Raises Eyebrows| last=Morris| first=Craig| date=June 14, 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630132833/http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/91160| archivedate=June 30, 2007| access-date=July 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFlickr management, unwilling to go into legal details, implied that the reason for the stringent filtering was some unusually strict age-verification laws in Germany.

Although its use of the photos in this manner is legal and allowed under the licenses, Flickr was criticized by users for what they perceived to be unfair exploitation of artists' works, as all the profits from these offerings go to Yahoo! and are not shared with their respective photographers, and users were not given a means of opting-out from the program without placing their photos under a more restrictive non-commercial license. By contrast, a similar opt-in program for \"licensed\" photos does give photographers a 51% share of sales. On December 19, 2014, Bernardo Hernandez announced that Flickr would pull all Creative Commons-licensed content from the program and issue refunds, stating that \"Subsequently, we'll work closely with Creative Commons to come back with programs that align better with our community values.\"<ref name=\"guardian-flickrccsale\">{{cite news|title=Flickr scraps plan to sell users' photos as wall art after licensing row|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/19/flickr-creative-commons-wall-art-licensing-row|access-date=December 22, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=December 19, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian-flak\">{{cite news|title=Flickr takes flak for selling Creative Commons photos as wall-art prints|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/02/flickr-creative-commons-photos-wall-art|access-date=December 22, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=December 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://blog.flickr.net/en/2014/12/18/an-update-on-flickr-wall-art|title = An Update on Flickr Wall Art|date = December 18, 2014|access-date = April 8, 2015|website = blog.flickr.net/|publisher = |last = |first =}}</ref>\n\n===Deletion of files of non-paying users===\nOn November 1, 2018, Flickr announced new restrictions for its users.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181101005328/en/Flickr-Announces-New-Photographer-Centric-Improvements-Flickr-Pro|title=Flickr Announces New Photographer-Centric Improvements to Flickr Pro, Free Plans|work=BusinessWire|date=November 1, 2018|accessdate=February 23, 2019}}</ref>\n*On January 8, 2019, non-paying users are only able to upload up to 1000 files free of charge.\n*On March 12, 2019, deletion of the oldest files, determined by the upload date, has begun until the limit of 1000 files is met.
