The plane is forced to land at [[Wichita, Kansas]] and the President is flown to his original destination on a back-up plane. Trapp visited Air Force One only because [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] Major Timothy Kerry was sick with the flu. NCIS arrive to investigate the death, but meet some jurisdictional problems with both the [[FBI]] and [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] who each want to take the lead. With Secret Service agent [[Caitlin Todd]] grudgingly agreeing to help, NCIS Special Agents [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs]] and [[Anthony DiNozzo|Tony DiNozzo]], and NCIS Medical Examiner [[List of NCIS characters#Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard|Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard]] examine the body. The local coroner, a friend of Ducky's, manages to stall the FBI long enough for NCIS to begin preliminary investigations. On Gibbs' orders, Tony shuts the door with the FBI agents still outside and has the pilot immediately fly the plane back to Washington after receiving authorization from Agent Todd.\n\nBack at the NCIS headquarters, Ducky is autopsying the body of Commander Trapp, only to find he suffered a cerebral embolism, which is considered a natural cause of death. Gibbs wants the team to keep looking while he joins Agent Todd aboard Air Force One. Later, another senior officer revealed to be Marine [[Major (United States)|Major]] Timothy Kerry, is found dead in his car in [[Georgetown, Virginia|Georgetown]] with similar symptoms to those of Commander Trapp. NCIS Forensic Specialist [[Abby Sciuto]] is able to find [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] and snake venom from an Australian [[Coastal taipan|Taipan]] on both Commander Trapp and Major Kerry's uniforms, which could explain why they died. DiNozzo investigates both of them, finding out that Trapp and Kerry used the same [[dry cleaning|dry cleaner]].\n\nAboard Air Force One, Agent Todd tells Gibbs about her relationship with Major Kerry, resulting in an interrogation concerning her motive for his death. Todd's reaction makes Gibbs believe that she is innocent. Todd explains the differences between the backup plane and the main plane. Gibbs focuses on the [[Armory (military)|armory]], which has locks instead of digital keypads. If terrorists are planning an attack, they must have copied the keys.\n\nAware about the threat, Gibbs checks the armory while Todd protects the President. The armory is open, and a journalist is trying to get to the President's quarters in an attempt to kill him. Gibbs confronts the journalist, who attacks, but is killed before any damage is done.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Agent Todd resigns from the Secret Service for breaking [[fraternization]] rules.
