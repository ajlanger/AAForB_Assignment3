Each of them is an independent art-object and may become a temporary private living space. The idea of U-spaces was conceived by Erarta. The projects themselves were created by the artists whose name are indicated together with the information on each of the halls. Every such space should evoke a set of associations in the visitor's mind and make him / her experience deeply private emotions. According to the artists\u2019 conception, at first, these emotions might be closely related to name of the hall; further on, however, their development will depend on the visitor\u2019s wish. Tickets to these halls have a time limit.\n\n== Cinema halls ==\nOne of the cinema halls is equipped with another Erarta innovation \u2013 [[art-animation]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.erarta.com/en/museum/projects/detail/8aa774ed-061b-11e2-beae-8920284aa333/ | title=Art-Animation | publisher=[http://www.erarta.com/ Erarta]}}</ref> These are short-length animated movies developed especially for Erarta that somehow continue certain paintings from the museum collection.\n\nOften art-animation makes visitors develop a different understanding of a painting by either developing its idea in an unexpected way or anticipating it. \nDVDs with art-animations are available in the gift shop on the first floor. \nIn the second cinema-hall author\u2019s video-art is displayed.\nBoth cinema-halls are open to visitors in the museum working hours. No extra fee is charged.\n\n== Galleries ==\nIn Erarta, galleries located in the northern wing of the building display original works by artists who may not be represented in Erarta museum, which are for sale. The gallery on the first floor houses monthly personal exhibitions or artistic projects. Other Erarta galleries offer exhibitions by numerous artists. the exposition is regularly renewed and the cast of artists represented there is changed.\n\n== Printed editions ==\nErarta publishes a series of \"Erarta\" catalogues where art literature has prevailing importance. These texts are not done in the form of an article by an art critic. Rather, these are essays where the author expresses his/her personal associations evoked by a certain piece of art. On the Erarta website regular contests are held for the most interesting texts to accompany works from the collection.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.erarta.com/en/museum/projects/detail/5a45ad6e-061d-11e2-beae-8920284aa333/ | title=Art-literature | publisher=[http://www.erarta.com/ Erarta]}}</ref>\n\nErarta publishes a magazine called \"''Non-StadArt''\". This edition is targeted at a wide audience including those who have no background in art perception but are inclined to discussions. Half of each issue is devoted to a vivid story about one of the artists represented in the museum collection and contains publications of his both famous and unknown works that do not necessarily belong to the field of painting.\n\nCatalogues and magazines are available in the reference library next to the art shop in the lobby on the first floor. \nThey are also available for sale in the gift shop or on the website.\n\n== The workshop and art shop ==\nIn the art shop on the first floor visitors may buy products of Erarta workshop: e.g., ready-made prints (copies of paintings on paper or canvas) and giclees (copies of paintings with final hand-made improvements), as well as order copies of any painting of the museum or electronic collection.

Examples of wall art can be seen in the lobby on the first floor, the caf\u00e9 gallery on the third floor, as well as in enclosed offices.\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe gift shop is on the first floor.
