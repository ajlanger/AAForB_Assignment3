It belongs to the [[halide mineral]]s. It crystallizes in [[cubic crystal system|isometric]] [[crystal habit|cubic habit]], although octahedral and more complex isometric forms are not uncommon.\n\nThe [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], based on [[Scratch hardness|scratch]] [[hardness comparison]], defines value 4 as Fluorite.\n\nPure fluorite is transparent, both in visible and ultraviolet light, but impurities usually make it a colorful mineral and the stone has ornamental and [[lapidary]] uses. Industrially, fluorite is used as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] for smelting, and in the production of certain glasses and enamels. The purest grades of fluorite are a source of fluoride for [[hydrofluoric acid]] manufacture, which is the intermediate source of most fluorine-containing [[fine chemical]]s. Optically clear transparent fluorite lenses have low [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], so lenses made from it exhibit less [[chromatic aberration]], making them valuable in microscopes and telescopes. Fluorite optics are also usable in the far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared ranges, where conventional glasses are too absorbent for use.\n\n==History and etymology==\n\nThe word ''fluorite'' is derived from the [[Latin]] verb ''fluere'', meaning ''to flow''. The mineral is used as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in iron [[smelting]] to decrease the [[viscosity]] of slags. The term ''flux'' comes from the Latin adjective ''fluxus'', meaning ''flowing, loose, slack''. The mineral fluorite was originally termed '''fluorospar''' and was first discussed in print in a 1530 work ''Bermannvs sive de re metallica dialogus'' [Bermannus; or a dialogue about the nature of metals], by [[Georgius Agricola]], as a mineral noted for its usefulness as a flux.<ref name=\"awe\">{{cite web|title=Discovery of fluorine|publisher=Fluoride History |url=http://www.fluoride-history.de/fluorine.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"assassinated\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fl4sdCYrq3cC&pg=PT158|isbn=978-0-444-52239-9|page=149|author=compiled by Alexander Senning.|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|title=Elsevier's dictionary of chemoetymology: the whies and whences of chemical nomenclature and terminology}}</ref> Agricola, a German scientist with expertise in [[philology]], [[mining]], and metallurgy, named fluorspar as a [[New Latin language|neo-Latin]]ization of the [[German language|German]] ''Flussspat'' from ''Flu\u00df'' ([[stream]], [[river]]) and ''Spat'' (meaning a [[nonmetal]]lic mineral akin to [[gypsum]], sp\u00e6rst\u0101n, ''[[spar (mineralogy)|spear stone]]'', referring to its crystalline projections).<ref>{{OEtymD|fluorite}}</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|spar}}</ref>\n\nIn 1852, fluorite gave its name to the phenomenon of [[fluorescence]], which is prominent in fluorites from certain locations, due to certain impurities in the crystal. Fluorite also gave the name to its constitutive element [[fluorine]].<ref name=Mindat>[http://www.mindat.org/min-1576.html Fluorite]. Mindat.org</ref> Currently, the word \"fluorspar\" is most commonly used for fluorite as the industrial and chemical commodity, while \"fluorite\" is used mineralogically and in most other senses.\n\nIn the context of archeology, gemmology, classical studies, and egyptology, the Latin terms ''murrina'' and ''myrrhina'' refer to fluorite.<ref>James Harrell 2012. UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, Gemstones.</ref> In book 37 of his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'', [[Pliny the Elder]] describes it as a precious stone with purple and white mottling, whose objects carved from it, the Romans prize.\n\n==Structure==\n{{Main|Calcium fluoride}}\n[[File:Fluorite Structure.jpg|thumb|132px|left|The structure of calcium fluoride CaF<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>]]\nFluorite crystallizes in a cubic motif. [[Crystal twinning]] is common and adds complexity to the observed [[crystal]] habits. Fluorite has four perfect cleavage planes that help produce octahedral fragments.  The structural motif adopted by fluorite is so common that the motif is called the [[fluorite structure]]. Element substitution for the [[calcium]] [[cation]] often includes certain [[rare earth element]]s (REE), such as yttrium and cerium. Iron, sodium, and barium are also common impurities. Some fluoride anions may be replaced by the [[chloride]] [[anion]].\n\n==Occurrence and mining==\n[[File:Closeup of Fluorite.jpg|thumb|left|A closeup of fluorite surface|alt=black, chevronned (wavy, jagged) structure]]\nFluorite is a widely occurring mineral with significant deposits in over 9,000 areas globally.<ref name=Mindat/> It may occur as a [[Vein (geology)|vein deposit]], especially with metallic minerals, where it often forms a part of the [[gangue]] (the surrounding \"host-rock\" in which valuable minerals occur) and may be associated with [[galena]], [[sphalerite]], [[barite]], [[quartz]], and [[calcite]]. It is a common mineral in deposits of [[hydrothermal]] origin and has been noted as a primary mineral in [[granite]]s and other [[igneous rock]]s and as a common minor constituent of [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] and [[limestone]].\n\nThe world reserves of fluorite are estimated at 230 million [[tonne]]s (Mt) with the largest deposits being in [[South Africa]] (about 41 Mt), Mexico (32 Mt) and China (24 Mt). China is leading the world production with about 3 Mt annually (in 2010), followed by Mexico (1.0 Mt), [[Mongolia]] (0.45 Mt), [[Russia]] (0.22 Mt), South Africa (0.13 Mt), Spain (0.12 Mt) and Namibia (0.11 Mt).<ref>[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/fluorspar/mcs-2011-fluor.pdf Fluorspar]. USGS.gov (2011)</ref>\n\nOne of the largest deposits of fluorspar in North America is located in the [[Burin Peninsula]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], Canada. The first official recognition of fluorspar in the area was recorded by geologist J.B. Jukes in 1843. He noted an occurrence of \"galena\" or lead ore and fluoride of lime on the west side of St. Lawrence harbour. It is recorded that interest in the commercial mining of fluorspar began in 1928 with the first ore being extracted in 1933. Eventually at Iron Springs Mine, the shafts reached depths of {{convert|970|ft|m}}. In the St. Lawrence area, the veins are persistent for great lengths and several of them have wide lenses.

Fluorescence involves the elevation of electron energy levels by quanta of ultraviolet light, followed by the progressive falling back of the electrons into their previous energy state, releasing quanta of visible light in the process. In fluorite, the visible light emitted is most commonly blue, but red, purple, yellow, green and white also occur. The fluorescence of fluorite may be due to mineral impurities, such as [[yttrium]] and [[ytterbium]], or organic matter, such as volatile [[hydrocarbons]] in the crystal lattice. In particular, the blue fluorescence seen in fluorites from certain parts of [[Great Britain]] responsible for the naming of the phenomenon of fluorescence itself, has been attributed to the presence of inclusions of divalent [[europium]] in the crystal.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Przibram|first1=K.|title=Fluorescence of Fluorite and the Bivalent Europium Ion|journal=Nature|volume=135|page=100|year=1935|doi=10.1038/135100a0|issue=3403|bibcode=1935Natur.135..100P}}</ref>\n\nOne fluorescent variety of fluorite is [[chlorophane]], which is reddish or purple in color and fluoresces brightly in emerald green when heated ([[thermoluminescence]]), or when illuminated with ultraviolet light.\n\nThe color of visible light emitted when a sample of fluorite is fluorescing depends on where the original specimen was collected; different impurities having been included in the crystal lattice in different places. Neither does all fluorite fluoresce equally brightly, even from the same locality. Therefore, ultraviolet light is not a reliable tool for the identification of specimens, nor for quantifying the mineral in mixtures. For example, among British fluorites, those from [[Northumberland]], [[County Durham]], and eastern [[Cumbria]] are the most consistently fluorescent, whereas fluorite from [[Yorkshire]], [[Derbyshire]], and [[Cornwall]], if they fluoresce at all, are generally only feebly fluorescent.\n\nFluorite also exhibits the property of [[thermoluminescence]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pNoV48kNSsC&pg=PA9|page=9|title=Thermoluminescence of Solids|author=McKeever, S.

Less common are pink, red, white, brown, and black. Color zoning or banding is commonly present. The color of the fluorite is determined by factors including impurities, exposure to radiation, and the absence or voids of the [[F-center|color centers]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"133px\" heights=\"130px\">\nFile:Fluorite-Galena-flu70a.jpg|Pastel green fluorite crystal on galena\nFile:Fluorite-132158.jpg|A golden yellow with hints of purple fluorite\nFile:Fluorite-cflo06x.jpg|Freestanding purple fluorite cluster between two quartzes\nFile:Fluorite-189396.jpg|Light to dark burgundy color fluorite\nFile:Fluorite-158842.jpg|Transparent teal color fluorite with purple highlights\nFile:Fluorite-233168.jpg|Grass-green fluorite octahedrons clustered on a quartz-rich matrix\n</gallery>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Source of fluorine and fluoride===\nFluorite is a major source of [[hydrogen fluoride]], a commodity chemical used to produce a wide range of materials.

Metallurgical grade fluorite (60\u201385% CaF<sub>2</sub>), the lowest of the three grades, has traditionally been used as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] to lower the melting point of raw materials in [[steel]] production to aid the removal of impurities, and later in the production of [[aluminium]]. Ceramic grade fluorite (85\u201395% CaF<sub>2</sub>) is used in the manufacture of [[opalescence|opalescent]] [[glass]], [[vitreous enamel|enamels]], and cooking utensils. The highest grade, \"acid grade fluorite\" (97% or more CaF<sub>2</sub>), accounts for about 95% of fluorite consumption in the US where it is used to make [[hydrogen fluoride]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]] by reacting the fluorite with [[sulfuric acid]].<ref name=usgs/>\n\nInternationally, acid-grade fluorite is also used in the production of AlF<sub>3</sub> and [[cryolite]] (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>), which are the main fluorine compounds used in aluminium smelting. [[Alumina]] is dissolved in a bath that consists primarily of molten Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>, AlF<sub>3</sub>, and fluorite (CaF<sub>2</sub>) to allow electrolytic recovery of aluminium.

Fluorite may be drilled into beads and used in jewelry, although due to its relative softness it is not widely used as a semiprecious stone. It is also used for ornamental carvings, with expert carvings taking advantage of the stone's zonation.\n\n====Optics====\n{{See also|Fluoride glass}}\nIn the laboratory, calcium fluoride is commonly used as a window material for both [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths, since it is transparent in these regions (about 0.15&nbsp;\u00b5m to 9&nbsp;\u00b5m) and exhibits extremely low change in [[refractive index]] with wavelength. Furthermore, the material is attacked by few reagents. At wavelengths as short as 157&nbsp;nm, a common wavelength used for [[semiconductor]] stepper manufacture for [[integrated circuit]] [[photolithography|lithography]], the refractive index of calcium fluoride shows some non-linearity at high power densities, which has inhibited its use for this purpose. In the early years of the 21st century, the stepper market for calcium fluoride collapsed, and many large manufacturing facilities have been closed. [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] and other manufacturers have used synthetically grown crystals of calcium fluoride components in lenses to aid apochromatic design, and to reduce [[dispersion (optics)|light dispersion]]. This use has largely been superseded by newer glasses and computer-aided design. As an infrared optical material, calcium fluoride is widely available and was sometimes known by the [[Eastman Kodak]] trademarked name \"Irtran-3\", although this designation is obsolete.\n\nFluorite glass is a type of [[low-dispersion glass]]. [[List of lens designs|Optical groups]] made with low dispersion glass have a very low [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (color spreading), so optical groups made with fluorite elements exhibit less [[chromatic aberration]] than those utilising a traditional [[flint glass]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqTkCF6Ra9kC&pg=PA339|page=339|title=Bulk crystal growth of electronic, optical & optoelectronic materials|author=Capper, Peter |publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year= 2005|isbn=0-470-85142-2}}</ref> Optical groups employ a [[Achromatic lens|combination]] of different types of glass.

It belongs to the [[halide mineral]]s. It crystallizes in [[cubic crystal system|isometric]] [[crystal habit|cubic habit]], although octahedral and more complex isometric forms are not uncommon.\n\nThe [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], based on [[Scratch hardness|scratch]] [[hardness comparison]], defines value 4 as Fluorite.\n\nPure fluorite is transparent, both in visible and ultraviolet light, but impurities usually make it a colorful mineral and the stone has ornamental and [[lapidary]] uses. Industrially, fluorite is used as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] for smelting, and in the production of certain glasses and enamels. The purest grades of fluorite are a source of fluoride for [[hydrofluoric acid]] manufacture, which is the intermediate source of most fluorine-containing [[fine chemical]]s. Optically clear transparent fluorite lenses have low [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], so lenses made from it exhibit less [[chromatic aberration]], making them valuable in microscopes and telescopes. Fluorite optics are also usable in the far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared ranges, where conventional glasses are too absorbent for use.\n\n==History and etymology==\n\nThe word ''fluorite'' is derived from the [[Latin]] verb ''fluere'', meaning ''to flow''. The mineral is used as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in iron [[smelting]] to decrease the [[viscosity]] of slags. The term ''flux'' comes from the Latin adjective ''fluxus'', meaning ''flowing, loose, slack''. The mineral fluorite was originally termed '''fluorospar''' and was first discussed in print in a 1530 work ''Bermannvs sive de re metallica dialogus'' [Bermannus; or a dialogue about the nature of metals], by [[Georgius Agricola]], as a mineral noted for its usefulness as a flux.<ref name=\"awe\">{{cite web|title=Discovery of fluorine|publisher=Fluoride History |url=http://www.fluoride-history.de/fluorine.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"assassinated\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fl4sdCYrq3cC&pg=PT158|isbn=978-0-444-52239-9|page=149|author=compiled by Alexander Senning.|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|title=Elsevier's dictionary of chemoetymology: the whies and whences of chemical nomenclature and terminology}}</ref> Agricola, a German scientist with expertise in [[philology]], [[mining]], and metallurgy, named fluorspar as a [[New Latin language|neo-Latin]]ization of the [[German language|German]] ''Flussspat'' from ''Flu\u00df'' ([[stream]], [[river]]) and ''Spat'' (meaning a [[nonmetal]]lic mineral akin to [[gypsum]], sp\u00e6rst\u0101n, ''[[spar (mineralogy)|spear stone]]'', referring to its crystalline projections).<ref>{{OEtymD|fluorite}}</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|spar}}</ref>\n\nIn 1852, fluorite gave its name to the phenomenon of [[fluorescence]], which is prominent in fluorites from certain locations, due to certain impurities in the crystal. Fluorite also gave the name to its constitutive element [[fluorine]].<ref name=Mindat>[http://www.mindat.org/min-1576.html Fluorite]. Mindat.org</ref> Currently, the word \"fluorspar\" is most commonly used for fluorite as the industrial and chemical commodity, while \"fluorite\" is used mineralogically and in most other senses.\n\nIn the context of archeology, gemmology, classical studies, and egyptology, the Latin terms ''murrina'' and ''myrrhina'' refer to fluorite.<ref>James Harrell 2012. UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, Gemstones.</ref> In book 37 of his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'', [[Pliny the Elder]] describes it as a precious stone with purple and white mottling, whose objects carved from it, the Romans prize.\n\n==Structure==\n{{Main|Calcium fluoride}}\n[[File:Fluorite Structure.jpg|thumb|132px|left|The structure of calcium fluoride CaF<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>]]\nFluorite crystallizes in a cubic motif. [[Crystal twinning]] is common and adds complexity to the observed [[crystal]] habits. Fluorite has four perfect cleavage planes that help produce octahedral fragments.  The structural motif adopted by fluorite is so common that the motif is called the [[fluorite structure]]. Element substitution for the [[calcium]] [[cation]] often includes certain [[rare earth element]]s (REE), such as yttrium and cerium. Iron, sodium, and barium are also common impurities. Some fluoride anions may be replaced by the [[chloride]] [[anion]].\n\n==Occurrence and mining==\n[[File:Closeup of Fluorite.jpg|thumb|left|A closeup of fluorite surface|alt=black, chevronned (wavy, jagged) structure]]\nFluorite is a widely occurring mineral with significant deposits in over 9,000 areas globally.<ref name=Mindat/> It may occur as a [[Vein (geology)|vein deposit]], especially with metallic minerals, where it often forms a part of the [[gangue]] (the surrounding \"host-rock\" in which valuable minerals occur) and may be associated with [[galena]], [[sphalerite]], [[barite]], [[quartz]], and [[calcite]]. It is a common mineral in deposits of [[hydrothermal]] origin and has been noted as a primary mineral in [[granite]]s and other [[igneous rock]]s and as a common minor constituent of [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] and [[limestone]].\n\nThe world reserves of fluorite are estimated at 230 million [[tonne]]s (Mt) with the largest deposits being in [[South Africa]] (about 41 Mt), Mexico (32 Mt) and China (24 Mt). China is leading the world production with about 3 Mt annually (in 2010), followed by Mexico (1.0 Mt), [[Mongolia]] (0.45 Mt), [[Russia]] (0.22 Mt), South Africa (0.13 Mt), Spain (0.12 Mt) and Namibia (0.11 Mt).<ref>[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/fluorspar/mcs-2011-fluor.pdf Fluorspar]. USGS.gov (2011)</ref>\n\nOne of the largest deposits of fluorspar in North America is located in the [[Burin Peninsula]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], Canada. The first official recognition of fluorspar in the area was recorded by geologist J.B. Jukes in 1843. He noted an occurrence of \"galena\" or lead ore and fluoride of lime on the west side of St. Lawrence harbour. It is recorded that interest in the commercial mining of fluorspar began in 1928 with the first ore being extracted in 1933. Eventually at Iron Springs Mine, the shafts reached depths of {{convert|970|ft|m}}. In the St. Lawrence area, the veins are persistent for great lengths and several of them have wide lenses.

Fluorescence involves the elevation of electron energy levels by quanta of ultraviolet light, followed by the progressive falling back of the electrons into their previous energy state, releasing quanta of visible light in the process. In fluorite, the visible light emitted is most commonly blue, but red, purple, yellow, green and white also occur. The fluorescence of fluorite may be due to mineral impurities, such as [[yttrium]] and [[ytterbium]], or organic matter, such as volatile [[hydrocarbons]] in the crystal lattice. In particular, the blue fluorescence seen in fluorites from certain parts of [[Great Britain]] responsible for the naming of the phenomenon of fluorescence itself, has been attributed to the presence of inclusions of divalent [[europium]] in the crystal.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Przibram|first1=K.|title=Fluorescence of Fluorite and the Bivalent Europium Ion|journal=Nature|volume=135|page=100|year=1935|doi=10.1038/135100a0|issue=3403|bibcode=1935Natur.135..100P}}</ref>\n\nOne fluorescent variety of fluorite is [[chlorophane]], which is reddish or purple in color and fluoresces brightly in emerald green when heated ([[thermoluminescence]]), or when illuminated with ultraviolet light.\n\nThe color of visible light emitted when a sample of fluorite is fluorescing depends on where the original specimen was collected; different impurities having been included in the crystal lattice in different places. Neither does all fluorite fluoresce equally brightly, even from the same locality. Therefore, ultraviolet light is not a reliable tool for the identification of specimens, nor for quantifying the mineral in mixtures. For example, among British fluorites, those from [[Northumberland]], [[County Durham]], and eastern [[Cumbria]] are the most consistently fluorescent, whereas fluorite from [[Yorkshire]], [[Derbyshire]], and [[Cornwall]], if they fluoresce at all, are generally only feebly fluorescent.\n\nFluorite also exhibits the property of [[thermoluminescence]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pNoV48kNSsC&pg=PA9|page=9|title=Thermoluminescence of Solids|author=McKeever, S.

Less common are pink, red, white, brown, and black. Color zoning or banding is commonly present.

Metallurgical grade fluorite (60\u201385% CaF<sub>2</sub>), the lowest of the three grades, has traditionally been used as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] to lower the melting point of raw materials in [[steel]] production to aid the removal of impurities, and later in the production of [[aluminium]]. Ceramic grade fluorite (85\u201395% CaF<sub>2</sub>) is used in the manufacture of [[opalescence|opalescent]] [[glass]], [[vitreous enamel|enamels]], and cooking utensils. The highest grade, \"acid grade fluorite\" (97% or more CaF<sub>2</sub>), accounts for about 95% of fluorite consumption in the US where it is used to make [[hydrogen fluoride]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]] by reacting the fluorite with [[sulfuric acid]].<ref name=usgs/>\n\nInternationally, acid-grade fluorite is also used in the production of AlF<sub>3</sub> and [[cryolite]] (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>), which are the main fluorine compounds used in aluminium smelting.

Fluorite may be drilled into beads and used in jewelry, although due to its relative softness it is not widely used as a semiprecious stone. It is also used for ornamental carvings, with expert carvings taking advantage of the stone's zonation.\n\n====Optics====\n{{See also|Fluoride glass}}\nIn the laboratory, calcium fluoride is commonly used as a window material for both [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths, since it is transparent in these regions (about 0.15&nbsp;\u00b5m to 9&nbsp;\u00b5m) and exhibits extremely low change in [[refractive index]] with wavelength. Furthermore, the material is attacked by few reagents. At wavelengths as short as 157&nbsp;nm, a common wavelength used for [[semiconductor]] stepper manufacture for [[integrated circuit]] [[photolithography|lithography]], the refractive index of calcium fluoride shows some non-linearity at high power densities, which has inhibited its use for this purpose. In the early years of the 21st century, the stepper market for calcium fluoride collapsed, and many large manufacturing facilities have been closed. [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] and other manufacturers have used synthetically grown crystals of calcium fluoride components in lenses to aid apochromatic design, and to reduce [[dispersion (optics)|light dispersion]]. This use has largely been superseded by newer glasses and computer-aided design. As an infrared optical material, calcium fluoride is widely available and was sometimes known by the [[Eastman Kodak]] trademarked name \"Irtran-3\", although this designation is obsolete.\n\nFluorite glass is a type of [[low-dispersion glass]]. [[List of lens designs|Optical groups]] made with low dispersion glass have a very low [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (color spreading), so optical groups made with fluorite elements exhibit less [[chromatic aberration]] than those utilising a traditional [[flint glass]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqTkCF6Ra9kC&pg=PA339|page=339|title=Bulk crystal growth of electronic, optical & optoelectronic materials|author=Capper, Peter |publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year= 2005|isbn=0-470-85142-2}}</ref> Optical groups employ a [[Achromatic lens|combination]] of different types of glass.

The minerals, containing small amounts of [[uranium]] and its daughter products, release radiation sufficiently energetic to induce oxidation of fluoride anions within the structure to fluorine that becomes trapped inside the mineral. The color of fetid fluorite is predominantly due to the [[calcium]] atoms remaining. Solid state fluorine-19 [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] carried out on the gas contained in the antozonite revealed a peak at 425&nbsp;ppm, which is consistent with F<sub>2</sub>.<ref>Withers, Neil (1 July 2012) [http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2012/07/fluorine-finally-found-nature Fluorine finally found in nature |Chemistry World].
