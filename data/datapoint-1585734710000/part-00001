The sound can be heard by pressing a highly tensed muscle against the ear, again a firm fist is a good example. The sound is usually described as a rumbling sound.\n\nSome individuals can voluntarily produce this rumbling sound by contracting the tensor tympani muscle of the middle ear. The rumbling sound can also be heard when the neck or jaw muscles are highly tensed as when yawning deeply.

This pulls the manubrium of the malleus inwards and tightens it. This tightening prevents the vibrations from disturbing the perilymph. Withdrawal from drugs such as [[benzodiazepine]]s had been known to cause [[tonic tensor tympani syndrome]] (TTTS) during withdrawal. The tympanic reflex will also activate when loud vibrations are generated by the person themselves. The tensor tympani can often be observed vibrating while shouting at an increased volume, dampening the sound somewhat.\n\n==Clinical significance==\nIn many people with [[hyperacusis]], an increased activity develops in the tensor tympani muscle in the middle ear as part of the startle response to some sounds. This lowered reflex threshold for tensor tympani contraction is activated by the perception/anticipation of loud sound, and is called [[tonic tensor tympani syndrome]] (TTTS). In some people with hyperacusis, the tensor tympani muscle can contract just by thinking about a loud sound. Following exposure to intolerable sounds, this contraction of the tensor tympani muscle tightens the ear drum, which can lead to the symptoms of ear pain/a fluttering sensation/a sensation of fullness in the ear (in the absence of any middle or inner ear pathology).\n\nThe mechanisms behind dysfunction of the tympanic tensor muscle and their consequences are hypotheses. However, in a published study, researchers studied the case of an acoustic shock whose mechanisms suggest dysfunction of the tympanic tensor muscle. This study appears to be the first to provide experimental support suggesting that middle ear muscles (MEM) may behave abnormally after an acoustic shock. It is suggested that abnormal contractions (e.g. tonic contractions) of the tympanic tensor muscle may trigger neurogenic inflammation. Indeed, fibers with substances P and CGRP were found in close proximity.<ref>Londero A, Charpentier N, Ponsot D, Fournier P, Pezard L and Nore\u00f1a AJ (2017) A Case of Acoustic Shock with Post-trauma Trigeminal-Autonomic Activation.
