He served as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archbishop of Cincinnati]] from 1972 until 1982, and as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Archbishop of Chicago]] from 1982 until his death in 1996 from [[pancreatic cancer]]. Bernardin was elevated to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]] in 1983 by [[Pope John Paul II]].\n\n== Biography ==\nJoseph Bernardin was born on April 2, 1928, in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], to Joseph and Maria Simion Bernardin, an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Immigration|immigrant]] couple.<ref name=unsworth/> He was baptized and confirmed at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Columbia. His father died of cancer when Bernardin was six. He took responsibility for his younger sister, Elaine, while his widowed mother worked as a [[seamstress]].\n\nBernardin's original academic ambition was to become a [[physician]], inspiring him to enroll in the pre-medical program at the [[University of South Carolina]].<ref name=unsworth/>  He then transferred to [[Saint Mary Seminary]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Philosophy]] in 1948, and subsequently enrolled in [[The Catholic University of America]] to complete his theological studies.\n\nOn April 26, 1952, Bernardin was ordained a priest of the [[Diocese of Charleston]] by [[John Joyce Russell|John J. Russell]] at St. Joseph Church. This diocese covers the entire state of [[South Carolina]]. During his 14-year tenure at the [[Diocese of Charleston]], Father Bernardin served under four bishops in capacities including [[chancellor]], [[vicar general]], diocesan counselor, and, when the [[Episcopal see|See]] was vacant, diocesan administrator. In 1959, [[Pope John XXIII]] named Bernardin a [[Papal Chamberlain]] with the title Very Reverend Monsignor.\n\n=== Auxiliary Bishop of Atlanta ===\nOn March 9, 1966 Pope [[Paul VI]] appointed [[Monsignor]] Bernardin titular Bishop of Liguria and [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of the [[Archdiocese of Atlanta]]. His episcopal consecration took place on April 26, 1966 at the hands of his mentor, the [[Archbishop]] of Atlanta, [[Paul John Hallinan|Paul Hallinan]]. Bernardin, only 38 years old, thus became the youngest bishop in America. From 1966 to 1968, Bishop Bernardin served as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the [[Cathedral of Christ the King (Atlanta, Georgia)|Cathedral of Christ the King]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\nAccording to Monsignor Kenneth Velo, a former executive aide to Bernandin and head of the Catholic Church Extension Society, it was in the predominantly Baptist American South that Bernardin learned [[ecumenism]].<ref name=\"peace\">{{Cite web|url=https://info.franciscanmedia.org/|title=Franciscan Media|first=Franciscan|last=Media|website=info.franciscanmedia.org}}</ref>\n\n=== General Secretary of National Conference ===\nIn 1968, he resigned as auxiliary bishop of Atlanta to become the first General Secretary of the [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]], a post he held until 1972. In 1969 Bishop Bernadin was instrumental in founding one of the conference's most influential and successful programs, the anti-poverty [[Catholic Campaign for Human Development|Campaign for Human Development.]]<ref name=peace/>\n\n=== Archbishop of Cincinnati ===\n[[Pope Paul VI]] appointed Bernardin [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archbishop of Cincinnati]] on November 21, 1972, and he was installed there December 19, 1972. Bernardin served the [[Metropolitan See]] of Cincinnati for nearly ten years. While there he appointed the first woman editor of the archdiocesan newspaper, ''[[The Catholic Telegraph]]''.\n\nWhile Archbishop of Cincinnati, Bernardin was named to the [[Congregation for Bishops|Sacred Congregation of Bishops]], elected to the permanent council of the [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)|Synod of Bishops]], and was elected president of the [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]].<ref name=peace/> He worked to improve relations between Catholics and [[Jews]], strove for better understanding between the Catholic Church and [[Protestant]] denominations, and made pastoral visits to both [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]].\n\n=== Archbishop of Chicago ===\nFollowing the death of Cardinal [[John Cody]] of [[Chicago]], [[Pope John Paul II]] chose Archbishop Bernardin, already prominent among his fellow American bishops, to lead the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]].  He was appointed the twelfth Bishop and seventh Archbishop of Chicago on July 10, 1982. On August 25, 1982, he was formally installed in that role by the [[Apostolic Delegate]], [[Pio Laghi]]. Bernardin found an archdiocese in disarray, its priests disheartened by years of arbitrary administration and charges of financial misconduct. \"With his patient charm and willingness to listen, Bernardin won back the confidence of the clergy and the laity....\"<ref name=nytm>[[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/01/magazine/death-as-a-friend.html?pagewanted=all Death as a Friend] \"Death as a Friend\", ''The New York Times Magazine\", December 1, 1996]</ref>\n\n=== Elevation to Cardinal ===\nIn the [[Papal consistory|Consistory]] of February 2, 1983, he was elevated to the Sacred College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''Ges\u00f9 Divino Lavoratore'' ([[Jesus the Divine Worker]]) as his [[titular church]].\n\n=== Honorary degrees and awards ===\nIn 1989, Bernardin was awarded the F. Sadlier Dinger Award by educational publisher [[William H.

Former seminarian Stephen Cook claimed to have been abused by Bernardin and another priest in the 1970s. However, Cook subsequently dropped Bernardin from his lawsuit, being no longer certain that his memories, which had emerged while he was under hypnosis, were accurate. The two later reconciled. Cook later said that he had relied on people who told him things that were not true, \"asserting that he is absolutely convinced of Bernardin's innocence\".<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-01-05/news/9501050333_1_cardinal-bernardin-steven-cook-rev-ellis-harsham Galloway, Paul. \"Bernardin, Ex-accuser Reconcile\"], ''Chicago Tribune'', January. 5, 1995</ref>\n\n=== Final illness ===\n[[Image:BishopsMausoleumAug2004.jpg|thumbnail|right|260px|Cardinal Bernardin's Final Resting Place]]\nIn June 1995, following a string of international visits and pilgrimages, Bernardin underwent surgery for [[pancreatic cancer]]. On August 30, 1996, Bernardin told his flock that the cancer had returned, was in his liver, and was inoperable. He turned over the day-to-day administration of the Archdiocese to his vicar general and auxiliary bishop, Most Rev. Raymond Goedert. Bernardin then began to focus much of his ministry on the sick, and became the \"unofficial chaplain\" to Chicago cancer patients.<ref name=Feister>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Feb1997/feature2.asp Feister, John Bookser. \"Cardinal Joseph L. Bernadin\", ''St. Anthony Messenger'']</ref>\n\nOn September 23, Bernardin traveled to [[Rome]] to visit with [[Pope John Paul II]] and visit [[Assisi]]. It was on that trip that Bernardin made his funerary arrangements. Upon his return to Chicago, he arranged for the care for his mother, whom he visited daily at her nursing home,<ref name=Feister/> and the distribution of his personal possessions. Bernardin arranged for his personal papers and administrative files to be transported from the Residence and Pastoral Center to the Archdiocese of Chicago's Archives and Records Center.\n\nTwo weeks before his death, he completed his best-selling book about the end of life and about his own approaching death in particular, called ''The Gift Of Peace'', with the help of his friend and biographer [[Eugene Kennedy]].<ref name=\"peace\"/>\n\nIn his final weeks, he was also awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President Bill Clinton. He gave a major \"Seamless Garment of Life\" address at Georgetown University, where he received an award from and conversed with Father [[Leo J. O'Donovan]], S.J., then Georgetown's president.\n\nHe said goodbye to 800 of the diocesan and religious clergy of the Archdiocese at Holy Name Cathedral weeks before his death. On October 7, Bernardin met with the Presbyterate, and by the end of October, he withdrew from his active ministry due to his deteriorating strength. In his last days, Bernardin wrote to the [[United States Supreme Court]] against [[assisted suicide]].\n\nOn November 14, 1996, Bernardin died from [[pancreatic cancer]] at the age of 68.\n\nThe funeral [[homily]] was given by his friend Reverend Monsignor Kenneth Velo. In the weeks before his death, Bernardin emphasized to the faithful and the public that he was at peace because of his life's profound reliance on God's sustaining grace in his ministry and his struggles with cancer, seeing death as \"a continuation and a friend to prepare properly for by conducting ourselves well and letting go to abandon one's self to God in the end\". He was interred in the Bishops' Mausoleum at [[Mount Carmel Cemetery (Hillside)|Mt. Carmel Cemetery]], [[Hillside, Illinois]], following a [[Funeral Mass]] celebrated by his good friend, Cardinal [[Roger Mahony]], and a wake for priests at which his good friend Father Scott Donahue spoke.\n\n== Views ==\n=== Seamless garment of life ===\nIn 1983 Bernardin developed the \"[[Consistent Life Ethic|Consistent Ethic of Life]]\" (or CLE) ideology, which expressed his response to living in an age in which he believed modern technologies threatened the sanctity of human life. Bernardin's CLE philosophy is sometimes called the \"[[seamless garment]]\", a reference from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&chapter=19&verse=22&end_verse=24&version=49&context=context John 19:23] to the [[seamless robe of Jesus]]. The seamless garment philosophy holds that issues such as abortion, capital punishment, militarism, euthanasia, social injustice, and economic injustice all demand a consistent application of moral principles that value the sacredness of human life (as defined by the Catholic Church). In response to critiques from some [[anti-abortion]] activists, Bernardin said that the ethic did not describe all threats to life as equal but that all were related: \"A systemic vision of life seeks to expand the moral imagination of a society, not partition it into airtight categories. ... A consistent ethic of life seeks to present a coherent linkage among a diverse set of issues. It can and should be used to test party platforms, public policies, and political candidates.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bernardinwade.html|title=A Consistent Ethic of Life: Continuing the Dialogue|website=www.priestsforlife.org|access-date=May 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Other social issues ===\n\nIn 1981, Bernardin became head of the new [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops|NCCB]] Ad Hoc Committee on War and Peace, formed to draft a pastoral letter on nuclear proliferation.<ref name=\"McBrady 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=McBrady |first1=Jared |title=The Challenge of Peace: Ronald Reagan, John Paul II, and the American Bishops |journal=Journal of Cold War Studies |date=January 2015 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=129\u2013152 |doi=10.1162/JCWS_a_00533 |url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/JCWS_a_00533 |language=en |issn=1520-3972}}</ref> The resulting book-length letter, \"[[The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response]]\", was published in 1983.<ref name=\"McBrady 2015\"/> An influential statement of [[Catholic social teaching]], the document condemns nuclear warfare<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hansen |first1=Luke |title='The Challenge of Peace' Today |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/challenge-peace-today |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=America Magazine |date=3 May 2013 |language=en}}</ref> and states that [[nuclear deterrence]] is \"not an adequate strategy as a long-term basis for peace; it is a transitional strategy justifiable only in conjunction with resolute determination to pursue arms control and disarmament\".<ref>{{cite document |url=http://www.usccb.org/upload/challenge-peace-gods-promise-our-response-1983.pdf|title=The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response|publisher=USCCB}}</ref> In relation to his work on the nuclear question, Bernardin was featured on the front cover of a 1982 issue of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' entitled \"God and the Bomb\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last1=Smith |editor-first1=Frank J. |work=Religion and Politics in America: An Encyclopedia of Church and State in American Life |date=2016 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-436-8 |title=Bernardin, Cardinal Joseph Louis (1928\u20131996)|last=Ortiz|first=Fernando A.|pages=55\u201356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWxyDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA56 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Ostling |first1=Richard N. |title=Bishops and the Bomb |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955097,00.html |work=Time |date=29 November 1982}}</ref>\n\nBernardin became a mediator between the diverging parties in the changing Post-Conciliar Church.

He served as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archbishop of Cincinnati]] from 1972 until 1982, and as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Archbishop of Chicago]] from 1982 until his death in 1996 from [[pancreatic cancer]]. Bernardin was elevated to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]] in 1983 by [[Pope John Paul II]].\n\n== Biography ==\nJoseph Bernardin was born on April 2, 1928, in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], to Joseph and Maria Simion Bernardin, an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Immigration|immigrant]] couple.<ref name=unsworth/> He was baptized and confirmed at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Columbia. His father died of cancer when Bernardin was six. He took responsibility for his younger sister, Elaine, while his widowed mother worked as a [[seamstress]].\n\nBernardin's original academic ambition was to become a [[physician]], inspiring him to enroll in the pre-medical program at the [[University of South Carolina]].<ref name=unsworth/>  He then transferred to [[Saint Mary Seminary]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Philosophy]] in 1948, and subsequently enrolled in [[The Catholic University of America]] to complete his theological studies.\n\nOn April 26, 1952, Bernardin was ordained a priest of the [[Diocese of Charleston]] by [[John Joyce Russell|John J. Russell]] at St. Joseph Church. This diocese covers the entire state of [[South Carolina]]. During his 14-year tenure at the [[Diocese of Charleston]], Father Bernardin served under four bishops in capacities including [[chancellor]], [[vicar general]], diocesan counselor, and, when the [[Episcopal see|See]] was vacant, diocesan administrator. In 1959, [[Pope John XXIII]] named Bernardin a [[Papal Chamberlain]] with the title Very Reverend Monsignor.\n\n=== Auxiliary Bishop of Atlanta ===\nOn March 9, 1966 Pope [[Paul VI]] appointed [[Monsignor]] Bernardin titular Bishop of Liguria and [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of the [[Archdiocese of Atlanta]]. His episcopal consecration took place on April 26, 1966 at the hands of his mentor, the [[Archbishop]] of Atlanta, [[Paul John Hallinan|Paul Hallinan]]. Bernardin, only 38 years old, thus became the youngest bishop in America. From 1966 to 1968, Bishop Bernardin served as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the [[Cathedral of Christ the King (Atlanta, Georgia)|Cathedral of Christ the King]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\nAccording to Monsignor Kenneth Velo, a former executive aide to Bernandin and head of the Catholic Church Extension Society, it was in the predominantly Baptist American South that Bernardin learned [[ecumenism]].<ref name=\"peace\">{{Cite web|url=https://info.franciscanmedia.org/|title=Franciscan Media|first=Franciscan|last=Media|website=info.franciscanmedia.org}}</ref>\n\n=== General Secretary of National Conference ===\nIn 1968, he resigned as auxiliary bishop of Atlanta to become the first General Secretary of the [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]], a post he held until 1972. In 1969 Bishop Bernadin was instrumental in founding one of the conference's most influential and successful programs, the anti-poverty [[Catholic Campaign for Human Development|Campaign for Human Development.]]<ref name=peace/>\n\n=== Archbishop of Cincinnati ===\n[[Pope Paul VI]] appointed Bernardin [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archbishop of Cincinnati]] on November 21, 1972, and he was installed there December 19, 1972. Bernardin served the [[Metropolitan See]] of Cincinnati for nearly ten years. While there he appointed the first woman editor of the archdiocesan newspaper, ''[[The Catholic Telegraph]]''.\n\nWhile Archbishop of Cincinnati, Bernardin was named to the [[Congregation for Bishops|Sacred Congregation of Bishops]], elected to the permanent council of the [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)|Synod of Bishops]], and was elected president of the [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]].<ref name=peace/> He worked to improve relations between Catholics and [[Jews]], strove for better understanding between the Catholic Church and [[Protestant]] denominations, and made pastoral visits to both [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]].\n\n=== Archbishop of Chicago ===\nFollowing the death of Cardinal [[John Cody]] of [[Chicago]], [[Pope John Paul II]] chose Archbishop Bernardin, already prominent among his fellow American bishops, to lead the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]].  He was appointed the twelfth Bishop and seventh Archbishop of Chicago on July 10, 1982. On August 25, 1982, he was formally installed in that role by the [[Apostolic Delegate]], [[Pio Laghi]]. Bernardin found an archdiocese in disarray, its priests disheartened by years of arbitrary administration and charges of financial misconduct. \"With his patient charm and willingness to listen, Bernardin won back the confidence of the clergy and the laity....\"<ref name=nytm>[[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/01/magazine/death-as-a-friend.html?pagewanted=all Death as a Friend] \"Death as a Friend\", ''The New York Times Magazine\", December 1, 1996]</ref>\n\n=== Elevation to Cardinal ===\nIn the [[Papal consistory|Consistory]] of February 2, 1983, he was elevated to the Sacred College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''Ges\u00f9 Divino Lavoratore'' ([[Jesus the Divine Worker]]) as his [[titular church]].\n\n=== Honorary degrees and awards ===\nIn 1989, Bernardin was awarded the F.

Former seminarian Stephen Cook claimed to have been abused by Bernardin and another priest in the 1970s. However, Cook subsequently dropped Bernardin from his lawsuit, being no longer certain that his memories, which had emerged while he was under hypnosis, were accurate. The two later reconciled. Cook later said that he had relied on people who told him things that were not true, \"asserting that he is absolutely convinced of Bernardin's innocence\".<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-01-05/news/9501050333_1_cardinal-bernardin-steven-cook-rev-ellis-harsham Galloway, Paul. \"Bernardin, Ex-accuser Reconcile\"], ''Chicago Tribune'', January. 5, 1995</ref>\n\n=== Final illness ===\n[[Image:BishopsMausoleumAug2004.jpg|thumbnail|right|260px|Cardinal Bernardin's Final Resting Place]]\nIn June 1995, following a string of international visits and pilgrimages, Bernardin underwent surgery for [[pancreatic cancer]]. On August 30, 1996, Bernardin told his flock that the cancer had returned, was in his liver, and was inoperable. He turned over the day-to-day administration of the Archdiocese to his vicar general and auxiliary bishop, Most Rev. Raymond Goedert. Bernardin then began to focus much of his ministry on the sick, and became the \"unofficial chaplain\" to Chicago cancer patients.<ref name=Feister>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Feb1997/feature2.asp Feister, John Bookser. \"Cardinal Joseph L. Bernadin\", ''St. Anthony Messenger'']</ref>\n\nOn September 23, Bernardin traveled to [[Rome]] to visit with [[Pope John Paul II]] and visit [[Assisi]]. It was on that trip that Bernardin made his funerary arrangements. Upon his return to Chicago, he arranged for the care for his mother, whom he visited daily at her nursing home,<ref name=Feister/> and the distribution of his personal possessions. Bernardin arranged for his personal papers and administrative files to be transported from the Residence and Pastoral Center to the Archdiocese of Chicago's Archives and Records Center.\n\nTwo weeks before his death, he completed his best-selling book about the end of life and about his own approaching death in particular, called ''The Gift Of Peace'', with the help of his friend and biographer [[Eugene Kennedy]].<ref name=\"peace\"/>\n\nIn his final weeks, he was also awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President Bill Clinton. He gave a major \"Seamless Garment of Life\" address at Georgetown University, where he received an award from and conversed with Father [[Leo J. O'Donovan]], S.J., then Georgetown's president.\n\nHe said goodbye to 800 of the diocesan and religious clergy of the Archdiocese at Holy Name Cathedral weeks before his death. On October 7, Bernardin met with the Presbyterate, and by the end of October, he withdrew from his active ministry due to his deteriorating strength. In his last days, Bernardin wrote to the [[United States Supreme Court]] against [[assisted suicide]].\n\nOn November 14, 1996, Bernardin died from [[pancreatic cancer]] at the age of 68.\n\nThe funeral [[homily]] was given by his friend Reverend Monsignor Kenneth Velo. In the weeks before his death, Bernardin emphasized to the faithful and the public that he was at peace because of his life's profound reliance on God's sustaining grace in his ministry and his struggles with cancer, seeing death as \"a continuation and a friend to prepare properly for by conducting ourselves well and letting go to abandon one's self to God in the end\". He was interred in the Bishops' Mausoleum at [[Mount Carmel Cemetery (Hillside)|Mt. Carmel Cemetery]], [[Hillside, Illinois]], following a [[Funeral Mass]] celebrated by his good friend, Cardinal [[Roger Mahony]], and a wake for priests at which his good friend Father Scott Donahue spoke.\n\n== Views ==\n=== Seamless garment of life ===\nIn 1983 Bernardin developed the \"[[Consistent Life Ethic|Consistent Ethic of Life]]\" (or CLE) ideology, which expressed his response to living in an age in which he believed modern technologies threatened the sanctity of human life. Bernardin's CLE philosophy is sometimes called the \"[[seamless garment]]\", a reference from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&chapter=19&verse=22&end_verse=24&version=49&context=context John 19:23] to the [[seamless robe of Jesus]]. The seamless garment philosophy holds that issues such as abortion, capital punishment, militarism, euthanasia, social injustice, and economic injustice all demand a consistent application of moral principles that value the sacredness of human life (as defined by the Catholic Church). In response to critiques from some [[anti-abortion]] activists, Bernardin said that the ethic did not describe all threats to life as equal but that all were related: \"A systemic vision of life seeks to expand the moral imagination of a society, not partition it into airtight categories. ... A consistent ethic of life seeks to present a coherent linkage among a diverse set of issues. It can and should be used to test party platforms, public policies, and political candidates.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bernardinwade.html|title=A Consistent Ethic of Life: Continuing the Dialogue|website=www.priestsforlife.org|access-date=May 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Other social issues ===\n\nIn 1981, Bernardin became head of the new [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops|NCCB]] Ad Hoc Committee on War and Peace, formed to draft a pastoral letter on nuclear proliferation.<ref name=\"McBrady 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=McBrady |first1=Jared |title=The Challenge of Peace: Ronald Reagan, John Paul II, and the American Bishops |journal=Journal of Cold War Studies |date=January 2015 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=129\u2013152 |doi=10.1162/JCWS_a_00533 |url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/JCWS_a_00533 |language=en |issn=1520-3972}}</ref> The resulting book-length letter, \"[[The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response]]\", was published in 1983.<ref name=\"McBrady 2015\"/> An influential statement of [[Catholic social teaching]], the document condemns nuclear warfare<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hansen |first1=Luke |title='The Challenge of Peace' Today |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/challenge-peace-today |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=America Magazine |date=3 May 2013 |language=en}}</ref> and states that [[nuclear deterrence]] is \"not an adequate strategy as a long-term basis for peace; it is a transitional strategy justifiable only in conjunction with resolute determination to pursue arms control and disarmament\".<ref>{{cite document |url=http://www.usccb.org/upload/challenge-peace-gods-promise-our-response-1983.pdf|title=The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response|publisher=USCCB}}</ref> In relation to his work on the nuclear question, Bernardin was featured on the front cover of a 1982 issue of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' entitled \"God and the Bomb\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last1=Smith |editor-first1=Frank J. |work=Religion and Politics in America: An Encyclopedia of Church and State in American Life |date=2016 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-436-8 |title=Bernardin, Cardinal Joseph Louis (1928\u20131996)|last=Ortiz|first=Fernando A.|pages=55\u201356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWxyDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA56 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Ostling |first1=Richard N. |title=Bishops and the Bomb |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955097,00.html |work=Time |date=29 November 1982}}</ref>\n\nBernardin became a mediator between the diverging parties in the changing Post-Conciliar Church.
