It lies like an army facing south, with one wing stretching along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean and the other reaching out to the Persian Gulf, while the center has its back against the northern mountains. The end of the western wing is Palestine; Assyria makes up a large part of the center; while the end of the eastern wing is Babylonia.<br/><br/>This great semicircle, for lack of a name, may be called the Fertile Crescent.<sup>1</sup> It may also be likened to the shores of a desert-bay, upon which the mountains behind look down\u2014a bay not of water but of sandy waste, some {{convert|500|mi|abbr=off|spell=on|disp=out}} across, forming a northern extension of the Arabian desert and sweeping as far north as the latitude of the northeast corner of the Mediterranean. This desert-bay is a limestone plateau of some height\u2014too high indeed to be watered by the Tigris and Euphrates, which have cut ca\u00f1ons obliquely across it. Nevertheless, after the meager winter rains, wide tracts of the northern desert-bay are clothed with scanty grass, and spring thus turns the region for a short time into grasslands. The history of Western Asia may be described as an age-long struggle between the mountain peoples of the north and the desert wanderers of these grasslands\u2014a struggle which is still going on\u2014for the possession of the Fertile Crescent, the shores of the desert-bay.<br/><br/><sup>1</sup> There is no name, either geographical or political, which includes all of this great semicircle (see map, p. 100). Hence we are obliged to coin a term and call it the Fertile Crescent.</blockquote>\n\nIn current usage, the Fertile Crescent includes [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], and [[Jordan]], as well as the surrounding portions of [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]. In addition to the Tigris and Euphrates, riverwater sources include the [[Jordan River]]. The inner boundary is delimited by the dry climate of the [[Syrian Desert]] to the south. Around the outer boundary are the [[Anatolia]]n and [[Armenian highlands]] to the north, the [[Sahara Desert]] to the west, [[Sudan]] to the south, and the [[Iranian Plateau]] to the east.\n\n==Biodiversity and climate==\nAs crucial as rivers and [[marsh]]lands were to the [[Cradle of civilization|rise of civilization]] in the Fertile Crescent, they were not the only factor. The area is geographically important as the \"bridge\" between [[North Africa]] and [[Eurasia]], which has allowed it to retain a greater amount of [[biodiversity]] than either [[Europe]] or [[North Africa]], where [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]]s during the [[Ice Age]] led to repeated [[extinction]] events when ecosystems became squeezed against the waters of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The [[Saharan pump theory]] posits that this Middle Eastern [[land bridge]] was extremely important to the modern distribution of [[Old World]] [[flora]] and [[fauna]], including the [[Early human migrations|spread of humanity]].\n\nThe area has borne the brunt of the [[Divergent boundary|tectonic divergence]] between the African and Arabian [[tectonic plates|plates]] and the converging Arabian and Eurasian plates, which has made the region a very diverse zone of high snow-covered mountains.\n\nThe Fertile Crescent had many diverse [[climate]]s, and major climatic changes encouraged the evolution of many [[r/K strategy|\"r\" type]] [[annual plant]]s, which produce more edible seeds than [[r/K strategy|\"K\" type]] [[perennial plant]]s. The region's dramatic variety in elevation gave rise to many species of edible plants for early experiments in cultivation. Most importantly, the Fertile Crescent was home to the eight [[Neolithic founder crops]] important in early [[agriculture]] (i.e., wild progenitors to [[emmer|emmer wheat]], [[einkorn]], [[barley]], [[flax]], [[chick pea]], [[pea]], [[lentil]], [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]]), and four of the five most important species of [[domestication|domesticated]] animals\u2014[[cow]]s, [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[pig]]s; the fifth species, the [[horse]], lived nearby.<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\">{{cite book|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |last=Diamond |first=Jared |author-link=Jared Diamond |date=March 1997 |publisher=[[W.W.

It lies like an army facing south, with one wing stretching along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean and the other reaching out to the Persian Gulf, while the center has its back against the northern mountains. The end of the western wing is Palestine; Assyria makes up a large part of the center; while the end of the eastern wing is Babylonia.<br/><br/>This great semicircle, for lack of a name, may be called the Fertile Crescent.<sup>1</sup> It may also be likened to the shores of a desert-bay, upon which the mountains behind look down\u2014a bay not of water but of sandy waste, some {{convert|500|mi|abbr=off|spell=on|disp=out}} across, forming a northern extension of the Arabian desert and sweeping as far north as the latitude of the northeast corner of the Mediterranean. This desert-bay is a limestone plateau of some height\u2014too high indeed to be watered by the Tigris and Euphrates, which have cut ca\u00f1ons obliquely across it. Nevertheless, after the meager winter rains, wide tracts of the northern desert-bay are clothed with scanty grass, and spring thus turns the region for a short time into grasslands. The history of Western Asia may be described as an age-long struggle between the mountain peoples of the north and the desert wanderers of these grasslands\u2014a struggle which is still going on\u2014for the possession of the Fertile Crescent, the shores of the desert-bay.<br/><br/><sup>1</sup> There is no name, either geographical or political, which includes all of this great semicircle (see map, p. 100). Hence we are obliged to coin a term and call it the Fertile Crescent.</blockquote>\n\nIn current usage, the Fertile Crescent includes [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], and [[Jordan]], as well as the surrounding portions of [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]. In addition to the Tigris and Euphrates, riverwater sources include the [[Jordan River]]. The inner boundary is delimited by the dry climate of the [[Syrian Desert]] to the south. Around the outer boundary are the [[Anatolia]]n and [[Armenian highlands]] to the north, the [[Sahara Desert]] to the west, [[Sudan]] to the south, and the [[Iranian Plateau]] to the east.\n\n==Biodiversity and climate==\nAs crucial as rivers and [[marsh]]lands were to the [[Cradle of civilization|rise of civilization]] in the Fertile Crescent, they were not the only factor. The area is geographically important as the \"bridge\" between [[North Africa]] and [[Eurasia]], which has allowed it to retain a greater amount of [[biodiversity]] than either [[Europe]] or [[North Africa]], where [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]]s during the [[Ice Age]] led to repeated [[extinction]] events when ecosystems became squeezed against the waters of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The [[Saharan pump theory]] posits that this Middle Eastern [[land bridge]] was extremely important to the modern distribution of [[Old World]] [[flora]] and [[fauna]], including the [[Early human migrations|spread of humanity]].\n\nThe area has borne the brunt of the [[Divergent boundary|tectonic divergence]] between the African and Arabian [[tectonic plates|plates]] and the converging Arabian and Eurasian plates, which has made the region a very diverse zone of high snow-covered mountains.\n\nThe Fertile Crescent had many diverse [[climate]]s, and major climatic changes encouraged the evolution of many [[r/K strategy|\"r\" type]] [[annual plant]]s, which produce more edible seeds than [[r/K strategy|\"K\" type]] [[perennial plant]]s. The region's dramatic variety in elevation gave rise to many species of edible plants for early experiments in cultivation. Most importantly, the Fertile Crescent was home to the eight [[Neolithic founder crops]] important in early [[agriculture]] (i.e., wild progenitors to [[emmer|emmer wheat]], [[einkorn]], [[barley]], [[flax]], [[chick pea]], [[pea]], [[lentil]], [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]]), and four of the five most important species of [[domestication|domesticated]] animals\u2014[[cow]]s, [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[pig]]s; the fifth species, the [[horse]], lived nearby.<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\">{{cite book|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |last=Diamond |first=Jared |author-link=Jared Diamond |date=March 1997 |publisher=[[W.W.

This is contrary to the suggestion that the spread of agriculture disseminated out of the Fertile Crescent by way of sharing of knowledge. Instead the view now supported by a preponderance of the evidence is that it occurred by actual migration out of the region, coupled with subsequent interbreeding with indigenous local populations whom the migrants came in contact with.<ref name=\"PNAS\"/>\n\nThe studies show also that not all present day [[Europe]]ans share strong genetic affinities to the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] inhabitants of the Fertile Crescent;<ref name=\"PNAS\"/> instead the closest ties to the Fertile Crescent rest with [[Southern Europe]]ans.<ref name=\"PNAS\"/> The same study further demonstrates all present-day [[Europe]]ans to be closely related.<ref name=\"PNAS\"/>\n\n==Languages==\n[[File:Diffusion of agriculture from the Fertile Crescent after 9000 BC.jpg|thumb|Diffusion of agriculture from the Fertile Crescent after 9000 BCE]]\nLinguistically, the Fertile Crescent was a region of great diversity. Historically, [[Semitic languages]] generally prevailed in the modern regions of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Palestine]], [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and  the fringes of southeast [[Turkey]] and northwest [[Iran]], as well as the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] (a [[Language Isolate]]) in Iraq, whilst in the mountainous areas to the east and north a number of generally unrelated [[language isolates]] were found, including; [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Gutian language|Gutian]] and [[Kassite language|Kassite]] in [[Iran]], and [[Hattic language|Hattic]], [[Kaskian language|Kaskian]] and [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartian]] in [[Turkey]]. The precise affiliation of these, and their date of arrival, remain topics of scholarly discussion. However, given lack of textual evidence for the earliest era of prehistory, this debate is unlikely to be resolved in the near future.\n\nThe evidence that does exist suggests that, by the third millennium BCE and into the second, several language groups already existed in the region.
