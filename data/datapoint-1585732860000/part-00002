registered as respiratory complications or [[influenza]]. They put their estimate of the number of infections at 16,000 in Tehran alone when the official figure given was 20,610 for the whole country on that date.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://en.radiofarda.com/a/exclusive-more-than-47-000-coronavirus-patients-in-iran-hospitals-2-216-dead/30501369.html |title=Exclusive: More Than 47,000 Coronavirus Patients In Iran Hospitals, 2,216 Dead |date=March 21, 2020|work=Radio Farda}}</ref>\n\n==== Satellite imagery from Qom cemetery ====\n[[Image:3407559 \u062a\u062f\u0641\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u062a\u0648\u0641\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0628\u062a\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u0634\u062a \u0645\u0639\u0635\u0648\u0645\u0647.jpg|thumb|250px|Burial site at Qom's Behesht Masoumeh Cemetery]]\nOn 12 March, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published satellite images and analysis provided by [[Maxar Technologies]], saying that vast burial pits were being excavated near Qom, said to be used to accommodate the potentially increasing number of victims in the city. The digging of the new section of burial pits began on 21 February, only two days after the government announced their first cases of COVID-19, and then rapidly expanded. The number of fresh graves suggests preparation for a far larger number of deaths.<ref>*{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/iran-coronavirus-outbreak-graves|title=Coronavirus burial pit so vast they're visible from space|first1=Erin|last1=Cunningham|first2=Dalton|last2=Bennett|date=12 March 2020|work=The Washington Post|access-date=13 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200313055935/https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/iran-coronavirus-outbreak-graves/|archive-date=13 March 2020|url-status=live}}\n*{{YouTube|id=fjuWyXzKBIw|title=Iran is building a massive grave for coronavirus victims}}. published on 13 March 2020 by The Washington Post</ref> Qom municipality official responsible for the city's burial sites said \"the graves had been planned before the outbreak as part of usual procedures in the cemetery\", and some observers pointed that overall length of the purported 100 yards cannot accommodate more than about 75-100 graves.<ref>{{citation|title=Washington Post hypes fake news on coronavirus 'burial pits' in Iran|url=https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/03/14/620825/Washington-Post-fake-news-coronavirus-burial-Iran|work=Press TV|date=14 March 2020|access-date=14 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314124434/https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/03/14/620825/Washington-Post-fake-news-coronavirus-burial-Iran|archive-date=14 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic by country and territory]]\n*[[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Asia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{COVID-19}}\n{{Iran topics}}\n\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in Iran| ]]\n[[Category:2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic by country and territory|Iran]]\n[[Category:2020 disasters in Iran]]\n[[Category:Medical outbreaks in Iran]]\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in Asia|Iran]]\n", "name_user": "Jerome Charles Potts", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFebruary 2020:What's a \"cluster\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Iran"}
