He was fondly known as '''Reb Burech Hermanshtater'''.\n\nBorn in [[Michalovce]], [[Slovakia]] (then [[Zempl\u00e9n County]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]]), as a young child he was already recognized by all who met him as an extremely devout and diligent student. He learned in [[Kisv\u00e1rda]] by the famed author of the ''Arugas Habosem'', Rabbi [[Moshe Greenwald]] and soon became one of the top students there. Reb [[Yechezkel Shraga Halberstam]], the Shinover Rebbe, spoke very highly of Reb Boruch held him in high esteem. Rabbi Boruch Greenfield married Rivkah Weinberger in 1891 in [[Stropkov]] where he founded a small [[yeshiva]] at that time. Later he became the [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|Dayan]] of ''Shebesh, Potneck, and [[Hermenshtat]]'', where he founded the Orthodox Sephardic community he served as the interim Rabbi of ''[[Klausenberg]]'' (where he was also instrumental in founding the Orthodox Sephardic community) shortly before coming to the USA.\n\nIn 1923 he immigrated to the United States where he served as the Rabbi in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania]], [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]], [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]], and the [[Lower East Side]] at the 52 Cannon Street [[Shul]]. He was extremely upset with the laxness in which Torah Judaism was being led and he fought this laxness fiercely. In 1935 he moved to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and upon his arrival was offered a number of high rabbinical posts. As in previous times during his life, due to his great humility he declined such positions, but was, however, one of the leaders of the [[Edah HaChareidis]].\n\nReb Borech was close with the Satmar Rebbe, Rabbi [[Yoel Teitelbaum]], and they learned together daily for a period of time. He was also close to the Belzer Rebbe Rabbi [[Aharon Rokeach]] who highly respected Reb Borech and spoke well of him.\n\nBesides his fame as a great Torah Scholar, Rabbi Greenfield was talented musically and a baal tefillah [[Chazan]]. In 1975 a [[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefer]] with a small collection of his writings was printed under the name ''Ohel Boruch''.\n\nReb Burech had five children that reached adulthood. The oldest was Mariam who married Reb Nusen Baumhaft, the Rosh Yeshiva of Klausenberg. Nusen, Mariam and fourteen of their children, perished in the Holocaust. One of Mariam's children, Sidonia, also known as Silka, survived. After the war Sidonia married and had three children. Reb Burech's second child was Ruchel who married a fine Torah scholar named Reb Ahron Klausner. The Klausners had two children. His third child was Eidel, married to Reb Shimon Fischman; they were childless. His fourth child, Mirel, married Reb Chaim Pall. She died during childbirth and was left childless. His fifth child, Sarah, married Reb Dovid Yaakov Friedman and they had six daughters.\n\n== Sources ==\n# ''Ohel Boruch''\n# ''Moshian Shel Yisroel'', by Shloima Yankel Gelbman\n# {{cite book|title=Chachmei Tranyslvania|year=1989|author=Yitzchak Yosef HaCohen|publisher=Machon Yerushalayim}}\n# {{cite book|title=Sefer Zichron Stropkov|author=Weinstein, Avraham Avish Hacohen|location=Brooklyn|publisher=Deutsch Publishing and Printing Company|year=1968}}\n# ''Lkoros Hayhadus BTranselvany'' by Tzvi Yaakov Abraham pub. 1951\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/Stropkov/str002.html#episode The Chevra Shas \u2014 (Talmud study group)]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greenfeld, Boruch}}\n[[Category:1872 births]]\n[[Category:1956 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Michalovce]]\n[[Category:Hungarian Orthodox rabbis]]\n[[Category:Hasidic rabbis in Europe]]\n[[Category:American Hasidic rabbis]]\n[[Category:Rabbis in Mandatory Palestine]]\n[[Category:Rabbis of the Edah HaChareidis]]\n[[Category:Hasidic rabbis in Israel]]\n[[Category:Hazzans]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Rabbi Boruch Greenfeld of Hermanshtat 1872-1956.jpg|thumb|Rabbi Boruch Greenfeld of Hermanshtat]] -->\nRabbi '''Boruch Greenfield''', (1872\u20131956), was a [[rabbi]] and [[Torah]] scholar.
