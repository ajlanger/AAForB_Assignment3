In 1978, the first female recruits entered basic training at Fort Dix. In 1991, Dix trained [[Kuwait]]i civilians in basic military skills so they could take part in their country's liberation.<ref name=\"Dix\"/>\n\nDix ended its active Army training mission in 1991 due to [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] recommendations, which ended its command by a two-star general. Presently, it serves as a joint training site for all military components and all services.\n\nIn 2009 Fort Dix, and the adjacent Air Force and Naval facilities were consolidated into a single secure facility, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.  The supporting component is the [[United States Air Force]], and base operations are executed by the [[87th Air Base Wing]] (87 ABW). The 87 ABW provides installation management to all of JBMDL while both the Navy and Army retain command and control of their mission, personnel, equipment and component-specific services. Neither the Navy nor the Army bases are subordinate to the Joint Base; each are simply supported by the joint base in base operations such as utilities, child care centers, gyms, and other services, but each report through their own service-specific command chains and have their own commanders (the Navy a Captain and the Army a Colonel).

Between the World Wars, Camp Dix was a reception, training and discharge center for the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Camp Dix became Fort Dix on March 8, 1939, and the installation became a permanent Army post. During and after [[World War II]] the fort served the same purpose as in the first World War. It served as a training and staging ground during the war and a demobilization center after the war.\n\nOn July 15, 1947, Fort Dix became a [[Recruit training|basic training]] center and the home of the [[U.S. 9th Infantry Division|9th Infantry Division]]. In 1954, the 9th moved out and the 69th Infantry Division made the fort home until it was deactivated on March 16, 1956. During the [[Vietnam War]] rapid expansion took place. A mock [[Vietnam]] village was constructed and soldiers received Vietnam-specific training before being deployed. Since Vietnam, Fort Dix has sent soldiers to Operation [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]], [[Desert Storm]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]].\n\n===U.S. Coast Guard site===\nThe [[Atlantic Strike Team]] (AST) of the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] is based at Fort Dix.

The [[USAF]] moved the Security Police Air Base Ground Defence school from [[Camp Bullis]], Texas, to Dix in fall 1987. It was eventually realized that it was not cost effective to put 50\u2013100 S.P. trainees on a commercial flight from San Antonio, Texas, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, every couple of weeks, so the school was later moved back to Camp Bullis, Texas.\n\nFort Dix was an early casualty of the first [[Base Realignment and Closure]] process in the early 1990s, after having lost it traditional basic-training mission. But Fort Dix advocates attracted Army Reserve interest in keeping the {{convert|31000|acre|ha|adj=on}} post as a training reservation. With the reserves, and millions of dollars for improvements, Fort Dix has grown again to employ 3,000. As many as 15,000 troops train there on weekends, and the post has been a major mobilization point for reserve and National Guard troops since the [[September 11 attacks]] on [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nFort Dix has completed its realignment from an individual training center to a [[United States Army Forces Command|FORSCOM]] Power Projection Platform for the Northeastern United States under the command and control of the Army's Installation Management Command. Primary missions include training and providing regional base operations support to on-post and off-post active component and U.S Army Reserve units, soldiers, families and retirees. Fort Dix supported more than 1.1 million man-days of training in 1998. A daily average of more than 13,500 persons live or work within the garrison and its tenant organizations. [[Fort Devens|Devens Reserve Force Training Area, MA]] is a sub-installation of the ASA.\n\n===2005 realignments===\n{{main|Base Realignment and Closure, 2005}}\nIn 2005, the [[United States Department of Defense]] announced that Fort Dix would be affected by a [[Base Realignment and Closure]]. For base operations support, it became part of [[Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst]], N.J. It was the first base of its kind in the United States and is the Department of Defense's only tri-service joint base.

In 1991, Dix trained [[Kuwait]]i civilians in basic military skills so they could take part in their country's liberation.<ref name=\"Dix\"/>\n\nDix ended its active Army training mission in 1991 due to [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] recommendations, which ended its command by a two-star general.

The [[USAF]] moved the Security Police Air Base Ground Defence school from [[Camp Bullis]], Texas, to Dix in fall 1987. It was eventually realized that it was not cost effective to put 50\u2013100 S.P. trainees on a commercial flight from San Antonio, Texas, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, every couple of weeks, so the school was later moved back to Camp Bullis, Texas.\n\nFort Dix was an early casualty of the first [[Base Realignment and Closure]] process in the early 1990s, after having lost it traditional basic-training mission. But Fort Dix advocates attracted Army Reserve interest in keeping the {{convert|31000|acre|ha|adj=on}} post as a training reservation. With the reserves, and millions of dollars for improvements, Fort Dix has grown again to employ 3,000. As many as 15,000 troops train there on weekends, and the post has been a major mobilization point for reserve and National Guard troops since the [[September 11 attacks]] on [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nFort Dix has completed its realignment from an individual training center to a [[United States Army Forces Command|FORSCOM]] Power Projection Platform for the Northeastern United States under the command and control of the Army's Installation Management Command. Primary missions include training and providing regional base operations support to on-post and off-post active component and U.S Army Reserve units, soldiers, families and retirees. Fort Dix supported more than 1.1 million man-days of training in 1998. A daily average of more than 13,500 persons live or work within the garrison and its tenant organizations. [[Fort Devens|Devens Reserve Force Training Area, MA]] is a sub-installation of the ASA.\n\n===2005 realignments===\n{{main|Base Realignment and Closure, 2005}}\nIn 2005, the [[United States Department of Defense]] announced that Fort Dix would be affected by a [[Base Realignment and Closure]].
